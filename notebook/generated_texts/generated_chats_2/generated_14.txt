Start of the conversation...this is one interesting thing
so I will write what is not like we cannot not have it
no
but can we take this um because in Belgium one of the more interesting part
sorry I said this with you this was something I thought you mentioned uh like I will make a post on that now
yeah
but why would you just follow that and I think the reason for this I can't explain that right I mean the reason why that is that that was like an interesting thing
and what like I was thinking before you mentioned yesterday you were you were talking about the audience here with the people because when I did that I like I really I felt like in that way that we have such a close circle with the audience and that somehow we want to stay there for the audience so that we can be that audience then when you're talking with the audience the audience has to be there for me to like see this like there are some people who are different from the audience
