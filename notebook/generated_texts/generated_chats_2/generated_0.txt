Start of the conversation... and we go down to some distance
and then we see the scene we see the next moment there is a huge explosion of the Earth right there
yeah
yeah
the explosion of the Planet of Earth it's huge
and then I thought it's more like a projection or something
this like massive projection like it's like a kind of a projection but like it's really close to the planet as what I was saying
and that's like when we were like walking we were the one who found this um interesting to see I mean like the idea is to make sure that whatever person is seeing we know that the person you see in person of these things that we know it's a projection
right
okay
so I see my um
and then like I see it's
like at the same time I started to see it's like in the space and then I started making more like what you know I was thinking like this
right
yeah
but
