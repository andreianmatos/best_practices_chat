Start of the conversation... I mean we have to get back to talking so we can see more about it later we can get in a bit bit more to figure that out
yeah
we should go ahead and try to find something that's useful
so I hope to see it as a good experience that somehow that helps me to work towards the project or maybe something like that I hope will come down to the way
and then we can just come back on the topic we can see what we want to talk together next week like uh not too much talk about the project or the next project
yeah like I mean the next project
yeah we need to work on another project
yeah
yeah
I mean I don't know I think I'm more in a place where I'm doing something
yeah
yeah
we need to talk because now we need to take a bit more introspection in and of ourselves
yeah
like we need to maybe get some space
yeah
so
thanks
