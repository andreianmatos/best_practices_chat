Start of the conversation...I mean the conversation about all the things that we found is also very nice uh the chat and conversation like this
but the the thing that the most interesting part is how I found it was that there is so much feedback and so much feedback it's not just the idea of uh asking like for feedback or doing things that I didn't put in the presentation that you know like I didn't put it in the slides
but this is I mean it's also I find that it's interesting because it's like it's it's in the background
like people who like the idea are following the process
okay
but I don't quite remember exactly in the in the process
but it's like what I was trying to say was that it's a process in one perspective I would say also about how we're moving so there's some the interaction is not quite right yet
but
like like the things that we do are all the same
yeah
I mean
