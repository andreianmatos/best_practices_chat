Start of the conversation...
yeah in relation to [Music] and the conversation I started I think like like I mean when we try to talk about things in that sense then how I was using my own voice and the uh my the one thing that can be really confusing that this I found that is uh the more relevant I guess is with the um analogy of in terms of uh like you know like the audience of the performance or even for the choreographer uh trying to make his work like more or less like a performance in a space like a theater or like a home
but now because of this conversation that my I'm proposing that people are more or less taking the same approach or different ideas in relation to a choreographer I think is maybe not in that sense because I don't really feel like this is just this is just something that that people cannot just take on as they will a specific performance or choreographer but they can make their own work as a choreographer or a theater dancer which means
