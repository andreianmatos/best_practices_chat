Start of the conversation...
yeah it's not about anything
but like you have no idea what it will be like
yeah
so um so uh
right
so they are speaking I think they were saying to me after last week like I didn't really speak specifically about like that and what's the thing with that like in a short in a way like maybe it's like the two like two questions like how to do like more like a conversation that's not a conversation
I mean like what we should do differently so that's also that's why this topic I talked with I think it's clear about the difference between us to say something and you know to go back to where I thought about it and then like make some kind of analogy where how to do this right from now we have to start speaking in in the practices that we are using in this chat like so that it can be extended into our own practices
but that's what's the purpose of the conversation like as a practice
