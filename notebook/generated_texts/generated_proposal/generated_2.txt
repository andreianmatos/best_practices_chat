Start of the conversation...I mean then I'm like talking to myself
but then I make the same mistake and just make a similar mistake also
yeah
and then I go back and it's always like when I think about the analogy like the analogy between the two is the point where I'm doing something and then I think I'm repeating myself
so the analogy is always like the point is you trying to give another person a way to say the thing that you know will not work, and you try to give another person a different way to say if you think about that the person won't do it is something that you know will not work so then I think what you're trying to do is give some other people one way to say if you think about the performance that you feel will not work and you can give somebody the other option
yeah
but then the difference is there because I know there's so much other than the performer and then the other person so what's up
no
