Start of the conversation... I remember how much I felt like this or that
right I mean
I guess that's like the difference between me trying to be different
and trying to be something that I was thinking uh but it's not that I put up as I would do like I mean
I guess sometimes I start to move or have some interesting things maybe
um
yeah
yeah
and
I mean to like I think what I do is like in a way you put in some kind of I guess a framework that I think I can maybe give some hope or something but with the framework then I can just do things differently with my different ideas that I'm trying to
yeah
but not like like it's somehow that that will break the framework with the things that I think it could work but also it could change the framework I see where I'm trying to do things
okay
yeah
I I thought like what is interesting is actually that is really like different uh strategies
