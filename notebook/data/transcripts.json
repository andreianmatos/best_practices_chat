{"en": {"iDnMcqv3lRU": "hello hey hey oh that's a loft I haven't seen that look he looks super fancy no he look like and this is knowing outside oh wow I guess this is the this is the attic I guess if you got some point I guess you will come here so so this is your your your new room here us have oh nice wow this is this is good for Dancing Yeah Yeah Yeah I didn't show you this like here I can I mean I have my things in boxes but it's a big space and yeah I remember you told me about it but I don't know if I saw it in the picture maybe you sent me picture yeah maybe you sent me yeah but I just don't remember anyways how are you uh a bit tired I'm just back and yeah just from the trip that um my gosh I'm distracted by emails um I went to Kyoto for the weekend and just just for fun just to um join a friend of mine who was there and then we came back together and yeah um so I'm I'm very tired so did you went out like did you did something yeah like last night last night we were hanging out with this so a friend of mine she's Canadian and she visiting from Canada and her friend I think he's also Canadian and he's living in Japan for like more than 10 10 years so he knows you know um like where to hang out but yeah it was it was a bit weird like kind of you know he's really like a party person and we went to like four or five different bars and W you know like he's like always meeting random friends on the way um yeah I mean you know it's it's kind of fun but it was different by guess I mean I guess it's nice because you never do that so but I guess exactly could be tired yeah we didn't really say late it was it was quite early when we when we went um went back but still like it was quite I I drank quite a lot like I decided to drink yesterday and then yeah like you know like normally I don't drink so yeah yeah yeah okay so your brain also is somewhere else yeah and like mean me in the meantime like I have to like help a friend of mine for her project which is also this week so I told her you know like I can't do it this week because we had Modina yeah yeah so may let's talk on that because I have so I have to I also have to work on something else today I would like to have your Fe back on that but not I cannot do it right now and we be late for you so um so I think that tomorrow we have this appointment at 11: right like in meeting right and it's like the first and we said it's like a two hours uh meeting and based on that then we organize basically how the time goes right I'm what I'm thinking somehow like objectively also is that I want I don't want to have to be working the for two weeks too much I think we should maybe frame it in a way that we can reuse part of what we did right like the approach [Music] um um but so what what I think I'm proposing to do right now is that tomorrow think we have to meet tomorrow would be easier to meet early then we talk again you mean before 11 to talk about yeah yeah I mean if it works for you I think that would be good yeah so because 11 already yeah I have to for myself try to fall asleep early so I will try to be at 9:30 online uh so let's aim for that if you can shall we I mean I I don't know because like also the thing is like it can be open right so the way I thinking about like how to organize is like content wise that's something we have to talk with them like you know it's I mean of course like there's something that we need to organize between between us and bring to them but also like you know it's a brainstorming thing so we don't have to like come up with a complete idea when we talk with them but then again we need to organize something like so the thing is like what do we need to talk before talking to them but we need don't need to have 100% right too much time yeah okay so maybe just like one hour will be enough like let's try at 10: if the meeting is at 11 yeah yeah and then and then we'll see no I agree with you that it's a brain session right or like you know it can be even like half an hour I mean yeah because also like I don't want us to be like kind of you know exhausted before that meeting because um yeah but again I know that we need to talk but you know it's also that you know they we can be like honest with them and I think it's not that like of a big issue like it's not like exam so um but again I think for for organization it's it's better like for us to like you know being the common having the Common Ground yeah but it's true that's for sure yeah want to be I think what I want to be honest like I don't I think I want to have some days that we don't like I don't want to feel that we are working a lot so two things I want to feel that we are not doing two different kind of work at this thing we should overlap it because already this will be for I mean uh the academy anyway yeah so that's a practical thing and we have to make sure that we understand how to do it we um and actually no but actually also we can I mean we can mention totally to them like to them like Nuno also knows what is it like right yeah I also I share with Nuno and like I mean that so just so for me like that we are not doing two different kind of works because that it won't then we will do not good any of two of the two so I think we should work towards one thing um right practically yes and and so and then the other thing so that's one thing and then the other so my worries that we are not doing two different things so that I that I feel that we are doing one thing um and the other one is what that they I want to use part we we were working quite hard the last two weeks I think three weeks two weeks so I I want these days that we don't have to work some I mean like in that intensity right right that we can reuse things maybe we can even just do Reflections or like like I mean we can do um I mean also you know that's the days that they can work and after that they don't have time to work basically like yeah it's really limited so we can be you know chill and yeah like ask so we have to come up with work like for these days basically these days and until so from to so tomorrow brain storm and so we talk I think there's some point that I will bring let's let's say like we meet at 10: that's like one hour before right yeah the the official meeting is 11 so let's try to meet at 10 and try to finish like in half an hour so we have like a bit time to bit of time to you know away and then come back um but of course if we need to talk for one hour that's also if it's needed then it have to but ideally like not to exhaust before that right uh yeah okay no let's do that then tomorrow then so we just basically do what we're doing today by tomorrow I mean just right yeah I think that's that's better for both of us yeah yeah and we don't talk about you know the brainstorming part but just talk about yeah maybe like vaguely what we're aiming for something like that but we we will have it we have ideas yeah I think it's more about kind of like um I see it almost like a almost like a typological conversation that we should have in terms of structures like meaning that like giving hierarchies of what is important for us I think that's the the conversation that we we need to have tomorrow like then if if so we are not doing the brainstorm but the idea is like that's what I mentioned the typology in the sense of what are thees if you think encoding what are the classes the super classes of what is what it matters to us if we can do a hierarchy for us then um yeah I I was reflecting on this bit uh that is more about we we make clear I think that was the cue why it was working what we present at the Academy because it because they were structure in like Our intention was clear so I think we should also make the intent for the interaction with them what we need from them right clear and that should be like something that we agree yeah yeah and I think that's because we are in comp we are in complex spaces but I think that's good that we are doing this exercise that because in a way just force us to clar what is the because like we have the Cross Point of the academy is an ex XR as a br research it's a completely different thing but then they you have the artificial intelligence there so it's coming from a different angle but B in way have this inter middle uh I mean but it's just the angles are very different um so it's for us it's just to understand what that we want um uh yeah like so not too much about the content but it's more about this like the intentionality the stru what is that's what I mentioned the typology I don't know may it's know the right right word but here I don't yeah I don't know like topology but no type like type as in typology I think it's science study yeah topology is about the geography I think it's about so it's more about her okay oh types okay types yeah so that's that's that's what I mean in terms of a structure like that was a reflection that I had in my first research on motion Bank working with data that at some point you start saying like Okay while you're dancing maybe you should start if it's about measuring State then it's how you your classes say literally in the code how you organize your code before you start going in the dance uh in in the practice then it's just the the matter how you organize your code how is your uh yeah like how you define your what's important what is what is less important what is less less important and yeah that was just a reflection that I have was in the space because when the coding I also did in the space I thought like ah actually I could have a start also recording this doing that like that that there were some things that that I forgot um so I think when I think when systems get very complex in whatever we're doing and I think what we're doing is getting more complex um helps to have this to communicate somehow like then to Define yeah basically to Define what is more important less important like that's what I I guess of types like what is the most important type the less important type okay that's what I was that's what I was referring like with classes in coding like you know if you think in code then the there are different kinds of classes that you could have some classes are abstract and there yeah there are different classes that you have and each class have a purpose right when you define a class is because you implement the class somewhere else so their classes have their each their purpose so it's about definition of like I mean if a class is just is just uh put all the code into one thing that is called class hand right class hand then is uh about the definition is about the definition of of defining yeah is that that's I think that's the definition of typology is why yeah yeah I don't know it's it's yeah I don't know like I mean I know what you're talking about but it's hard to uh yeah um like like yeah I I kind of understand what you're saying but then at the same time I just don't want to say like yeah I understand because I'm not 100% understanding that's that's where I'm at but I know where you're going to like that's like your intention I know that but yeah I think yeah in other words like it's about like um yeah like it's more about the goal or so it's not about how but like what what but it's also like what it's not about what we want but like yeah basically where we are heading to kind of I don't know yeah I think I mean somehow I think a key word I see is like intention yeah like what istion yeah and and then if intention is clear then you know when there is a question you know how to answer the question because the intention is clear one in this meeting is this so instead if everything is just floating especially when we are doing complex work that it just comes from different places um we will have constantly this abstraction in the in our head like so I mean and also this this idea of the intention is I think it's something that just we is something fluid I guess if we said like what we want this to have a performance where there are 50 people and 20 people they move to the right side and so this is where really clear so this could be like an an idea that it can I mean it's just doesn't have to be stable but at least it just help us to yeah yeah that in terms of detention what is that we want and then the question that yeah but it's not greeting in stone right yeah okay yeah I think we're on the same page and you know so we meet at 10 and then we all just yeah find well we just make sure that we have same ideas yeah yeah we have to do is basically make sure that we that we are like because we get confused that's the thing yeah yeah that's exactly what you want to that's what always mentioning like that my worries like make sure that we are in the same p no so totally like that's also what what I was thinking because we don't want them to be involved in that conversation to figure out what no we don't want them to get involved in this conversation like exactly this mess like because already we know and yeah yeah yeah that's what we don't want to start talking about typology it's a funny conversation actually I I I've been meeting a lot of ADHD people I mean autistic people too but yeah so anyways maybe I'm I'm tuned into that uh mode anyway whatever so we talk tomorrow yes we talk about tomorrow yeah and good luck with your writing whatever thanks thanks thanks good job", "1gBWFcNGyFc": "hey so you were hiking yes it was a it was a long day and we missed the last bus and was but there were like other bus but it just took longer I thought I had to like call my mom to pick me pick us up but it didn't happen so funny and um I I will just I have a slides I think what I will do is I will just I will try I will do the presentation this is the first time I will do it I mean I just I was trying to do it before but I stopped because I want to time I want to time the it seems to me will be can be a bit longer so I I went to time so I will then do this how do this see whole point I guess so if I share what how you do them you say share but uh wait I have I think I have to allow you to share screen yeah that's that's fine now there okay that's St to and automatically it will just do it when I start doing that yeah share to oh can you hear the sound it doesn't matter right now Al because redo it just in case you have to turn it on when you select share screen you have to I think you have to put it you have to close it first stop [Music] share and then share and advance I guess ah share sound yes mono is this I have no idea but whatever is works whatever works I optimize video clip sure whatever uh okay sh let's do this yes oh no you're not supposed to see this okay hi um should I or yeah but yeah what what but should I time should you what time I'm okay sorry yeah okay hi I'm here can you see me I cannot see myself can you see me yes okay there like a little screen little window um so we don't that I cannot see me why I cannot see me is that [Music] normal take your time stop FaceTime why video participants I guess the computer is doing automatically this be I mean if it's like full screen slide maybe that's also something yeah and I think I'm I sleep really little so I think I will just do it like this yeah just do it it's fine yeah okay I'll do it again y wait I need water I need to come back I need water so give me a second take your time take your time oh good does mean oh I do this however you want um hi um why this is starting like it should should be a play button wait play and it should be no I don't want this get annoying why no look at this the St there okay I'll do it like this hi um I'm horor uh thanks for being here tonight it's night for you so that works so what will what you will experience tonight is a research in virtual reality and dance it is the second cycle I'm doing on this subject the first cycle was the develop and motion bank and I focused the research around the dancer in the second cycle in the academy I'm focusing around the audience it's not a performance yet but it's becoming a performance what I present tonight is a work in collaboration with na TOA who was uh one of the previous fellows at the Academy so in this becoming performance I will guide you through the research process uh where we design conduct a study and in our case uh moving recording our body based on an objective scores then we analyze the outcome from the point of view of the audience the research continues by iterating this steps I will only share with you 20 minutes today but I hope you have a glimpse of how I conduct the research and I hope you have fun so I will break down how this will go I will introduce a little bit the background what I do how I do uh and then the context with work I will be sharing with you two videos of about five minutes please note that in these videos there is a mystery pattern that you should try to to solve so keep on that in mind then I will invite one person from the audience to try the mystery on VR and then I will finally reveal the mystery and then I will invite us to move together then I will be sharing a QR code but you can access the current documentation so I do dance technology research uh I have a formal education in contemporary dance and in multimedia design I'm working with dance for about 20 years and with technology for about six seven years um I work in non-binary terms so rather than presenting something good or bad in terms of content I'm more interested in providing options or different angles to enter the artwork I work with the glitch and the error because allow for different elements in a system to be interrelated and in constant reciprocal configuration in other words having some degree of uncertainty en able the boundaries between the artist audience artwork or interface to be more flexible but moreover anything is about having fun and to not be depending on technology in dance a bud is a material that inhabits the space for a certain time one idea is that in V the body as an avatar has more freedom it can expand transform and multiply but in fact an avatar cannot be a person and because of this is difficult for the audience to feel the existence of this person and to have empathy this leads us to a question how can we make a dance in a virtual environment so that the audience feels the presence of the of this digital body and what is needed for the audience to find new Aesthetics one answer might be to enhance the will multimodal feedback system so that the experience feel more realistic like with haptics that can create an experience of touch however this approach introduces The Dilemma of Reliance on external resources another answer might be maybe to prepare ourselves as an audience with a physical body to be uploaded in a digital Space by exploring strategies and opening up to new sensibilities that soften the transition from analog reality to digital worlds so I will be sharing with you the first video now I invite you to consider what is happening in these four videos do you see [Music] patterns why are they moving what can they see that you cannot did you see any colors how about textures what that space looks like can you imagine being there why are they moving River run past Eve and Adams from swerve of shore Bend of bay I want the audience to experience to see that there's uh that everybody will interpret very differently the audience will give a different meaning everybody will do something differently slightly different from a clear pattern but regardless of if you open or not open the art work is there it's just there so we're just experimenting with the different mediums the short C Haas and core re reft from North America on this side and that can be the video I mean in the video we tried different things like drawing and you know like moving hand or moving the body and also we made the composition of the video that's another medium and then you're we're adding the live person that's another thing um so I I think it totally makes sense you know like now the focus is in the hands and the the pen and the paper where the score happens when the movement happens is only there but in the bodies everybody has yeah two legs two arms the whole body the more movement you allow the more uh nuances will happen the more chaos will appear on this side the scratchy is is solid rigid slow grounding always there continuous line modular pixel block kind of Bor kind of boring it's also like how choreographers are doing right like for example also you know like maybe with the space like TR around um like their I don't know methods or technique that's about having dancers to experience something that they haven't experienced yet by defining the cube or um K spere or you know this kind of exactly yeah yeah yeah yeah bring us by a commodious vus of recirculation back to how castle and inir wait I need to okay the short sea had passent core reared from North aror I often do I see like two options very binary and but this is it's yeah hope happens naturally yeah of course you know I mean can't you can't just you know come up with something new it's new because it has a reference it's not it's just coming to existence biert this Amor over the short SE pass in core was if you have feedback you normally see something in the past right past yeah you cannot go in front you cannot go in the future you always can see the past not the future is I mean what I found interesting of the future now that we're speaking is that it force you to go to the magical spiritual sigal space it force you to go to something that is not there so you have to make up something and convince me that it is the future Mose of eope minor to wield their fight I think it's the Earth should be round isn't it like the Earth yeah like I mean that was that waspy theory years ago it was established the Earth is round yes um so I guess it's just a matter of scaling it's just like you are you are in a segment so now that we clarify that the Earth is round uh I would like to invite somebody from the audience to try the mystery in VR and this is what it will take time right this one okay three now please follow with your hands they wi you will see a white circle and then just with your hands and don't tell other people wow where is it hey so now that we glorified and we on build the mystery um h no yes okay so just now we going build the mystery so now now it's time to un build the mystery yeah thanks what you see here is based on a gener narative artwork called Pathfinder which was developed by Mi loair and Rafael hbr and these originally create simple geometrical forms like Square circles triangles and lines and the perform will move accordingly to what it sees so what we did is we went through a series of experiments and we we reduced these geometrical forms to a minimal expression which was a right dot then we follow the dot and we do this uh to reduce the movement interpretation between the performers all right so now that the mystery now this time yes has been revealed and that we all have an objective understanding of why these people were moving like that it's time to move together so please stand up and move the chairs away I still have to find if there will be chairs or not and we will do this in two rounds a first round we we will follow the the dot with a right hand and in the second round you are free to follow the doas you want just be kind and acknowledge that there is other people around in the space if you get lost don't worry just try to look around try and make sense of what is happening and trust me you will be fine ready okay we go all right so first cycle now we do it again and so again this second time you are free to follow the doas you want just be kind that and acknowledge there's other people in the space we do it one more time to round up okay here we go all right uh thank you very much so if you have any questions I don't know if we have time that is like 30 minutes and there you can find this QR code the link to the documentation thanks are you still there who I'm talking to what is not what are you what you can just turn off the screen sharing which because I'm doing this the call is you know we still have like Al give me a second um yeah so let's just stop the call because it has four minutes yeah and then we come back in like two minutes I think they might they have somebody has to come at some point like okay like right now set up for yeah to to to yeah to stop here inside yeah it's fine yeah so it was It's Kind it's almost 30 minutes though no 28 uh yeah 20 29 minutes yeah and I mean that could be yes yes please go so in the talk I took some notes and also I put the time code so that might help you which to know like which part was long which part you can you know where where where is this uh in the chat put the time code yeah I hope it's clear enough but let's see um yeah like wait let me just go through this like to see if I understand know the day I could cut it because people won't get the whole thing anyways maybe just mention Mr code what you yeah we can just go one one uh step by step so like many of the day I just am just not a fan of like this you know table of like the outline thing for the presentation because you know you you got to do it anyways and it isn't really for someone who doesn't know what you're going to present it doesn't really help saying something specific yeah yeah it's not happening something with it yeah but still like I think it's good that you mentioned that you know this mystery code so maybe that's something you have to highlight in that like moment that you know what are we going to work on what are we going to see so so what you're saying that like the idea of the menu of the day not to mention yeah I would I would skip the whole thing because it's just like bombard of information for people okay I will think about it yeah I mean you could probably like simplify or something but in general like okay the outline is you know to me it's it's hard but maybe you could mention what they're supposed to do for example this mystery code you have to solve the mystery that's yeah I think I mean for me for me it was important like to mention that there are two videos that they are 10 minut that's five minutes yeah but but I understand now what you're saying yeah F yeah okay now I get it okay and then after background maybe the last text or split to several slides yeah it's just so I think there are two slides yeah like the background and then you started talking about digital uh yeah Avatar and yeah I think you could break down into like more slides or yeah I mean more slides less text which I think is good and yeah some images would be probably nice back slides first video maybe to mention again first video maybe to mention again what people have to focus on what do you mean oh like what are we supposed to do because you started the video and I think you mentioned something in many of the day but people wouldn't remember what we're supposed to see what we're supposed to focus on when we're watching the video because you didn't really give a context I mean we you gave a context in menu of the day but then you started talking about background so I guess people already got lost you know when we see the first video of the Montage of you know for videos what is happening in this video that's just copied from what you said just does note and then I I think it really works well like that you started to what people so to mention so you mean in then the 444 you mean to mention what people say again so so at 444 you started playing the first video of the grid yeah right yeah and then at first I thought it was really abrupt and I was not sure what to see in the video but then around 6:55 like after like 2 minutes you started to give the narration right on the video yeah so yeah then I thought maybe that's that's like more effective to do it I don't know if probably you intentionally gave some know first two minutes to not to say anything mhm but I would say it's maybe it's good to you know start a bit earlier or from the beginning or you know after one minute so that people don't get lost too much to give the narration or you know to give the context yeah early in the video Chad the just hor stone is very different in the chat it's just like just remark and I mean a good way you know I just noticed that the way you presented you were presenting and versus like how you're talking in the chat is very different and I think it's really nice okay it's just and what about sound like maybe with small white noise I don't know I don't really think it's good idea but I just felt like you know so I I have to say something about the why I put this sound thing because I thought at this point everything becomes repetitive right because anyways like we have to do this exercise like again and again and again again like you watch it over and over and then finally you do it like three four times so I thought like maybe we need to give some kind of like different texture could be sound but then after some time I wrote here but becomes very like meditative meditative or like hypnotic or like you know it really reveals the way we approach this because we do it in a repetitive way and actually it might be like actually it's good to keep it like repetitive and not to entertain people too much so that they can get into this idea of like how we work so but then the sound will be when at that time I thought sound might help but after the whole like run through I thought probably it's better not to have the sound like when it depends I guess yeah it depends but when I wrote this I thought it needs some kind of variation but then after the run through I thought like probably it's good to be a bit boring in a way or like repetitive I'm to say boring but code okay okay okay and so the sound like yeah I can think about it but don't don't think too much you know if you have some kind of idea you can try it out but just just you know yeah not just like because I use White Noise the way who I work I use Brown noise always I so could work uh I could see I could see it I could see if I can but you mean when that will work then I mean when when the mystery is revealed I guess after no reveal or when the volunteer is trying I I don't know to be honest yeah okay yeah I was thinking about this when the volunteer was doing but it's it's very open because Al was introducing I will try and I will see yeah no uh okay have reveal and then explain about Pathfinder what do you mean uh the one I just wrote so I don't know if people would understand what Pathfinder is basically like because this is not something that reacts to the movement but it's just random you know throwing a dice and move the dot or line right and then the idea is that the person who's watching Pathfinder interprets and it's not something reactive but maybe it's not clear enough but then then again is it something that people have to understand probably I mean maybe in a way that maybe you could you know simplify it yeah like a throwing a dice maybe is a good analogy I don't know like a chance Theory well I don't know if people understand this kind of stuff okay okay yeah yeah okay then then move together together I mean I don't have many comments here you have the second round of moving uh which I found it's again it's nice that it becomes like repetitive but it it is actually the our process so it kind of makes sense yeah I also have to see it with the people that mean this will yeah have to with the people yeah but don't don't worry too much you know like because I I would if I would do this I would again like worry about you know are they entertained or not but then maybe it's not about that so you have just have to be brave or you have to yeah just be consistent you know know like so this is like a you know you see the research yeah this is the way we do research yeah just to be honest about it yeah like not to you know you don't need like icing on this yeah and yeah no I think I think it's nice and I guess you finish with Q and A or all yeah so but going back maybe to the okay IDs I completely get it background like okay maybe because this this will take took me a long time uh so like background so less text or split into several slides because that's normally what I don't like I normally like to have lesser slides actually but I I agree like an image will be helpful but then an image of what yeah I mean the thing is like the problem with slide with a lot of text is that people that really divides the attention people started to read but then you they will miss what you're saying or vice versa and that's why I don't like wordy slide and to be honest like I had a problem like when you start switch from menu of the day to the background actually the structure of the slide it looks really similar that I didn't at first notice that you switch to the next slide when you started okay so I mean so they're like preference um right but because you said like so there are two things like one is like the my background and the other one is the the Academy I mean there are two different slides yeah I I missed when the time and like went to put the time code because I was not sure like how you're going through uh but yeah there are two slce yeah I mean two two um contents or whatever wait I'm just going to join you in like here this easier now I'm in three places recording inog no feedback please so share my screen oh I have to enable that yeah should work sure sure what what I'm sharing what are you seeing the whole desktop I think like which color is the desktop you're seeing a light green okay it's this one and okay so this yeah I will just reduce this like through is not necessary for me the important is like so they know there will be videos and there is a mystery basically um and the background so he here is but why no I guess like when I have like more problems like when what is my thing here yeah okay so here between in so this this two slides yeah which is like I mean this is the whole break these two things is what yeah what we were talking about so I I I said it's Sim like this one is similar to the one before right to the menu yeah yeah that that's something I mentioned but I think you will reduce this one so I think it's not the problem but again like this there's a lot of information in this slide right but maybe I mean maybe important for me so maybe I could reduce it like I mean I will think about it yeah because I'm okay yeah I'll think about it yeah to yeah I have to think about it and then so and then this so yeah I understand there's a lot of text in this and there a different there are different things and this yeah this is something like for example I would add like a image of Avatar just give an idea of what you're talking about maybe but I understand you don't want that if you know maybe that kind of makes it specific yeah so like the image no yeah I get the point like would be nice to have an image but then an image of could be just a big question mark like yeah yeah um yeah I see the the thing like very like high level comment is this you talk through these three slides I mean there's also like I think there's intro and then these three three slides so you kind of like from the beginning you talk and then you start showing video but then at this point like if someone lost attention then it feels like really lost because for example if I mean I also have this problem but you know if I'm not following enough at one point then it's hard to come back to what this is happening which is actually not that's the thing like this presentation is something that you don't have to be fully attentive right I mean there like different different levels of focus for the audience it's not like you have to like watch watch listen carefully all the time but it just gives like a feeling that if you start with a lot of talking then it feels for the audience to be like oh like this I have to be really attentive not to miss anything that's something like like I I felt uh but that then this is I think the solution is easy like you just don't like maybe like give some kind of break or talk less or you know or yeah I mean I think definely like definitely I will like this I will reduce this and then I can think on on this yeah like I would even yeah yeah the background part is tricky because I mean that's the way because normally the I tried to avoid it but the way who I I did it is was more instead of saying what I am is more like what I do how I work because it's relevant yeah because also is what I'm saying is the way who it they will see is the way how it will it unfolds in that way um maybe I can check how to then reduce medication why do dance technology and research I'm working on binary terms right right presenting something good or bad in terms of content I'm more interested in providing options and different angles to enter maybe so maybe these things can be or let's say like something completely different I would suggest it's not like you have to do this but for example instead of like going through this in the background you just say keywords I mean this is really like random idea but okay here are the here are here are the keywords that is related to my Approach my work like non-binary uncertainty glitch error so you don't talk but you know just put some wordss then you go to the what you're doing at at the Academy like resarch question for example just just to like break the flow that I'm I'm just trying yeah yeah because similar I yeah I will just try that could be I will try that to see if that happens that works um [Music] background here we have by keywords yeah I will try I could try maybe I I can try to do it right now but what if you take binary TR this right now I said no so D Dance technology research nonbinary providing options or angles glitch error in constant configuration uncertainty enables the boundaries between artists audience artwork on interface okay I think I can maybe could be something in between what you said and the text then then becomes a COR it has so I understand it must change the dynamic so I think I can make it I can make in between both like I use yeah sometimes keywords and sometimes certain phrases I can stop so I can so it becomes it becomes a a piece in itself just that yeah like a narration or like a poem in a way yeah I I just really like how you just like did it quickly like I think it really works yeah yeah I think it can work if I just then select some things yeah that could work yeah and and then for now let's try I will just keep this as it is maybe if I see this because there so there is some intro text this is some text this is just a breakdown and it will be simple then this is kind of like a um more poetic presentation this is a text again so there's a text here could be a text here I think it's fine could be like could be if there is there is a text that is clear here there's a text that is clear here and and then here introduce so here to start with the start early know early talk yeah yeah okay yeah that makes sense the yeah I think I won't I won't focusing I understand like the image but I think the image will compromise myself right now yeah don't do the image don't do the image that was like the comment I was thinking while I was listening to but now I have like bit bit bigger picture and I think it's fine without it because then we have the video so it's also now yeah after this the video um this no I get it I get it okay I think the main point is this is there clear and also it was the first time I did it so it should become more easy totally yeah and I think like again like a general comment is like yeah you know what you're doing so just you know like it's fine you know it just you have to be honest about what you're doing what what you're saying and that's fine you don't have to you know make it more I don't know you you don't have to worry if they are people are understanding or yeah just it's fine they don't understand all the time true I think it's good is so that's why for instance like is if the text if there's a text and I want to keep the text I I can keep it but I understand the Rhythm has to be yeah yeah like let's say like at this point like just don't change the slides but you know just play with the Rhythm and I think that's that's that's good yeah no the menu of the day like totally I yeah this this yeah this maybe you have to reduce a bit but yeah other parts like also like yes yeah like the next slide like I thought you have to like change it drastically but maybe not because this is already like keyword so you can like already like use it if you if you do the keyword you know phrase thing the slide actually works that way yeah yeah this is yeah this could be fun yeah um or you just put the slides what you're going to say which is you know like not it's it's like bad practice for making slides right to like read everything but you could do that here for example you just write in the slides like you know put the notes in the slides basically and just read everything in the slide then you read everything yeah because then for the audience they can follow it and it's actually nice okay um cool but then maybe then which let's do it this tomorrow again then I then I work on this and also I sleep just like three hours today I don't know why like feel like yeah uh um sleep well eat well yes yeah like we have good content so you just have to be healthy yes and I think I mean I think this is I mean this is done it's just is have to do it few times and right yeah it's already like yeah this is done you just have to do it few times and then ad adapt it a bit yeah something I didn't understand is like why the video like the of the I don't know how you notice like I think that I erased like the the fake Call because it will complicate the thing yeah no you don't have to do I was like yeah I think it's it's good this way like without it and anyways I especially because they will have to move there are many things at the same time happening at that moment they have to stand up yeah they there's a lot going on right no no no it's it's good that way and the way I recorded was more like you know just to try it out if it works or not so it's good like yeah but I wanted to ask you like I don't know why the quality of the video run better sure to bend yeah because it's it's a YouTube the audience to experience to see that it's YouTube because it was a recording of YouTube and then you know the quality was not good at first if you're if you're bothered with this I can try to you know do it again with like proper setting okay well let's let's talk later like I I want to say yeah let's SK in touch okay yeah experiment tomorrow yeah yeah yeah and thanks for stop it stop it stop it", "c6zZyZh__Bk": "hello hello y what's up looks cold is it cold yes it's cold it's a bit sad to see you like that I'm freezing H yeah I think it works like how like the the last thing that you make maybe maybe I want to watch together with you yeah and we let's start that uh movies revision and I'm going to do screen [Applause] share what oh yeah oh no I didn't do the wait I forgot to do the [Music] sound okay uh should I keep the cursor here so you can see the time or no sorry yep uh yeah then I can see the time things yeah wait I'll just keep it like maybe here okay River run past Eve and Adams from swerve of shore to bend of bay I want the to experience to see that there's uh that everybody will interpret very differently the audience will give a different meaning everybody will do something differently slightly different from a clear pattern but regardless of if you open or not open the art work is there it's just there so we're just experimenting with the different mediums the short C have pass and core re red from North amorica on this side and that can be the video I mean in the video we try different things like drawing and you know like moving hand or moving the body and also we made the composition of the video that's another medium and then you're we're adding the live person that's another thing um so I it totally makes sense you know like now the focus is in the hands and the the pen and the paper where the score happens when the movement happens is only there but in the bodies everybody has yeah two legs two arms the whole body the more movement you allow the more uh nuances will happen the more chaos will appear on this side the Scrat is is solid rigid slow grounding always there continuous line modular pixel Block it's kind of boring kind of boring it's also like how choreographers are doing right like for example also you know like maybe with the space like T around um like their I don't know methods or technique that's about having dancers to experience something that they haven't experienced yet by defining the cube or um kinesphere or you know this kind of exactly yeah yeah yeah yeah bring us by a commodious vus of recirculation back to house castle and in Bon wait I need to okay the short sea had passeng core re arrived from North aror I often do I see like two options very binary but this is it's yeah hope happens naturally yeah of course you know I mean can't you can't just you know come up with something new it's new because this has a reference it's not it's just coming to existence all viert theor for over the short sea H pass in core because if you have a feedback you normally see something in the past right past yeah you canot go in front you cannot go in the future you always can see the past but not the future is I mean what I found interesting of the future now that we're speaking is that it forc you to go to the magical spiritual s ual space it force you to go to something that is not there so you have to make up something and convince me that it is the future moves of eope minor to will their fight I think it's the Earth should be round isn't it like the Earth yeah like I mean that waspy theory years ago it was established the Earth is round yes um so I guess it's just a matter of scaling it's just like you are you are in a segment okay yeah I think the video works you know what I was thinking maybe what what if let's do this right now like I'll just check uh try to uh Play in YouTube the video of YouTube like the previous one that you upload I don't know did you upload this one already YouTube no this one is on YouTube too I mean yeah did it unlisted yeah so just send me just uh maybe play this video from YouTube and uh let put the the subtitles The caption I want to see what happened because that will be up I wonder if it already Works wait how I mean it works before because I'm checking like sometimes when we talk like it it really works okay okay do the chats yeah let's see so let me just check first oh yeah I think it's working it work share screen video this one so I'm going to make it full screen yes and start River Run pass Eve and Adams from swerve of shore to bend of bay I want the audience to experience there's a second what yeah put it from the beginning like sorry yeah start it again yeah River run past Eve and Adams from swerve of shore to bend of bay I want the audience to experience to see that there's uh that everybody will interpret very differently the audience will give a different meaning everybody will do something differently slightly different from a clear pattern but regardless of if you open or not open the art work is there it's just there so we're just experimenting with the different mediums the short c ha has in core re Reed from North amorica on this side and that can be the video I mean in the video we try different things like drawing and you know like moving hand or moving the body and also we made the composition of the video that's another medium and then you're we're adding the live person that's another thing um so I I think it totally makes sense you know like now the focus is in the hands and the the pen and the paper where the score happens when the movement happens is only there but in the bodies everybody has yeah two legs to Arms the whole body the more you allow the more this is so no uh inclusive when I said this but we're going to change it I mean because I said everybody has two legs two arms that's not true I mean one can argue you know what I mean but we're going to change it we're going to change you know the purpose like yeah I mean could you know if someone says then we can say that everybody in this video yeah actually it's a good answer yeah everybody this but also everybody it depends of the perspective like might be different lims or this is so wrong uh anyway but I saw that like okay it depends if somebody wants to really be a p in the you can just go there but yeah just yeah yeah sorry I didn't think it's a good point from the beginning of this part this part yeah you know like now the focus is in the hands and the the pen and the paper where the score happens when the movement happens is only there but in the bodies everybody has yeah two legs two arms the whole body the more movement you allow the more H nuances will happen the more chaos will appear on this side this can you go back like the beginning again I got lost the in the of this part I was just waiting for okay you know like now the focus is in the hands and the the pen and the paper where the score happens when the movement happens it's only there but in the bodies everybody has yeah to legs to Arms the whole body the more movement you allow the more uh nuances will happen the more chaos will appear on the side the scratchy is is solid rigid slow grounding always there continuous line modular pixel Block it's kind of boring kind of boring it's also like how choreographers are doing right like for example also you know like maybe with the space like T around um like their I don't know methods or technique that's about having dancers to experience something that they haven't experienced yet by defining the cube or um K sphere or you know this kind of exactly yeah yeah yeah bring us by a commod used because of recirculation back to house castle and in pons wait I need to okay the short sea had passent core reared from North AR Mora I often do I see like two options very binary but this is it's yeah I hope happens naturally yeah of course you know I mean can't you can't just you know come up with something new it's new because it has a reference it's not it's just come to existence B alert the Amor for over the short sea how pass in core because if you have a feedback you normally see something in the past right past yeah you cannot go in front you cannot go in the future you always can see the past but not the future is I mean what I found interesting of the future now that we're speaking is that it forc you to go to the magical spiritual sigal space it force you to go to something that is not there so you have to make up something and convince me that it is the future moves of E minor to will their fight I think it's the Earth should be round isn't it like the Earth yeah like I mean that was that was Theory years ago it was established the Earth is round um so I guess it's just a matter of es scaling it's just like you are you are in a segment so and this is 446 right River uh 446 yeah and how long is the one of check um the Montage this is five yeah bit more so both both together are like 10 okay good um so I don't know maybe I will I guess I will put it because I think I should we should use it with the subtitle I think it works better also for people who it's true look quite good the subtitles yeah I think it's kind of like understandable right yeah yeah when not because I when I tried some years ago it was not good at all like now it's quite Yeah because sometimes I use like yeah when you have really different accents with some words like that will be difficult to understand and yeah the only time is like when we talk at the same time it's gets a bit confused but true but yeah it gives I mean especially for somebody who is not used to I mean here in Germany the people not everybody has like the same level you know it's different in the Netherlands or yeah in small countries right Scandinavia Germany people not everybody speak like a kind of okay can we actually put it into German I think you have yeah I think there's an option do it try it like check like share screen again this start with there that's up I like run it for like one minute run past Eve and Adams from swerve of shore to bend of bay I want the audience to experience to see there's uh that everybody will interpret very differently the audience will give a different meaning everybody will do something differently slightly different from a clear pattern but regardless of if you open or not open the art work is there it's just there so we're just experimenting with the different mediums the short C in core yeah I feel This is distracting I don't know if this is coming yeah I think too much too much because already the text is not completely clear in I mean in English I mean we are playing exactly and then people start to see like oh this is wrong this is wrong and that's like so what I will say maybe is like I will just try to put it just like in from internet because I want them just to have the the the footage actually so not to have it to need it to from internet oh but I but I will just like now I will just put it in the slides that I'm working on that and then I will just see if there is the need to to maybe just maybe record maybe a screen you need to do it with OBS maybe uh sure yeah you can maybe do it that yeah do it we just have it already in case that we need it because it might be that it's just but yeah just you do it um I also like so I did my well I put the in the chat so the menu of the day I call it okay does that understand if you read that I mean the sorry okay yeah like the agenda that's the agenda yeah maybe call it agenda because I didn't know how to call it well I kind of like it menu of the day it sounds like you know at the restaurant yeah but it's going to happen so so I think so it's certain and summarized like guess in the slide I will put it without the minutes and so it's there and I like what you wrote I I guess I have to put it in my own words of course yeah and from the video call I thought we have to take test but uh I mean I saw like was kind of clear I mean I saw it without seeing your script um and that's nice that you put the microphone what I thought it could be just blond no blend like because I think I depends I mean I hope my I guess I will try to to be in in this mood there is like I mean trying to give energy to the people so ideas then I will set them like you know from the moment from the beginning that is fun that is not so serious that's part of the way who I was trying to introduce me and be also with the space um well don't say it's not serious but you can say playful playful okay maybe just is is serious it's playful okay what you will okay maybe I will put it in my notes because but it's good that you said yeah playful this is playful please I'll just put it here for now please have fun it is playful please have fun and so at some point I said what yeah that there's a mystery pattern that they you must try to find out and then there's revealing of the mystery it's like wow what a mystery um I think with the audience I also will keep it I think that I will call with one person from the audience and deal with that like I mean to be somebody that that maybe I will I will see how it goes in the day I might but somebody will be there and then we'll see it might not work and then that's fine but I guess that's why I guess in the introduction I must say it somehow I don't see yeah I need to say somehow that things are not working always and that's fine right but so I need to I need to do something like because that for me is important like that's what I mentioned in different words of uncertainty on this like to say to the people that things are not work especially when technology are not always working in the way you want so being dependent on that is really being dependent that everything will flow perfectly in technology working at that intersection is not a good approach right right oh just what I said like this is what I need to say like ah well things don't always work things don't always work yes I always put it in my notes Chad depending depending of the technology dep of Technology what I say like every time I hate it like I can my words are so complicated when I speak is simple uh depending technology things so the things not always work right and the being depending on technology is not is not an approach that I will suggest at least that's I mean that's not that approach that I take like I don't like to be dependent on technology because in my experience is the technology is really unreliable so yeah what did I say not to rely on technology not to rely on be depend dependent on my approaches be depending depending on technology because because technology is but it fails because because or it doesn't always work yeah so like the whole thing is like I mean the problem is not that it's not working but the problem is like if you want to in a performance or in a setup in a that's the thing in a life setup that's that's the thing no in a life setup so like performance that a Life Is Life art um being dependent like the problem in a life setup is that um things not always working the same in the way that you would expect not in Japanese is not helping now actually this is super clear you know like because in Performing Arts in Performing Arts like things also I in performances things are not always in the same way every day is different performance so and then the performance and everybody adapts around that right yeah so then I think I think it's a good would approach also to doing technology to not be I mean to just adapt to what is happening right things because things don't work in the way you expect in L in life set up my Approach is B yeah I think it's like that my Approach is not be depending technology y good [Music] space and maybe then then I can say like something because this is what we do like this is what we I think that's why I thought like like to allow for the the VR or something to allow a little bit of space for the chaos uh is because of that and because we have experience with you in doing that and I was thinking Al that it will be just I think it will be just really fun for me to do this I was reflecting on be the way the way how we work and and I think I would like to then develop more this way is quite it's it's quite easy know like I mean it's quite easy in the in the way how we try to not suffer in the performance now we try to go along with the yeah like to not suffer to not make it like a yeah like yeah to play basically I mean staged but we just find different ways yeah because we do it for our works you know like when we well like work like when we work for other people that's what that's what I like somehow like and that's what I would be curious and that's what I think like with the with the Slovenia is like could be interesting is that somehow it seems and that and I'm think that we should develop on that way I think we are in a way kind of breaking this some barrier some some W between you know in a performance there is like still there is an object and there is intention there is you know you go and sit and you give attention to guess almost try to have this classical immediacy of getting being lost within the art piece as an audience why you go and see it and then you say in performance you try to give a space for the art to take you to certain place but in the way how we are doing it is it's not that it's completely a part of that depending of the setups but it's just I guess what I'm saying is like the distance between the a say in a performances like this also I will said even in even in a museum that is not life art there is a distance between the artwork of the audience uh we are more close like what we present also the language that we use on the way how we trying way to do to or at least that's the process that we are we are trying to invite more people in right in that process so that they feel that they can I mean that they're not so far away from the artwork I guess yeah I mean it's there are like different strategies right like the way I see like a lot is like we try to give a lot of like entry points to people so that they can choose where they enter so they don't have to fit in that space I mean somehow yes but like the practices are like that you know like we just have a lot of things and then they can say they like this or they don't like this but you know they can find what they like right yeah yeah but I think like what maybe I guess what I'm trying to underline that I think that I would like to work more around that area is because I mean we should be able to put it in words and me and develop on that is I guess what I mentioned with not being too serious like it's normally art is very it's very serious you know like like oh and you know especially like contemporary dance is like very dramatic and you know like you have always and like is so everything is very dramatic uh so there is always this thing um that is fine I mean it's totally fine but I guess the way who I see it that we do it is that I think um I don't know I see that is yeah in a way I guess I will say is more the distance between the I mean if in a way for the drama to happens you need the dancer in a certain place and the audience in certain place to kind of contemplate the art you know like to get in this immediates IMM mediacy and contemplation um because if you get too close then it doesn't work uh you lose you lose the magic um of the apparatus of the theater right um is that I think we are close to the audience and and yet we because we are working with the apparatus of the theater I I I guess what we I think just we it seems to me there is something there's performative but also there is informative that's what I me maybe we should find a word there's not a Lector performance but there is it's something that is playful and but still it is an artwor in it is an art work yeah yeah like like how I did the performance in Colombia also so like I was talking and you know it's but it's not lecture you know I don't know like the long the long performance you did yeah it's a bit different but you know it's it's also like about being honest and just putting there but then what I'm seeing I guess that's my question is like because I don't know so far in what how we do things is once you put a stage say like when once there is a big space that's why I think the Slovenia thing was like extreme once you put a place where you can place 500 people in an audience um so there is a lot of space in between you on the audience right how is that you generate that connection how if you see what I'm saying in a way is like we speak about intimacy like of being in a space like also because the way how we develop um like best practices was always I mean people there were not too many people following so it's but the people who were very interested so like the orence was not so big so just naturally was a small and intim space almost of friends like being around but now if what we trying to do is like then to to yeah to allow other people and then if you have more space how can still you have that level of trust but I think so like the way I did like this long performance in Colombia was like I didn't really think about who's coming I mean no I did think about it but it's more about I do it for friends so I don't really care someone who doesn't know me just randomly there I mean it's not that I don't care but I'm not trying to you know explain everything I just do it for my friends who knows me and then if I but if it's not but that doesn't mean that I'm like slacking off I'm not you know I I am putting energy for my friends and that's good and I think that's like could be like one way of doing it that that because we have a circle of you know people who's we already share the intimacy and just invite them just do something for them that other people can also maybe get something or maybe not but I mean that's the tricky like how that's I guess what I'm trying to find like because I mean that's what art I guess the state of the art of contemporary dance that the place where I guess I I was coming from that's why I guess I also I take a step away from that is you get so much into a research space that is become self-referential so that just your friends or your colleagues will understand what you're doing so then how it still you can give entry points for other people and it still keep and it still gives and still do your work I think yeah I think we have to come back to this later like after this week but the way I think is like there is a way to do it for the Clos Circle but not being self- referential I think that's two different things and the problem is that when you become self- referential that you know they need basically they need to know something right to understand that's that's problem when you get self- referential so you mean there's information they cannot ask that they don't have so that's why if they don't know they they don't know and they don't get it but then yeah but that's about knowledge but then probably is different part yeah yeah yeah yeah but that's what I guess what I meant when when I said like it's not so serious I I like to use those words always but it's I guess like it's more useful say playful or word because then it's not about like sharing knowledge when you said what you know because then it's true then people who don't have access to certain information that will know if what you're trying to share is knowledge but if it's something different than just [Music] um yeah a dialectic approach um then then it's um yeah is different than than yeah I think that Pro I think you're right in that yeah it could be like you know more like experiential that you know something that with a already intimate people we already shared we have shared experience which is I mean no it's which is the funny thing with the that's what is interesting with science in these days is because that I mean we talk at some point of that that science until not too long ago the experience was not really counting science you always you were counting the science scientific methods but then when you start speaking of like like this new turn of Science and and I guess that came more from that the quantum physics um then then the experience count like not only an objective true but a subjective experience counts so the fact that you don't know certain information in biology and chemic whatever uh is it will not put you away necessarily because everybody has experience right and it's just a different angle of what you're working on yeah yeah and they can relate to it so you even even though or yeah even if I don't share intimate intimacy with someone yet if we have some kind of experience that is not shared but if we can relate enough then that's good enough like that's why like people like my cards because they don't know me but they can relate to their experience looking at the cards you know some things some things might not be relatable but you know that's why it's interesting right so relationality um okay maybe like we can come back for a second like just close it and come back y okay let's run out run round this up yeah by the way uh speaking about the Clos Circle I think uh I was I I kept thinking like I should send these videos to Annie because I think I mean if she has time like she might give us interesting comments not and Annie's in Holland like I think we should go to Holland to this thing to the Moco thing but I think Annie will be the worst I don't know like I mean like because that's I mean the worst in the sense of like I don't know how interested she is in this academic thing because like this is like the super academic thing she's she's involved in some academic stuff I mean not M but I don't know if she's ever be part of that but I yeah yeah but I think like so we have time to that but I think we should be there and Annie is there in Holland right Al like the 10 years of this this initiative and yeah um go back to this so tomorrow I have a meeting with the people with actually with the tech people oh yeah to put a stage there um so I will have the stage design fixed somehow then I'm working so today I working the slides we why is it doing Japanese that um so I guess what it comes tomorrow is like May should have the things in pieces and then try to rehearse we need to still Define I guess we still need to Define how to deal with the last part oh I didn't I lose my uh thought so what I was trying to say that regardless of like the on this last part with you in the space is the one approach could be just like like blent I mean just saying like you know doing two things one is like you're saying like you are you know that is you're surprised that you are Japan and you are joining us like kind of like giving the this hype that for yeah it's nice for you that you are there but at the same time just like literally just dragging a video and then just play and then just that you just literally one one thing could be that and it's easier like um also because it's so fast so I don't know I mean that's one way who I thought like that could be one way also like to deal with that is you just literally just tell them this is happening now and then just you put a video um and yeah that's one one way who I thought that could be but can be something also we'll see we have I guess we will just see in yeah like once we are doing it that um uh I might think that the video might be a bit too short because it's like wait I'm gonna see the video with you is this now now to f where should I even see I need the okay can you hear me now good okay so I hope you're enjoying the open house today so it's from 30 okay so it's like two minutes they're thinking how in this how in this script it comes because I need to ask them to stand up I don't know if there will be I guess I I wish it will not but I guess there will be chairs I thought will be it's nicer if the people are standing but maybe it's EAS here just to put chairs there because it's 20 minutes to be there yeah and not not everybody I mean I sit on the floor but not everybody will do that so could be I need to find in the flow how this come right because I need to do the thing to introduce you and then to do this together um so I guess let's deal with this tomorrow we have time for this I think important is that we we do it in I put the slides now together and then we try to do it with the slides right yeah maybe so maybe like so to do is maybe to record yeah now to record video with subtitles yeah that's it and I'll send you the video of me the fake Call thingy because you need a video right the video file yeah yeah yeah yeah but also can you put there the links because now they are Al online right so where is it this reest chip thingy no no what okay uh and here River run past Eve and wait no this is the last version this is the last version of this I'll just put it here I'll replace this rision I don't know what it is okay now do that how you call the last one revision yeah yeah and this is the one who is here in the in the to-do come try to see where is the uh no to do one is the old one okay sorry no you put it there yeah yeah no better just you put it there um so this is the chat this is the one this is the the the last version yeah yeah I think it's is here I guess if you yeah send me the video with the subtitles y oh yeah so this I need to subtitled so I'll maybe erase it for now link no because it's there what do you mean because we need the subtitle right oh the YouTube yes it's already YouTube is there like always subtitles Chad YouTube what two videos montage video there montage video actually YouTube I think it's this one now I have like so many versions yeah now like confused then yeah oh all I think this is correct yeah I just need to generate this and yeah okay so this is the Montage this is the the normal one okay I understand this yeah I understand this then Montage of what yeah should do this and what is the second what the first one is called montage video and the second one what is it YouTube it's just the YouTube link yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah just in case no yeah I just put I'll call it call it drive maybe then then I know where is it drive YouTube chat YouTube yeah so yeah so you're putting this there yeah and then drive and YouTube yeah yeah that's that's clear good and cool so I I will be tomorrow early there so I think tomorrow we can I mean depends how are you but maybe we can try a bit early like maybe because I have to be there early at 11 so maybe we could try to aim for maybe one or two depends yeah like yeah but maybe I'll try depends I guess how I I I would work today but I will aim for one but I let you know tomorrow okay one is like 900 p.m. here so should be fine yeah one I mean one or two yeah if I'm working there at 11: and 11 I do things with them at 12 one let you know because you will be awake anyway how it goes yeah let you know how it goes with them I something that I I I wanted to mention just now is that I start thinking because we need to have this conversation in parallel I although now we focus in the academy is this sort artificial intelligence I think that I if you see here in the in the document where are you pointing yeah yeah in the Modina section um now we don't have the schedule anymore no this actually these questions are from these questions are actually part of the academy yeah okay somehow um this also I'll just try to do this [Music] maybe yeah at least a little bit okay and so it's there so I was thinking that that artificial artificial intelligence as a as a full new entity with human alike agency within the framework could be an entry point for narratives like yeah so I was thinking that like because the talk we the conversation that we're having was like directly how to apply artificial intelligence right right but maybe another take could be um um before even we know if it's possible or it's not possible but I'm interested in in working uh to start talking maybe of of this an entity like something that is there something because that because that doesn't Nar that can give space for narrative so and already that was part of the of the application but then then we can start thinking that that is an entity that it I see it that it has a humanik um um characteristics [Music] um and then we can you know could be could be something that we can even feed the start feeding are like based on on on things that we have so could be could be an um I don't know even s like an example could be a speech based um um model B based on gp3 or something that see we can fit it with a lot of things that we have done or gri right okay and then maybe based on that we can start saying to that like okay create a character of something and um so in one hand we can start using wait what I'm saying is different things what I'm saying is like we can start thinking of this like more from the point of view of of a of an entity I don't see it as a person but we can speak of a person because maybe it's easy right now like like it's like say it's a third person it's a third person and then we can use artificial intelligence to make that person um rather than just like only like the artificial intelligence as a tool then we could use this more to create a person and then we Define what that we want to create for instance what is that we want to create I was thinking like it could be also like combination of like what you just described and the editor thing you know it could be just I mean I'm not trying to simplify it but know the third person who's coding or not doesn't have to be just coding but you know maybe saying something but no but this is I mean because this is the process that I think we have to go is like is that we have to imagine things that regardless of what exist and I think maybe that could be your role then uh I mean in a way I will say like this is a process that has to be both we have to do the two two sides like at least in Consulting also um but I guess but I will try to push more is like trying to imagine um uh like what I'm trying to do right now like trying to find and to create this entity regardless of if it's possible or not and then I think maybe you should think also that but from the designer coder programing perspective also which is what you're doing how we can basically make that into something that it's possible yeah yeah um so but I guess we should be in constant relation because that's I think that could be a good way to to go around that [Music] um yeah and then yeah I make a rabbit maybe make a rabbit remember like always presented in time we can take one of the dogs that you have with floor how we can install artificial intelligence at the dog and the dog becomes is is doing things by itself like the dog and we we explain it like in the conversation we use artificial intelligence in a very smart way now the dog can decide if it goes front back right or left by itself and it can bark it can bark when he wants when he wants we use artificial intelligence when and the dog is autonomous it does all these things by itself yeah but I think it's like when you say this idea I think it's nice to like think about you know what's the representation like what's avatar or is it the robot that's what I could be interesting and I start seeing also when I'm seeing that we put this thing together that like because also I have the BR headset that we can use these things like because then we can use a be headset because it's also now I'm seeing that it's something that it is part of something you know it just it is when I see it in the way we presented at least now for this week it is one thing but it's not the dominant thing right so [Music] um I think we need Pro what I'm saying is that it seems that I need I think we need drama we need problems real problems somehow like drama like narratives and I think like thinking on rather than imposing a story or something could be from the creation of a I mean already that's a problem you create we have been like and this is not far away from our experience we have been working all this time we want to introduce a third person I want to work with that person the differ is this person is not human and we can create the person so what do we need this person to be or like how much is our God process in it like how much are we want to be involved in the making process of the person do we want the person to discover itself within the the doing uh how much control you want um I think those are questions that you that that maybe we should take out from this conversation I think I think those questions now are kind of clear right because it somehow it's like it seems like this person needs to understand it needs to understand something from it like why is there it needs to have a purpose why is why is there so we need to Define some purpose like the purpose could be you are here to help the audience like through the interface to create glitches through Hydra you know could be that uh but already doing this in this way and then use it within the performance and this is a narrative I share my screen oh yeah it works this is my phone like I went to the exhibition yesterday and this is It's like a you know kind of parody of Power Ranger it looks like power like superhero something but it's actually like these like uh cleaning robots like vacuum robots but they have like different characters and this even has like dessert on it will be amazing like did we s this with dude like in Hamburg like what will be nice to work with uh with vacuum cleaners what's that will be nice like we saw this in in Hamburg with you know there was a performance where they were using vacum cleaners in the space was it oh is it like this dystopian thing we saw it yeah we saw it together in in when we were in Hamburg at the comp nuget like the one that lifts the stage at the end yeah there are different things happening and then then liquids and like dystopian like waste and you know like I don't know how how how it was but yeah I I remember they had a lot of robots right like the segue kind of stuff and yeah yeah yeah like that could be like nice to have a a vacuum cleaner would be nice it's it's not that expensive right no I mean and we have like I mean they can buy it for for Slovenia like and they can keep it to clean clean the stage we just need to learn how to hack that and I'm sure that already should be people who did it that we need just to have to have something um I mean this is just like some throwing things out like could be um like that could be a manifestation um also I was thinking I reading like you know a simple um kect or something alike or even just with web cameras where people see yeah should be more like with web cameras through hide or something with people see like the reaction of like the EM change it but there should be all there should be something behind that what if for instance setting the space there is somehow there is the projection of this and then so meaning that the people understand if you go there and you move the image change you know like the typical setup of something happens physic when you physically intera but what if when the people try they arrive there then the thing because it's in a vacuum cleaner or something that it moves it just moves away so the person needs to try to always go and catch it because the thing is never every time that the the the person arrives the thing will will go right I'm pretty sure there are some installations like that but I don't know if I know anything and this is very simp and this is very simple but but it could give something already I mean there's two different things one is like the the image wants to happen but the robot or whatever is that it moves it doesn't want that to happen for some [Music] reason what is like animal they just like you know go away it's like what they just go away if you go CL I mean depends on animal like birds they would go away they're afraid of you yeah and I and I think we should go like in an intelligent whatever we decide to do we have to come back on this conversation it doesn't have to go deep into say we decide to go with the with the back vacum cleaner it doesn't have to that we need to be like super into Robotics and then make understanding of what is going to happen but still like give some entry point um of because I think I think it's it's something about the physical manifestation of this entity St yeah yeah that's important yeah to have the representation all right and this is something that is because I mean I I read the text but I think maybe I share it with you later these days um yeah but I think they clarify it sometimes becomes a bit complex but they clarify at least in words this relational the relation relationality or yeah relational aspect between the technology and and the human wait something that maybe I can't remember correct is they say like in in there was the example of an interact of a this classical setup of an installation where the hum you you go and when you go then there's a connect or something and then something is happening right they were talking about an the interface so they were saying that that you need something that is surprising for the um event to keep on uh I mean for for the for the person to find new meanings the they should be surprises the there should be new meanings new rediscovering constantly for the installation to to keep on happening so they mention like the installation and the person so when the person start moving and then they the person understand if I move my hand this happens is the person that is the interface in a way like so the person one in the book they were arguing the person is the interface because it connects the artwork with the person but they were also saying that uh the way how that uh relation is established is through representation yes that's the whole point like through mimes like the person goes and start like just going in this process of like this is my hand my hand moves here so that's in a representational process and and then also the computer will do this mimic process like so a classic understanding through representation very simple a very um yeah very simple but then they said the only way who this thing can keep on happening or when becomes a piece of art is when there are they call it uh yeah surprises or I guess could we can set up glitches also is when while you're doing also this you think that other there are other things happening so not only the the representation aspect that is quite clear but there are Surprises with within that so in they were saying that they in the example because there were some lights in certain ways you start experiencing then your body differently so it was something that was not planned but it was a surprise so it's kind of a mistake that is these mistakes or these glitches are the ones that keep the the the process of uh interesting for both sides otherwise it's just represent but it is but it must it must be but in any way so I guess what what I'm trying to say simply is that in that case you the way how you establish the relationship with the interface is through representation and through a basic um yes to representation of through mimesis so through a really basic understanding of what is happening in front of you right but but the only way to make something out of that is when mistakes or she call it surprises happen so when you give more space which is I was making the connection to what we doing when you give space to see Al other things um that cannot be planned also but just things that are in the space is when new meanings can happen and when the uh the installation becomes something else like when you say this surprises like is it something that for example if it's like following the hand it's stops following the hand or like for like basic example okay yeah could be like because that's a mistake I mean there I I think they were more clear with that but I think like the whole point is like that those things are things that you cannot if I mean if it's a good of we speak we can speak about glitches then if it's a good GL but let's call it surprise if it's a good surprise the surprise is only she's saying that the surprises are the ones who maintain it interesting the installation the interface by itself is not interesting Al the person by all the pro only the process not is not interesting is uh so it's only the surprises who help the process to become meaningful and ongoing process and she was saying that these surprises are surprises only if they basically only if they surprise you like only when they when they're happening you cannot uh foreseen a surprise beforehand like because then it's not the surprise exactly that's what I'm trying to say in it's something that must happen so that's why like you can think as a slash slash glitch somehow yeah but it's a circular definition you know it is a surprise because it's a surprise it is yeah but is simple like to I get yeah I understand yeah yeah I mean it I mean this works when it surprises you and even if you intend this feature as surprise if people don't understand I mean if people are not surprised with this feature then it's not a surprise or it's not effective yeah because some yeah okay one could because somehow it's at the end it's about engagement and like for the person to to find meanings um this this is actually interesting part because it's I think it's really specific about installation right because if there's no surprise you could still try to master it quote unquote which is like instrument because instruments I mean you might want surprise but usually you don't want surprise then you can practice and you can play with it like a musical instrument for example it doesn't give you surprise but you practice nobody's have to surprise you know I think it's the same no like sometimes I guess I think there I think it's similar the process like you get or maybe not like that you have to like through some me EC or what she she will call it like uh yeah like through some mimesis and uh approach you will start trying to make the thing work so you need to still like some first some a first level of understanding of how the thing works right otherwise it's just random but yet you if you don't know that is if a guitar like you start doing other things and but then but the rule is clear with the guitar you know it's a physic it's physics but if for example if there's a guitar that you hit the string and every time it's a different sound then you can't really Master it I mean you can Master it as such but you mean every time that you hit the guitar in the the same way if it will if if it will do something differently exactly yeah you cannot Master it there no I mean you can use it as a random generator EV but that's another thing a random guitar that's or like you know I don't know every weekday it will be random but on the weekend it's not random or I don't know whatever if it's sunny it's then there's still a pth but I don't know what I'm saying now but there's this thing that you know I think the way they're describing about installation is something that is experienced in like short duration of time like you you confront installation and you get it but you you're not going to be there for like one hour or like you know you're not going to be there for days right right yeah yeah yeah but then but then on the other hand you know like if it's something like instrument that you can obtain you can practice then that's another story and I think you know yeah in that Cas there's a difference yeah between because then what will be the instrument in a way then you can Master the instrument an installation or I mean could be that you create an installation that is an instrument and that's a purpose but because that that becomes then I guess in that sense because then it is with if we speak about technology it goes almost to the spectrum of G gamification you know you put then somebody wants to keep on going back because wants to become want wants to master the installation but then if it's gamification you need reward you know way if it's a like a guitar like then it's a different conversation because then then you go to rules so then the surprise as such is planned so it's a different thing at least from what she's proposing so because that's a different thing that will be more gamification but she's speaking on is something that you they just happen in in that's why she she uses this words often of relation relationality is relation it is a this intrinsic relation between the the viewer participant uh and the artwork that is is happening and is in uh unfolding in time it's because is in time in in that time is that when the things are happening right yeah okay but I mean I was just wanted to mention that the of this still stands for our performance right it's it's on that spot unless we make an app that you know people can get it and you know download it and you know they can use it for forever no I think that's what I thought I wanted to share with you because I think it's I mean they just like they're quite precise from where the user certain words um but it's exactly what we're trying to do there they just G I guess they just really break it down in a in a paper in an article then then you see like the steps uh why why happens these yeah [Music] um but okay maybe so but maybe I can send it to you you have time you can maybe you just can read it because I have the book yeah let's see but is not the focus on this H but I guess no I wanted just to mention the the artificial intelligence now yeah I think I think it's it's a interesting approach and I think this this is something I've been thinking a lot since I'm in Japan because people like to create you know characters mascots about everything it's like full of physical manifestation actually something like maybe that sub be some could be something that we can use maybe from your experience there how people are living there be always I mean one thing I mean the call is ending but uh something I found super interesting is like people in Japan think robots are friends but in the western context robots are something you know like that destroys Humanity okay then uh so we wrap up here or is there anything you want to talk about yeah maybe this can be yeah let's come back on this like afterwards welcome back you didn't hear it okay welcome back can you hear me now yes okay I'll put my soup how was the chicken I still have some I I tried to eat half chicken that's the leftovers of the house but and this is my my oh these are my soups that will make my day oh well now I have the the like my body is the same as like yeah now I know I can't move but for me it's upside down so can I actually flip it yeah I can flip it yeah I don't know if the recording is also like in that order I mean it's side by side anyways I can fit into I know I can fit into your pocket I guess wait I guess I I also was telling you ah you are not the one who sent me so there is this happening politics of the machine politics of the [Music] machine I guess I start thinking on this because SE is is doing is creating one of the I think this is maybe this could be interesting maybe we can just jump around [Music] um so SE is creating one of the of the tracks of this thing okay that it happens every few years so apparently it's kind of yeah people say that is it's very relevant that cross point of science I guess specifically and Technology um there's a lot of [Music] nerds know tracks so the track the SE is and I think what they're doing which one is it track 11 yeah this one so they're doing the track 11 which I think is interesting uh they're doing the track 11 about death the grow and infinity yeah so about life what is and de found an interesting topic um so I guess I start thinking on grow F fin vud in the age of life like huh like how can AI die this kind of stuff or what yeah I think it's more like I see it more what what is the definition of what is alive basically but and you sent me a point I remember because I bought the book but I couldn't extend so much at some point uh how is called the name of this book of animacy you remember that book oh yeah animy like and there was a chapter like that was I think maybe we can start like I think that would be an interesting ankle for the for this thing of artificial intelligence we can go through that animacy book was called and you you remember you I can search because I know that it came in WhatsApp like if you type out in WhatsApp maybe because I remember you you said about something very specific on the book wait yeah I can search let's see no I did didn't found anything already missing my WhatsApp I remember Echo suggested that yeah it is an's but I don't know why I can't find it are you searching oh maybe I have to use my phone because it doesn't have the complete record yeah I couldn't find it in yeah oh gosh so funny me like I'm that time I was sending you photos from Santa Marta yeah like it was end of last year and I and I think I have the book actually in PDF yeah there is PDF and becoming human is this the one becoming human chapter open preview organs of [Music] war did you send me a chap I think did you send me a chapter no no that was a entire book I think cuz I know I remember about the book but I found now me organs oh the one who recommended this book she recommended us chapter 4 and six on the book becoming human all so you remember now so you do you remember you found the you found information you mean you mean the whole PDF I found it no if you I was asking uh yeah about the did I remember that somebody asked you about some chapters like oh yeah so that's that's chapter four and six I'll just copy it again how did you find I mean did you find it in the conversation or what yeah if I open it on my app I found it because on the web it doesn't have to full uh history but on my phone I had it and and the PDF is the whole book yeah but then if it's on the web you can't really see it so I have to maybe resend it now now it works it works it 312 pages so CTI book and I recommend chapter four of six maybe just copy paste the put it in the I'm put it guess in the yeah in the do I'll recommend of what was called any what uh what do we put there as link can you maybe just put the yeah I'll I'll try to like put it on my drive and then and then just L there the I'm so pissed off that the chip is not working always the links a chip they only work they only work if it's the document is yours no really I don't know yeah it's it's a bit weird yeah it's not it's not only work like the chips that not know like say for example a YouTube link cannot be achieved no uh no no that's oh there is Chip actually but it's like ugly but kind works it it's just like sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't and maybe takes some time to load it I don't know like for instance like in the the folder the monina folder link that is there because I put it there the link like it doesn't give me the possibility to make it a chip because I guess the document is from Will William is not mine oh you see here what I am so this oh I could make it a chip but this one no but then if I copy link wait I'm G to try I know okay yeah you're right it doesn't have a chip because it it should be yours yeah it should be yours yeah like guess it's because yeah it's Williams that's not that's not ours it's Williams folder which I think would be I mean I think we have to put this in in our folder because yeah what if he at some point one day he rais it yeah Modina is over and then everything is be delet okay so this is the book but so I guess what I'm mentioning here is that we can try to think about and that's why I was mentioning also the I think they're nice text in this already just text from what they proposed here in that link um [Music] um what is aliveness yeah live life aliveness yeah this thing animacy I think it's yeah this just to start proposing something like um because we were just like more like worried about like yeah okay so what artificial intelligence that like could be more that we can start doing like for from it will be easier from or I mean there's a different angle to do it yeah yeah totally makes sense yeah and and because also could be something that can grow in time like that's the way how I see it like I don't know how it will work with technology but if we start defining something doesn't is something that it should grow by in time yeah I mean it's like what if the what if the HD document it's an entity what if we can make a HDE from the hybrid document an entity what that will said it will say I my my I hate my existence this is such a mess what are you doing that will be interesting like what what really what will this document that we have will say about its own existence like yeah be interesting I used to put it here but we say it like maybe it really likes the way how we do it things could be F could be a fun exercise oh my gosh this has 47 Pages this is that it's a bad document bad document is it like in from the docent lives like in in human lives like in I mean in our societies and we I mean we value like to be healthy and skinny and so what about documents documents have to be they cannot be too skinny but also if they're too fat I mean but it come well it comes down to the content right what you eat yeah so I still maybe think like what if what if we are trying to do something I mean how to say this like as an excuse like I'm thinking that I'm still still with Modina like what if we are trying to we have a task I don't know there is a task we have to do something and there is a conflict I mean the the this uh third actor has a problem with it or there is something happening because of that say maybe we are trying to ride the Bible of best practices of let the Bible of like a manifest about the body and technology and or something or maybe to make bread or to make to cook soup or something and then the this third entity has a problem with it h I mean it should be something that the third person should come from different place from where we're from but I don't know I also think because like for January I want to put something I also want to work with something with unity I want to do something very simple but I want to create a landscape okay landscape um the the V heads it is I mean kind of I will start from that simple way because I know I I mean it's because I know also in terms of time and I don't need too much time to do it and I want to do it um but could become something else like what if that for instance like do give you space to you know like once you are in the VR headset then you are free somehow like what once if it's a landscape like a nice landscape um and the physical space where you are is not nice then you constantly maybe would like to be in that Spa in that virtual space I don't know I'm saying different things at the same time now but I think I'm going to go to sleep yeah but I think it's my lunch I I think we should have process but then like I was also thinking well or maybe I should say next time no I was thinking like what is it for you like we don't talk too much about like where we're from but like in Colombia how is is it and I mean in Japan I can you know expand a lot in this context of you know physical manifestation of the entity but like how is it for you is it something or not I mean to be honest that actually that could really give body to the like I mean from what I just know I know like in the East I think there is this um things how we perceive things in the in the west are is not the same there no like especially there is something with cartoons or something like I don't know like with things at house like I mean the differentiation between a person and objects I don't know this is something that I don't know too much but I know it's not the same how we separate things in the west or who we see things in the west um that's I mean I see in cartoons like often it happens in that you see like things are alive in the house and when you see it from a western perspective it looks almost like creepy because it's that why why the refrigerator will talk to you I mean that's that feels from it's not just it's not just like fiction like actually things talk to you really you have to make videos and show me like tell me like example I'll I'll find a video then yeah yeah yeah I'll find a video in Japan everything talks to you um yeah but then yeah but then I I don't know like I don't well then like going to Colombia like you know um I know that for example in the um like indigenous people like their culture like I I was with the aruo people and then they um it's it's not about a animism but for them like stones are really sacred they have to carry them from the ocean to the top of the mountain or something and I think that's really interesting you know how they are attached to an object this is interesting like that's something I would like to do like uh but what if I mean in a timeline I don't know like we do we could have start like somehow on your side and I mean I'm I'm talking about January basically because Al if we are smart then by January then we can have something ready to be Explorer in physical space with you and me in Slovenia because I have to show something at the end in the academy so that we work something towards January uh we can maybe base and maybe you can share with with me and we can investigate together a little bit of this animacy from the from your culture also since you still are there could be interesting we might want to buy something or do something about it um so it's the smart that you are still there and and then in the laps after February until I don't know when we can then do the coloman thing and also because I think I will try to go to Colombia because I because I'm crazy I need to see my family so like I need to haven't been there like in 12 years man so I need to go there I think I will try to take that I think I will try to go to Colombia makes sense and somehow in a way it makes sense in that period maybe I can talk to people and make it almost as a research and do something about it in that so there is there so there is a purpose there why to go there I mean you had a lot of purposes yeah I mean a part of like personal but then workwise within this work then we have something for August already you you see St line it makes some it makes sense somehow then we we can work like we can talk of this afterwards but we can work towards something in Japan that uh I mean we can feed us with this for February and then it start going into the the thing in Colombia I mean around this idea an see in in in back and for because I think also like now is super relevant in because of the artificial intelligence basically and a life and what is to be what is to be intelligent and all these things um yeah it seems exciting to me yeah I think that's a really good entry point I mean this idea that you proposed now I feel much better about you know working with AI well working with AI sounds like oh but it sounds really funny you have to show me I cannot imagine like so really things in ja like things stuck to you like yeah I'm I'm I'm looking for it I was I cannot imagine that you have to really show and also because then through that maybe also then we can propose some something with that framework and then I can I can propose it in Belgium to go to Japan um if I have the soon then I mean something clear in that we are in a phase where we are trying to we are working towards a performance uh yeah so it makes sense World Tour finally without artificial [Music] intelligence okay so I'll talk to you tomorrow and yeah have a good lunch yes help in my lunch", "E992uCyNXe0": "hello hello I just came back from the park from 10 minutes walk oh nice the best park yeah because I feel like oh yeah perfect because like I woke up super late then when I when yeah I mean the light will start disappearing I don't know one hour so yeah it feel that I was out yeah I was hanging out with a friend I mean during the day we went to a museum and then I don't know we went out I mean out of the museum around 5:00 p.m. and it was like completely dark so what time for you like here like at 5:00 P PM I think that we were there from like 2: to 5: or something it was that was long and then you know because in the museum you don't see daylight right and then we go outside and it's like we wanted to walk in the park I mean we did in the end but it was like really dark when we were at the park right anyways what if we start maybe just like what if we watch the video that you make yesterday ah yes so how do this let's just play it with how I do this share screen okay so let's start let me know if you don't hear the sound I think it works River run past Eve and Adams from swerve of shore to bend of bay I want the audience to experience to see that there's uh that everybody will interpret very differently the audience will give a different meaning everybody will do something differently slightly different from a clear pattern but regardless of if you open or not open the art work is there it's just there so we're just experimenting with the different mediums and that can be the video I mean in the video we try different things like drawing and you know like moving the body yeah can you show yeah yeah can you just keep the The Mouse and the timer then I can know ah yeah true I can maybe you bring it back before let then because I didn't pay attention to the change okay yeah so thanks sorry pattern regardless of if you open or not open the art work is there it's just there so we're just experimenting with the different mediums and that can be the video I mean in the video we tried different things like drawing and you know like moving hand or moving the body and also we made the composition of the video that's another medium and then you're we're adding the live person that's another thing um so I I think it's totally makes sense the short C Haas and core re Reed from North amorica on this side so so this is like the the circle know when we sit in a circle and no we talk about what happened the contemporary dance worship exactly yeah who was for you yeah solid rigid slow grounding always there continuous line modular pixel Block it's kind of boring kind of boring it's also like how choreographers are doing right like for example also you know like maybe with the space like PR BR um like their I don't know methods or technique that's about having dancers to experience something that they haven't experienced yet by defining the cube or um kinesphere or you know this kind of exactly yeah yeah yeah yeah bring us by a commodious vus of recirculation back to health castle and environs I think it's the Earth should be round isn't it like the Earth yeah like I mean that was that wasy theory years ago it was established the Earth is round um so I guess it's just a matter of scaling it's just like you are you are in a segment biert theor for over the short sea H pass because if you have a feedback you normally see something in the past right past yeah you can go in front you cannot go in the future you always can see the past but not the future is I mean what I found interesting of the future now that we're speaking is that it forc you to go to the magical spiritual sigal space it forc you to go to something that is not there so you have to make up something and convince me that it is the future the short C had passent core reared from from North aror I often do I see like two options very binary but this is it's yeah hope happens naturally yeah of course you know I mean can't you can't just you know come up with something new it's new because it has a reference is not it's just coming to existence just keep it so like I thought uh thanks for to put it together like I think it was like also super smart that you put the the the joys as a as a yeah I see just like I was pointing like now that I see it just like there's three moment if you go to minute one um like little there I guess so I I think it totally makes sense yeah go back like the beginning of that or not open the art work is there it's just there so we're just experimenting with the different mediums and that can be the video I mean in the video we tried different things like drawing and you know like moving hand or moving the body and also we made the composition of the video that's another medium and then you're we're adding the live person that's another thing um so I I think it totally makes sense okay we go to the minute 1:30 sit in a circle and no we talk about what happened the contemporary dance work exactly yeah go back to like the beginning of this please so so this is like the the circle you know when he sit in a circle and no we talk about what happened the contemporary dance workship exactly yeah who was it for you yeah who was it for you solid rigid slow ground so I think uh I think this maybe we can skip the the previous one The Sur thing yeah yeah yeah it's like an inside joke yeah exactly I thought the same it's just something you and me would understand and and go maybe to the minute three right I'm just not the Amor for over the short sea how pass because if you have a feedback you normally see something in the past right past yeah you cannot go in front you cannot go in the future you always can see the past not the future is I mean what I found interesting of the future now that we're speaking is that it forc you to go to the magical spiritual sigal space it forc to go to something that is not there so you have to make up something and convince me that it is the future the shorts that's it no oh sorry I just continue at passent core reared from North aror I often do I see like two options very binary but that is it's yeah hope happens naturally yeah of course you know I mean can't you can't just you know come up with something new it's new because it has a reference it's not it's just come into existence yeah okay I don't know I was not completely sure about this but I also think is not yeah I yeah I feel the same like it's I thought this idea is nice but also doesn't really touch the the core of what we're talking about could be yeah and also because it's the last one you know also because the last last one initially I thought about putting the the Earth at the at the end it's kind of yeah that's funny yeah that's funny the I could do that again but also think I think also think it works that you put it that oh I don't know like because you're the one who's doing that so just go as you think maybe but you said like like you sent me a message about um audience my God I was so awake like I fall asleep at 8 in the morning that's not good you cannot do that I think else is very but the perspective from The View this that I said like I also think in works best when we took around Pathfinder from the perspective of P performers of viewers otherwise be that becomes a documentary no huh what what are you talking then is this that you were men that that I that I said like so that I think in general works best around yeah so the one we talk because I think but it's most of the time that we talk around because this is we spoke of this yesterday know that we said um so there are two perspectives that we are working here that is a bit now they're a bit intertwined and I think totally fine in the video like from the perspective of the performer or of the viewer so I think it's fine um yeah that was just that once it gets a bit out then it it becomes almost like the documentary so but in the wayo what I would suggest is Maybe but that we should talk we should watch and just like shortly like maybe just talk a little bit maybe something will come up maybe not uh but maybe we can watch the maybe we should we should watch the video like the the the Montage of oh yeah I just thought like other things I noticed in I thought it was the recording sorry because oh yeah stop I thought it was the recording I well I told about two things like one thing was like What if we use what we just talked about because you know it's like we're you know there are two layers now already because we're talking over the video that we so do we took over the video yeah but maybe I don't know I I'll I'll see what how it looks like but no maybe I wouldn't spend too much time on that the other thing I thought about is maybe it's nice to like take some moments you know like in the last days or like maybe last week we had some moments that we didn't talk like we were just reading or we were just writing or something like watching video and actually like two of us in Zoom call we just like silent and maybe we can use some of the that those things in the middle of the video just to have like a break because it's like actually could it's quite you know like linear like talking talking talking so I'll I'll experiment and then send it to you later yeah yeah but actually that makes sense yeah yeah okay so uh should we just watch it the this spage H I was thinking that the space is very different for each of them no yeah I mean it's a video but the space feels after a while it feels very different each I mean the the one to the left down is obviously very different but the three bodies they are in I mean they are in a space somewhere I was thinking about like labor way maybe because someone I talked to a few days ago Marie she said she's the one who said you know like which one you want to be and also she said the one uh with the one you were moving the hand it looks like a conductor and you know if you think about it then it feels like you know other bodies are moving according to you and it also looks like you know it's it's really like you do it really it's not easy but in a more like you know elegant way and for example the body's running around that's a lot of Labor more the body is in the background of of the one under to the right no not the background but my body and when you are like running around it feels like you know we are working for jge who's just moving the hand right okay the scale is different yeah the scale of movement the scale is really think like the scale of movement is different if it goes like from left up I mean you one can think like you know left the scale of move I mean the scale of it's just the hand up it goes into the arms then right uh up and down it goes into the whole body yeah I would even say like the one under the one in the open field it it uses more space actually which is funny because I thought how much space like at some point is is I felt that the bodies to the right they kind of synchronize the amount of space that they will use because both are moving their body in the space and at the beginning is not it's quite different the difference I mean it's quite different the distance between the two of them but at some point they sink because because the the one under to the right it will use more space normally like it's almost like you're running yeah like you use a lot of the space while I'm not using that much space um but then at some point it feels that there sink like so there is not too much space or at least that's the the feeling interesting what space maybe it kind of you know the the timing really limits your body to move in a specific way the timing you have to like keep moving according to the instruction from Pathfinder so you can't just go like really wild right no already you're waiting when you move or when you move already you're waiting in your head before I I mean I guess I will set is like that in my head though if I move from one from one command to the other one before I'm arriving I mean I know I'm projected into the future like true like yeah I guess partially maybe that's why also you won't spend that much energy or you won't use that much space you know that you're are confined to a space and then when you're arrived somewhere you're are supposed to go go somewhere else so for instance like being standing in your head like being standing in hand stands it's not easy if you have to react to a to a movement that goes after yeah your movements your movements are cons they follow that I mean they go in in sequence no so you have to make it easy for yourself right yeah because also like you have to see where it goes and then you can move because you can't just you can't just react to the Next Movement Like You have to really see how far it goes right you don't if the dot starts moving this way you don't know if it's goes this way or like that's just here I mean you could kind of guess from the speed but you really have to see how far it goes and then you can react to it but it's imp imperfect no like because the Comm I mean it's there is this imperfection that you have So the instructions are quite clear like what we're seeing and you and me we are seeing the same thing but the way how we interpret like it's I mean how we interpret the space is not the same like right it's very different like when even when there is just one movement in in a greed if it's just one block that block it it in fact is something different for you than for me the I mean the we take the decision to make it how big is the step right so the one under run more it will run more but at some point also I feel that they are kind of sync I don't know if it's the amount of space that they're using or is the quality of movement because also there's a different quality of movement between the one up and [Music] down just like run it again I mean also the drawing it never like goes to the same path right and I was not so in the drawing I was not looking at the notebook I was just staring at the screen and just let a hand move without looking at it and also we never marked the floor or the ground I I was thinking that it's funny that there is more Precision like the one in the I mean with the hands there is more Precision but it's not so it's almost feels that that like if it's exact but I mean the drawings are not the lines are not straight you know but it has this feeling of it's um yeah is I well said it's close to perfect of the execution of comparing to the other ones um um but I think it's because it has to be with the scale I mean there are less things that they can go off the pattern you know like now the focus is in the hands and the like the the the medium is there like the hands in the pestillo the pen and the paper so there are just this factors where the score happens when the movement happens is only there but in the bodies everybody has yeah two legs two arms the whole body the more movement you allow the more uh nuances will happen the more chaos will appear like the one to the left under it looks so it has less Poss possible factors to go chaotic so although so it gives this it gives the sense of perfect lines almost like perfect lines like a perfect geometry when when in fact I mean the lines like I guess if you go really in depth like you can see you're not using a rule like you know it's just you're doing follow you're not even watching the the Sketchbook you are just following the the movement score with your hand can you go back like the bit to see to see the ones yeah like just maybe there yeah I think like here we are kind of like Sy I in the ones to the right the but there is something of the space there is something of the space because you are using way more space but when you said it it's funny that like when we have small movements maybe like one or two in the grid I think we do it in a similar way but if it goes like a lot more like four or five dots I think I tend to move further I that's I mean that's that's that's good that you said because I mean now than why it makes sense now now that you're saying like Okay it makes sense but this is you see this is about interpretation how you interpret is about interpretation of the space how how you will interpret the same movement in the G space from left to right when there is three blocks I will interpret very different and when you were moving same as when I was drawing you didn't see the space right because I mean or is it you when you were watching in the VR headset you were not seeing like didn't have pass through or did you have something yeah I have pass through yeah okay but still like we don't I mean you know it don't have a complete sense of space right I don't know how it was for you never thought about it actually it doesn't feel so I didn't feel about no I don't think it doesn't feel wait no it feel like a video in front of me doesn't feel much like it's different at some point but I did not did it there like I I put it in a 360 and then it changes because it's that I wrap it basically and then it changes my my motion becom comes differently but can you go back again like to to one we bit yeah but I think there is something interesting in terms of of of the intention because maybe that's why that's how I feel that when I said that we are in sync like it's not completely that we are in sync because there are many factors we did not Define like like for instance how how yeah the space how big is the space like all these nuances but there is some uh I think property in the movement like yeah I guess has to be with intentionality like intention is there like you know maybe because it's clear the command that now the dot moves now it's moving now it's moving so like the body follows in that fashion so it almost gets this quality of movement that is somehow similar for both bodies but it is interpreted differently right and anyways we have different bodies yeah yeah okay but I think yeah maybe just we if you find something maybe interesting of what we said here maybe maybe not let's see yeah did you show that so that I update my documentation so now it's kind of clean like the documentation Port did you guys have to use that that platform called sanity when do your thing no but the one that uh you were like the the wiki thing right I mean it used to be the wiki yeah yeah yeah now it's called sanity yeah it used to be a so you didn't guys you didn't use no I think they use the new one now for the Academy which as in a way sucks because like the platform is is the everything is open so basically if I want to go through your project and change something I can change it oh you know all the projects are open it's like a like when you have editor editor permission is editor permission for everyone okay that's weird so um because I check I check yours is there but did you check it yeah I'm just checking now I can I just like summarize fast I can of just summarize fast what what it summarize fast like the pro I mean yeah like the I document what what I right now sorry I I didn't get it I mean I just shareed the screen of I mean we talking about this one right I mean this is from yeah yeah but but so they check the the project M project yeah did did you saw that this one yeah yeah so I just summarize like thing I mean I just put like in short what where am I and I think that helped me to clarify some things and I was thinking also because you mentioned one of the communication the last week to somehow like to share this but I think maybe I don't know how I will mention it but I will not like show it because I think it changes the you mean the document the hybrid document yeah you were mentioned about the hybrid document yes yeah yeah well I think it yeah I think I won't show it yeah to me either way is fine think here then I basically I just said I mean that's how the process go know like if you go that it I start with some something that I adjust then I start working with with these actions that were about like time and space and then that give me the idea to go back to the sigil right and then we start and then Pathfinder appears visual Pathfinder it's a small thing but I think it oh yes you have all the videos I think it's nice if you can also mention Rafa here because um yeah like in a way like in like how it looks like in M's uh page like Rafael is like kind of consultant but I think rafhael really like developed you know the way we do the workshop I mean we do the like following the dot or following the line it really came from his idea so that'll be nice I think can you can you send me the the link of Rafael or something public of Rafael and we have to come back to the conversation yeah okay so I'll come back in a minute okay same thing yeah so that should be now I think I did yeah if it's well sometimes that takes some minutes oh where is oh yeah I see it now can you click and you click and you open the thing yeah okay cool yeah yeah not totally totally yes yes great cheing on labor but is it like is it like web editor they have or like how does it work is this and actually I guess you should have access to that like like I know you have to create an account I guess you have to create an account but maybe I just I just send you now like the document that I have doent [Music] me yeah check it out oh cool ex wait just open yeah but I think I need a invitation yeah account I think I mean you know I can write to Katie yeah she the one if I'm desperate yeah I can just ask her and I think she's more than happy to to it yeah yeah yeah okay no but uh yeah okay cool you know what it is um okay going back to here so where were you yesterday practical wrer time no I guess tomorrow in the space I will check and I'll have to move some stuff make Talk video so we are working on this you send me the Pathfinder I was thinking also that I see but maybe that the five minutes is nice also like of the me of of the the video like so I have to choose if to put it of three minutes or five minutes I have to see but I was thinking now that we did it thing is like you pass a threshold you know at some point you feel that it's long you know I guess from Once you understand ah this is going to be for while then you feel this is boring um but once you pass I mean it forces you to it forces you so you see something and after a while you think you understand a pattern something is happening so in your head you are like okay this is I get it now what you get like this I guess because the way we live we are very impatient no so like okay I want the next the next next now now now now but once if you are if you stay if you're forced to stay there you need I mean new things start happening so in you I guess after minute one two I guess then I start seeing the things differently then I because I have more time yeah maybe this perhaps like check what I said because maybe it could be interesting I was thinking that like like this what I said about maybe it could be interesting to said in the video like that it looks boring I mean what I just said before yeah what I just mentioned right I could just use that I think yeah like because that's like I think that's interesting I mean that's what is happening yeah that is yeah yeah that just you have to set the people to chill out it's fine and I think that's a matter of that that's why this is important in the or the score what did I put this is what is this from today yes which concep yeah this is from today oh W okay this is this [Music] um yeah breakdown score yeah I I have to write down like that that for like for the beginning you said like there will be a five minutes video or two times five minutes video the people from the beginning they know so they're not surprised no they know that so this is this is to like low down expectations like yes especially I think especially in this in this technological Frameworks is very important I think that's I think that's the just the best Quee ever like I don't we I think we should see that more often how to say this I think it's good yesterday you said like maybe it's not about to say what they are not going to see right what they're not going to see but to say like what what is going to happen right and just being honest with that I say like it might I mean you know if you know there some things that sometimes are not working then find ways or directly or poetically to engage it in the work but not just hope for the best and then just because it's not good I think especially with technology there's so much expectation in terms of entertainment because we here we deal with entertaining I think that's that I think this is maybe an interesting point like in Ting somehow like entertaining is not it's not necessar like I mean it's not passive like you know if it's not like watching a movie on Sundays that you relax uh it depends on what are but one can argue that it's something that Demands a certain it demands immediacy right it demands an exercise like what we spoke they respond or like react it demands like this exercise of immediacy of like getting lost in the space and give oh yeah getting lost in the space like getting trying to get lost with the artwork and so on while the technology so far the wayo always given to us I mean it's just starting from TV radio is always has been like used to entertain so if you put together these two of like the like the Arts and then the technology like people are very used to as audience we are used to be entertained they have to give us something that is entertaining yeah as a passive viewer kind of yeah yeah right break down the score till what's going to happen where are we wait I'm a bit lost Escape perspective you [Music] saying oh man I'm gonna I'm gonna race this I'm gonna take this down like this thing is driving me crazy the the calendar the time I was just looking at it I was like oh where's a Phil Le it's supposed to be in today have to jump on that's crazy keep it there I don't know like um what is question but no this is not cour is lies yeah I guess I need to I want to work I guess on this score like to work on the slides oh wait there was something that we didn't mention yesterday what's that about why I don't know what do I put my notes to do make why is this their mind looks kind of I don't understand not about the content but giving more questions like you see here what I am in the Todo yes it's not about I guess that was before because you I mean you're working in the video so I don't know why was that there I guess it was just the notes I took in order to edit the video oh okay okay okay okay so you can just delete them because now we have video I mean and I have my new notes in down below so I know what I did I did I did no h how is that I do this like this yes just keep it like this for now and but this actually is something that maybe I would like to use this sentence in presentation [Music] score score I mean this is kind of I don't know this is no that for me I think like there are some points maybe maybe not all of them they should be there but that in the presentation the way how the people understand um that's what it said which conceptual elements are important to clarify in this score for the open house that's why I brought I put this down the one that you mentioned okay yeah yeah so it's not about cont with medium it's something that to be clarified yeah clarify but that's why I put them there because so far like there is this I mean I just this is just something that it might be possible but maybe not depends like the so far in the score how we propose it that is not there so if there is not if there is not a clear way to say this I might not even say it you mean the medium any any of that's what I said that these are possible I mean I I wish I wish there things that that were that were understood right I mean that's something that we talk about in our chat yeah i' like I wish this that could be is will be understood um yeah yeah then but maybe that's something like get really important that what is the thing we want to deliver because if it's like you know even it's like 20 minute presentation you have to really narrow down what you want to deliver right I mean proba that's what you're saying like we have we can't just put everything there right no and in the way like I mean I think that we just decide this how this why now it's a bit of a mess here but it's is I think we can follow like how you propose it and then I think yeah I think we can put the timeline like copy it to the top so we can start editing it instead of like always going down so I think yeah but I think I will yeah and because also I put this objective subjective is not helping all anything right now he's just making this more crazy but um okay but let me just do that right now and then I just clean this what yeah and then wow this thing [Music] thing Chad presentation SC okay so need to put the time Modina timeline down below yeah at least below the whole this whole yeah I'll just but oh no I can't copy it why it's so weird can I move it maybe so weird score oh I have chicken I will put some chicken in the oven where I have some chicken yesterday I went to the to the shop okay and like in in Belgium also we have these things this things where like roer when you see this chickens are rotating right yeah yeah but I didn't know I mean here they also have pork and ribs and I was like oh wow I was like I bought pork and chicken at the same time I was so I was stuned by the I mean you could have chicken and pork in the same place oh like they're they're like roasty roasted they were roast they were having the chicken but also big and also ribs and I was oh so I bought pork that I think I still feel it from yesterday and also bought chicken I bought B wow take away this thing is no subjective yes take away that no objective subject to short [Music] intro yeah I just G to take this away because it's just confusing right now so it's your intro text color he let's colors short intro so this is text this a script your speech this the speech no to reveal but F of [Music] theion that's the video yeah just cut everything like you just put the YouTube there like or I don't know yeah do it gets messy if we both started he by the way I update my name in YouTube I was so proud yeah I know this and then I was like I know I thought like oh maybe I have to edit all the videos but it automatically changed automatically yeah that's great I also I also thought the same like he a pointer what do you mean yeah because I thought you have to do the same yeah like pointer to your account not the not the text as the name ah so he's a pointer to my account yeah yeah yeah that makes sense because otherwise I don't know like we have like 200 videos if we add chat and practice but there are many videos that like that you I don't know from when you did you start using my tag name right at first I didn't do it yeah yeah it's it's more recent I think so I think at some point you have to do it all of them oh to make it coherent like to have to make a video you know like your punish like with when kids have to grite like 200 times one thing as a child you have to do the same like there are 200 videos it title 200 times maybe like 100 times wait so but this I will say put like this I I think I from this I will decide I don't know when if I do it because I think yeah this is not to discuss right now maybe but uh yeah I have to decide like it depends how I feel the people you know like my I think it's good the people by themselves that give them time also like that should be in this in the in the short intro should be clarified there will be a video you know like this is what it will happen thanks thanks for everybody here uh this is what it will I will share some insight with you of my time here what I'm being interested in working on these topics uh I'll show you two videos and two exercises and I mean just uh and then at the end we will all together move up do will move up in the space and that's it and then it just clarify and then everybody is in the same page yeah um so this I will see maybe if I decided to wait until they finish the whole video and then talk about it or just from the minute number three or the last minute maybe start just mentioning some things for them to think by themselves but not to give not to speak out loud because if they speak out loud then I lose time control I don't know right right especially especially right now that we don't know how is this um yeah so this actually is part of the same thing but this actually is kind of like an in of this this we don't have to do it like this right [Music] now or talking about experience by not saying what we see this is done what if all the audience members follow our chat I was thinking Al like then the magic is gone funny like that so yeah also because I also posted in my Facebook something I don't know what um so so a short intro if you watching pretend you don't know you're watching I don't think no one's watching this but SC script uh so Z to two two minutes of the speech they will change the world then um then from two to five for I will say from two [Music] to from two to eight yeah from two to eight the video and the Talk N questions [Music] questions yeah the video and the the invitation to think about what is happening yeah I mean it's going to be a bit shorter if you don't ask I think I mean if you just asking questions I think that's quite short like just one minute yeah actually could even could be just five if if I just use the time of the video it will be just five minutes yeah well I mean it doesn't matter right now like it's one minute more so like following this then it's uh 8 to 12 and also you can make the video doesn't have the video can be even you know like can put 30 seconds absolutely in that video it's totally fine I think I would say maximum don't make it five minutes maybe like let's try maximum to give it to to to five if you have to but doesn't have to 4 z z z I don't know I get OCD yeah I know you're trying you'll try so he's finding something that it doesn't I know interacting with audience then 12 okay so and after the video after the video then there is um I I will ask one person that I think I will tell the coming days they should be fine to use the headset yeah that will take probably four minutes yeah could take five minutes four minutes five minutes even if it's like 3 minute thingy yeah that will take yeah the video is three minutes and it's uploaded in my headset but it will take it could take four or five minutes I mean yes what w pfinder together is it wait I have one question the no but it's fine like the the the the Pathfinder the sync version of Pathfinder is is it always doing the same is a is a random seat the which one the sink one sink ver is doing same thing always over because I feel that it's is not going really out you know it stays a lot in the center no yeah I noticed like the reason why it happens is because it's meant for the complete version with like lines and the problem with the lines is that if the dot goes too far in the grid line will exceed the boundary oh yeah yeah yeah it's actually like constrained in like really small space I noticed yeah yeah I see now that you're saying but the but anyway I think I will just use the the video and I have videos of yeah Pathfinder so I guess yeah it get easier for now I put the slides then I can then I will see it in the in the order what by finder together and then this like doing with you in Japan I think that that I don't know how may how you see to do this but might be a bit we don't have to do I I thought about this that oh yeah because I I wrote it like this right like recorded so oh I was thinking like like I don't know if you saw I mean you know I I remember like Ki was doing this uh you know there's like a studio in Singapore and he's you know performing in Germany and he's like trying to call them and there's even like this like you know like video buffering like you know like disconnection and this like this spinning wheel happening in in the show but it's all scripted obviously because it's going to be like you know 3:00 a.m. in Singapore or something if you think about it no I didn't so it but yeah that's that's yeah anyways so we could also do that we could they they have some kind of conversation you know like you would ask you know n how are you you know how is it and I I would answer something but it's recorded I mean I don't know if you to do it or not that could be funny but could be funny could be but it's really hard to synchronize because the thing is that we have [Music] to so the idea is then you do this together with us yeah I mean I could also make a video of me you know like maybe I talk first a little bit and then it switches to Pathfinders like full screen Pathfinder and I'm in the corner for example right and then then you just have to play that video yeah we could but we could like we could try to do that like but I mean let's keep it open like and because then we will have to record this we have to Stage this and then we have to time we have to time it to do it properly in the space then we just do it like this like hey now so this is in Japan right now like what time is for you and I mean we have to script something yeah but that's that could be fun because it's before yeah and I think I think even if you know it's obviously scripted I think it's funny no that's why I mean I think even like that should be like like the that should be obvious like that this could be something because it's the last part so yeah so this should be I think it should be we should play with this idea yeah of so yeah like to do something uh I mean what I like from this idea is that that because I was thinking to reinforce to reinforce something of the beginning like uh some message from the beginning um how to say that like yeah yeah I don't know with the maybe we have to do something or maybe not of this [Music] sot um like I would like because in the beginning I think I would like to start like with a question so I mean almost like in a classical way how you will present something so so that and also break it down in a clear way that people understand from the beginning um but to be honest I think so because this about like a research like a I mean like an academic research or or something that I think also thinking maybe we can do transform this into a paper or like like almost like following like a regular path when you you're clear when we are very clear that's the way who I see it at the beginning and helping the people and all and so on but like ideally actually this should be um for the people to understand that we have to build this together I mean that the presentation must be there I mean that the people are that the the I'm there so much for there for they as much as they are for me like like mean that it's not it's not a lecture in that sense I will agree completely with you it's not a lecture I'm not lecturing in something that I know this are is a research and this only possible in a exchange process that is very certain right I I think that's kind of like the the the in a way like what I what I really would like the people to go with is that it's a process where the audience are in in a that in an active State basically and they are exchanging is yeah the audience are in an active state so following that idea of thought oh and also I think I might say something that I think that I was quite clear in what I said just [Music] now what did I say it okay is in the recording the exchange with the I don't know what was the word not commitment but wait so actually this is two points take yeah like take and this is uh how to call this like what is this I mean like one so one position is about an academic take or like a research take something like this um and the other one what would you call it if one is acad I mean maybe it's another word but it is I mean I guess like what I'm trying to do somehow for my understanding is make it as much as possible I can mic or like uh structure as possible or clear as possible I don't know if it's academic that is needed here but well I mean because it one can say that one will be close to a method or like scientific method or a method to follow like then I mean that's why we following certain steps in certain order um that's what I mentioned is like as an academic but it's just it follows a method that that it has been established before us and the other one will be close to more I guess humanities right yeah it's like the second one is more it's open-ended the the first one in the first one is it's an statement somehow like that's what I I mentioned that it's an academic take or it's a scientific take the first one is a an approach yeah following a [Music] methodology it tries to be clear yeah it attempts to be clear and the second one is more close to Humanities which I I mean I'm kind of I'm happy with the second how I mentioned the second [Music] humanties Performing Arts and the first but yeah how to mention on the first one like but make a differentiation between Humanities and this is not this is not like technos science n set we just maybe be here like CFI and then just say that this is scientific said um we dance doctors um doesn't have to be too complicated like guess no yeah it's more yeah I will say I guess it just helps when I say academic take or is the same to say it tries to take that position no but academic also give you humanties [Music] yes yeah I don't know I mean I'm not good at this like to make kind of statements so I can't really give a advice I I always kind of avoid this kind of statement but I know that some in some cases it's really beneficial to start like that because I guess it's just what I want is like to try to that's because this is about intention maybe the statement is not the word but this is just the intention like the intention with the like to help to situate yourself right like I'll put it to slash apply it I need to find a way but maybe I'm not going to solve it right now apply it that's I mean this comes from technology no [Music] technology yeah but it's true like they have no clue and they are going to see I don't know four or five things right on that day in a think Academy yeah so it does really help if you could I think so I I think like that will be I would like and I think my battery is so my computer it's amazing I'm so proud of this computer it's for now it should be already old and it's my batter is oh wow and I realize also that I still because I can put four screens together because of the US like like like I mean I'm big screens you know like big project I tried at this at the at Academy also to see how the computer was after while really does it so good I'm Happ with the computer I don't know why I mentioned this uh no go back to what were saying no I think will be useful especially I mean I think it's something that I would like to do I think in that space makes sense not like to it's helping the people basically this I mean somehow is yeah it's helping to to to that yeah it's no way trying to be in clear as much as possible I mean I think that's yeah I would like that yeah I don't know like if it's the the way you would say it is to say that it's academic or just like you know break it down something into something simple that lay person can understand because if you say like it's academic then it's like oh I'm not interested in academic stuff kind of some people have you know hesitation like allergy to academic stuff but then but then you have the other option that is not academic I think it should be something anyway what whatever is like the worst the words that we decide to use it should be clear that is the other option you know basically I'm giving like an option like yeah exactly yeah and that's why like but then if you think about it I feel like this academic the word academic is really like Narrows down a lot I mean it doesn't really I mean academics can be any academic yeah but you know I think some people feel like it's like oh this this is difficult yeah but yeah I think we have to think about it like what how to situate this I mean it's it's hard because we are offering a lot of options but at the same time no because this is somehow I guess this is like the main thing like like from the beginning like I would like to say like the intention because this about the intention like the intention of sharing this is is is for this like that's the that's the whole the whole thing and it's very simple that uh that is just break down into that that like I think open-ended kind of work but I mean there should be other words that are easy for people to understand what is the point yeah yeah open-ended I don't know open-ended humanties open-ended academic take no I will say they even take this away and maybe like apply it this kind of makes more sense yeah true science I mean because also it's B basically because this is like in one hand is technology um and the other hand is perform is dance is performing Arts so is that but um in simple terms I mean this is just too abstract interdisciplinarity if if you said like if you mentioned at the beginning like just okay so the intention of the the the what I will share with you today is that you is about sharing technology yet about sharing dance thanks [Music] so but it is very much about that because I mean yeah technology it has all these qualities that we mentioned and then but could maybe could be work so yeah Technologies applied work with tech tech technology science uh dances open-ended chill okay have to come back on this not right now I guess but it should be a simple way like it should be a simple way to say this uh because it's just the clarity at the beginning like this is this is the contract this is the first moment I will say this is and we mentioned this at some point that I think uh borrow said this like the contract with the public is is the first opening movement of the of the piece of the dancer of in the stage so from from is that that contract is like from that moment the audience understand how they can be in the space um so this I would like that to be like that they can basically be between these two spaces so then is is and is neither so there is not only one answer but it's a constant negotiation between these two right negotiation right I mean other thing you could do is you know just say what you are working on I mean not just this project like your background where you come from true I was trying to boy to do that I mean I was just trying to say something sure but it might because people would judge or no just because I confusing I think I like it it's about technology dance but it's new what do you mean I mean if you say I mean we don't say it's academic but if it's academic it has to be new right it's not about just doing something others have done and we're doing something new it's really New Perspective into technology and dance and then it comes negotiation negociation yeah I think from here maybe I can take because I think it might it might actually work the if I mention I guess I'll then have to force myself like then to to present myself in a way that is Meaningful I don't know like yeah saying something basically saying the way how I work basically who I would like to work yeah it will give this context if I said that that's the I see Dan and technology or why I like from technology the fact that is concrete they somehow enclosed that is applied it serves it serves a clear purpose and what I like from dance the fact that is open-ended that helps to okay but can be can can be because David maybe that could be take out on a conversation like how's the way how's the way then maybe we can take that out in a conversation like uh how is the way that I work why I like that or but then this is about wait because that so the intention here is that the people understand so what I what I'm trying to do here in this intro is that the people understand that is neither um I'm trying to share two positions I'm trying to share POS like or experiences about technology and dance and the way who these two Fields inter they work together the way how I fuse both through my experiences right I think that's I should say like that's that was clear what did I say at least that there was a person thing would ah so stuck with that yeah yeah what I was trying at the exercise but I did was but I said like so the intention here is that to share with the people the way Hawaii work with dance and Technology the way who I share the way who I how I work with dance and technology is I I see it as a process there is in constant negotiation between two fields that they are different by Nature one being like dance being open-ended more close to uh the humanities and one yeah more open-ended more close to The Human Experience as such and the other being technology um close to [Music] um what technology actually spidery what is technology the application of scientific knowledge for practical purposes especially in Industry yes it's an apply technology is the development on scientific knowledge for practical purposes is an technology is applying is is an applied thing how to say that in words like technology like the purpose of technology has been historically to help humans to accomplish a task sure a problem solving yeah Dan and what that's one can I use that could be something fun attack I will say the other way around so the way I work in dance and things appro con to feel the difference Dance Tech where like where technology is prob solving where D is open-ended one even can argue that could be even problem making no okay this kind of work I have to put it somehow like this kind of work for now I I would say like opening questions well I I I I know opening up questions while takech is problem solving while take is problem solving so again wait so if this at beginning that what you're trying to say like when I try to say is I want to share the way who I approach working with technology from my back so I said like from where I'm come from so my background is in dance and in technology and what I will share is the way who I what I will be sharing today is the way who I how I work with technology basically between differ between difference between the fields okay this is fine for now this doesn't have to be it should be just really simple doesn't have to give me a stress that has to be super simple um but going back this the whole thing was because of the thing at the end that's the thing at the end like the funny thing the thing at the end like the the score of like the staging you and me doing with everybody dancing together right I mean this is the I'm trying to connect this I don't know if I'm making myself clear that's like I started speaking of here because this uh I mean that last point it gives space for that like uh you can it's just a stage that something has happened thanks to the technology we can even say literally thanks to technology like literally you can say that thanks to technology we are now with nuto in we are now we can now talk with Naro in Japan and then and then I just play the video although people can see if I play um no okay then I just have to because I was thinking just to mirror my screen but then I just extended uh I don't or just use OBS or something I don't know yeah just let's not comp no or whatever but [Music] then yeah yeah so but literally I can say like we can just like like play with that and break the magic it becomes a whole thing in itself like that thing to make um so I guess what I would propose then we can I guess this is not is is not a priority right now we have three days tomorrow until Wednesday to do this so we'll see um like worst case scenario I just propose to dance with everybody um I would like though to close underlining the same point of yeah something something that should be introduced in the beginning I would like to underline it at the end the interaction interaction with the audience right now talking about experience but not saying what we see we do this video is there tell one person from the audience do a demo with we are screen but so that's the scripted one right the volunteer yeah I will say let's try to do ITR um 13 till we can do this together could be some we'll see how many minuts oh yeah so no do it like watch pfinder alone just for one minute yes to see how to introduce that [Music] um watch by finder together revealing reveal the code the code like that could be interesting like that from the beginning you should like we should said that like everything is based on a on on on the code of pattern on there's a mystery like happening during that will happen uh and then at some point the mystery will be unveiling or like it will be um yeah like revealing the code because this is this is to say it for the people from the beginning like so this is going to happen um everything is based on a mystery code yeah because that I mean that's part I guess of the narrative you know like from the beginning you said like everything you'll see is based on mystery mystery code mystery algorith I don't know how to frame it but there will be a mystery introduced from the beginning maybe it could be just even that like it will be a mystery introduced from the beginning like there will be and uh and then Sol mystery revealing is three okay and do it with the audience now is the moment and then just you play I'm just playing with this like now is the moment to reveal the mystery which is not a mystery at all because I mean it's all the time is I mean it's it's not really a mystery already in the video you're saying I think that's kind of the funny thing that is not really a mystery I mean there's not something mysterious on that no and also people wouldn't really understand if they see the code like the video is the mystery but the code is like okay I mean some people might think oh this is the code but most of them like whatever mystery element yeah there's a yeah because that mystery is what it holds the people like you say like there is a mystery it's through the mystery that the videos are form or around every around this mystery is that that the yeah is there's a mystery element and then you reveal the mystery and then you can do the mystery together with with the people with the fake Call now that's another mystery who is now though okay but um yeah okay so this we just do this tomorrow I will I will put I start putting on the slides because then I will see start seeing how we'll move in time after so my homework is I'm going to update the video and also I'm going to make draft of the fake video call just to try it out can you try could you try maybe to say this part like trying your own words to say like this difference between these two things the intro I mean I could like try to sitting your own words like the like yeah that will be interesting if people understand like one takeway will be that they go understanding there is I mean we just talk about this yeah although you know as I said you know I'm probably not really good at it but you know if you just need my input I could do it yeah because I think you put it like maybe what what is in my head is is more complicated that it should be sure it should be something that is simple that it should be understood from the beginning is like because that's the intention of being in that space with with me is for them to approach it from two different angles so from the technology angle for for the applied angle and from the humanities angle so uh but neither of them and but in negotiation like I mean just what we spoke um yeah if you can just put in your words so you can something that that will that we can see something okay this is kind of no fun might be a disaster also but it will be fun also to see what happens it's I think it's it's fine as you said you know like we're putting energy in this and that's already something that people can enjoy yeah the whole point is yeah because if we say you know you just go on the stage and do like blah blah without much preparation then you know it's just that people wouldn't really I mean people might well prob appreciate but they wouldn't enjoy no that's I mean enjoy like I don't know how to say like they see that you didn't prepare but this even if you fail they see that you're prepared for yeah there's a nice there's a uh epic failing W look wait I need to send you this screenshot  document photo almost perfect I know you can see that yet you see it now almost perfect right yeah I have to stay still yeah what okay I didn't know I I had to stay still really funny um cool I and did you s like the thing that I I mentioned this Moco thing that is happening in utr oh is UT okay isut so yeah I know you sent me that yeah so I think like and that will be in then in January I think we have time to to just talk openly about if we want to like maybe to I think could be interesting to apply with what we're doing um I see also that in the board of of commission who is checking that is [Music] um Sara you know was her name s yeah and yeah it seems like a very interesting seems like a yeah I I see her name it seems an interesting thing and I think we are doing a good exercise and what we're doing right now I mean I like what I was hey I was checking this like the M3 thing this this board like did you yeah M5 this the one that you have is the M5 plus right uh M5 stack C+ plus yeah M5 ST stick and did you and you bought it with the with the with the wrist with the clock thing yeah like this one and I just realized that is so that's an sp32 esp32 yeah2 and so it has um it has a gyroscope also yeah it has IMU and wait practical because I was checking like did you can you check if you if you buy there like and if you buy one there with the clock how much will cost you if you buy it in China what's the The Wristband yeah I think it's like 20 bucks because here is like 50 and actually it's not easy to I mean you can buy the board but it's not easy to find the one with the I mean the the r thing that is the whole I I thought it's like the kit I can I can search um check and if you see something then just let me know and maybe if you if you can order then I just give you I just give you the money because I will see you let's see this development kit oh so development kit doesn't have the rist band H weird oh so it doesn't have the wristband oh okay now I got what you mean not easy what I found that did you bought it in a super in in a molder or what like a like Electronics District man I have to go to Japan like I'm getting jealous what the we really need to go to Japan we need to make an application where we argue that I have to be there I mean there definitely the like I'm pretty sure like we can argue that it is it is necessary for the world that I am there yeah totally yeah I mean I'm going to have a meeting with ycam people next week hopefully or or the week after so I will mention that um I don't think they have money to fly you but you know maybe they know someone well we have to try no because also I mean if if there is something if we if there is like the flight money I can get it from Belgium I think I see there's there's a grant for that but then I will need that invitation I guess yeah and they always want to work with motion bank I mean they kind of did it but they both like motion Bank wants to work with ycam and whitecam wants to work with motion Bank somehow but it's kind of like never happens oh maybe like once or twice they did but is it's weird I think there's like a lot of like miscommunication between them I should go as an ambassador of Goodwill exactly oh this guy he didn't cut the chicken man I have a full chicken without the whole thing really nice I mean at least it's cooked right yeah it's cooked so not that hard to cut it if it's raw then that's kind of okay I'm going to go to sleep um but yeah we do the homework what are the homeworks I have like a lot of homeworks now write the intro make the video call fake video call and then revision of the video Yeah fake the video call no no just draft I think it's good to do a draft just try it out yeah okay yeah good yeah and then we talk tomorrow yeah so have a nice chicken yes you too good night ciao", "wsjeRczd1uI": "River run past Eve and Adams from swerve of shore to bend of bay I want the audience to experience to see that there's uh that everybody will interpret very differently the audience will give a different meaning everybody will do something differently slightly different from a clear pattern but regardless of if you open or not open the art work is there it's just there so we're just experimenting with the different mediums and that can be the video I mean in the video we tried different things like drawing and you know like moving hand or moving the body and also we made the composition of the video that's another medium and then you're we're adding the live person that's another thing um so I I think it's totally makes sense the short C Haas and core re Reed from North amorica on this side so so this is like the the circle know when we sit in a circle and no we talk about what happened the contemporary dance exactly yeah what was phot you yeah solid rigid slow grounding always there continuous line modular pixel block kind of Bor kind of boring it's also like how choreographers are doing right like for example also you know like maybe with the space like P around um like their I don't know methods or technique that's about about having dancers to experience something that they haven't experienced yet by defining the cube or um kinesphere or you know this kind of exactly yeah exctly yeah yeah bring us by a commodious vus of recirculation back to health castle and Environ I think it's the Earth should be round isn't it like the Earth yeah like I mean that was that wasy theory years ago it was established the Earth is round um so I guess it's just a matter of scaling it's just like you are you are in a segment biert the Amor for over the short sea H pass because if you have a feedback you normally see something in the past right past yeah you can go in front you cannot go in the future you always can see the past but not the future is I mean what I found interesting of the future now that we're speaking is that it forc you to go to the magical spiritual sigal space it force you to go to something that is not there so you have to make up something and convince me that it is the future the short SE had pass and core reared from North aror I often do I see like two options very binary but this is it's yeah hope happens naturally yeah of course you know I mean can't you can't just you know come up with something new it's new because this has a reference is not it's just come to existence", "zIuGy4SZaKI": "yep did you bought the sweater yes I bought it today it's really nice at geometries yeah it's really funny right it was like 10 bucks yeah what really it was like 10 bucks actually much less if you think about currency yeah why so cheap I don't know they sell it like they say it's like 20 bucks but then they had some kind of weird discount they were discounting the one the sweater with some patterns I don't know why that's something I thought people would want but it seems It's not people don't want like people I don't see too many people using the sweater so sweater what is sweater actually and with how prices in if you compare to Germany to buy clothes like well I mean depends right I mean like has like say for reason hash do you have H&M there like H&M H&M uh I mean I've seen it before I think they still have it yeah I think they still have it yeah or these kind of things like will be the same yeah well actually like when you go to H&M they have price tag in different currencies right and yeah I mean I think it's a bit more like if you take into account the currency I think it's actually a bit pricier because the import here right somehow yeah okay yeah that's true but for example like uni is from here and you know I mean it's not like big as H&M but there are some stores in Europe and I think that's pricier compared to here right anyways so look what I made what is that you have a clock what is that M5 is like an Arduino what is that thing yeah yeah it's like M uh M5 stack it's like Arduino kind of thing but it's like everything is packaged um you don't have to have this whole thing like The Wristband thingy it's just like this little thing with battery inside so it actually runs uh without power and I made the Pathfinder inside yeah I saw it so but it's basically an so what what what did you put uh well the thing is what is what is what is the program what did you put inside like what are you using to run. code so I'm using Python and there's like web editor but also you can use Arduino IDE and compile it you know like you write in C or something and then you compile it if you have the live like you have to install the library for M5 stack but I didn't want to do that because it's just like if you use Rd ID I think it takes time to compile and upload the entire thing if you do python then it's much faster I mean to not not to run the code but to upload the code so I'm trying this first and I think it's nice to actually Learn Python because I I don't really use Python so often yeah that's because I was thinking also because the IDE I mean the idea of are do you know I mean is processing no C know I mean the the language is similar like to make the translation be easier I guess through it's I mean c both are based on C no yeah I mean it's just yeah I mean the ID is kind of the same but yeah uh our doing is C I mean it's it's a bit like C++ but I think it's actually like C with some C++ kind of feature like class you can use right but both use compilers yeah you have to use compiler yeah while python is not using a compiler or no it's like an interpreter and it's kind of more like it's more like JavaScript right like python will the same like right yeah yeah and this has an interpretor inside so you can run actually this is running python which is really cool I think I also what to do with this like what if we had like we should have like dancers doing like having this it looks pretty cool like as a watch looks very cool yeah wait I'm trying to run the the watch I made but the time is not correct because I just you know every time because this doesn't have a clock so it has to like connect to my phone to do the tethering to connect to the um to the internet somehow this doesn't connect to Wi-Fi at home I don't know why so I have to thing it has a Wi-Fi mod has Wi-Fi and W Wi-Fi and Bluetooth wow you what did you bought that H you bought that there or here yeah like in the electronic district and it was like in a keid I mean it's just this you know like they they come with this box but basically this is inside and then this wrist Bandon inside that's it and you have to Google how to use this because they don't have good documentation maybe it will be nice like when you come back like how much did you pay for that well that's a stupid thing I just noticed like I think I paid like 40 bucks or 50 bucks but if you buy directly from China you can get it for 20 bucks oh wow which is really stupid I found like I was like I should have checked it before but then you can I mean will be will be a difference if if you order from China then if I order here from China um I think it's just shipping that matters I think yeah could be because maybe we can do that and then I just transfer you that like maybe could I'm sure like we can maybe do something with it yeah or I mean we can talk on on that like in my because I think I aesthetically it's very nice yeah I like it because you know every time like I don't like electronic stuff so much because you know I'm I don't I don't have the you know sense of like actually figuring out how to pack package things that things work but this is already packaged so you know I just have to write the code yeah that's what I like because it's fin so you can just use it yeah yeah I like that this reand and it has extraer so yeah but it could be interesting like with this like upscaling scaling like if you because it's so small you know like thinking like at the beginning when we were thinking in Modina to do in in Slovenia because of the space was so big so you know like this is if this is a reduced version of I don't know like something like something could work in that direction because of upscaling right okay but let's uh go back to our business yeah here is C by the way is like minus four minus three oh yeah I mean here it's getting colder but you know not as cold as that should we go back to our homeworks I check it oh yeah I mean I don't I don't remember what was actually we said like homeworks ah the writing yeah yeah I already put it there you want to read yours maybe so like what what did we said we're going to do like to rewrite the wife of each other to try to explain the VR thing right to highlight that right because you didn't really that way my computer is like flying I don't know why oh like taking off yeah that she's very weird um yeah okay so go for it yeah so so the when I wrote um should I start with yours or no just yeah maybe that could be back so hor is why to help the audience to find new Aesthetics mediated experience of Time created between the artwork the artists the interface and the audience because the natural empath empathetic and embodied relation between dancer audience is partially ghost when using VR headsets through the proposal help the audience to find engagement new meanings and purpose when dance is mediated with digital environments like VR headsets in hope that engaging with the artwork creates a visceral sense of unfolding or Revelation but also a feeling of immediacy and loss and my version in dance a body is material either sculptural or atmospherical that inhabits the space in VR at a glance the body has a digital Avatar has more freedom compared to the physical dance it can expand transform and multiply and so on but in fact an avatar in digital space is figurative it is dis difficult for the viewer to feel the existence and have empathy this leads to a question how can we make a dance in a virtual environment that viewers feel the presence of the body one answer maybe to make more advanced VR with multim mobile feedback like htics spatial sound and so on another answer maybe to prepare ourselves as an observer with a physical body to be uploaded in the digital space and to open up new sensibilities that refers to what we do now with the dot right so I didn't get one part way this leads to a question this leads to a question but difficult to view or to feel existence existence and have empathy this leads to a question how can we make a dance neers environment that viewers feel the presence of the body yeah of the digital body I think one answer might be to make more advanced VR multitudinal feedback I mean that's like kind of like what yeah okay I get why you said that um and another answer might be to prepare ourselves as an observer with a physical body to be uploaded in digital space and to open up sensibilities okay so what you're saying this is like the this is like the I mean the typical or like the I say it's weird to say classical but this is like the the approach of like the from the night is of I mean to keep off giving more human feedback no that's more that approach not create more haptics more realistics that so follow technical like more more more more yeah so through human enhancement basically I I think it's technical part the second one is more I mean it depends on the perspective right yeah no but I think we just yeah technical yeah so it's like the classical approach of v in the 90s is what I was trying to say um I mean it's still the cas I mean research or maybe like startups you know there is this book like I think I told you that I I start reading and finish called the dawn of everything okay there there was greeting for this guy called Leon wa this guy Jon lanir you know like this guy is like a I think you should have seen in maybe some YouTube videos he's like a really uh really big guy fat guy with a long long dreadlocks and he was the one they said he was the one who I mean I think he the first BR uh that we got in the 90s was was his thing um and this book is is a journey between his personal experience also how he goes through that and also technical things he was he will throw sometimes um and I think like uh I recommend this to Anon when I saw him the last time in Cologne and he finishes and he was very I mean I was just mentioning this because he was mentioning like yeah a lot of of the that's what I will say like classical approach in the 9 is to to do this uh okay but okay cool I will just go through mine so why now to say that it is not about reducing us to data in terms of surveillance tracking or machine learning not finding a perfect social media so yeah so not finding a perfect uh version of oneself through data or like social media um instead bringing life to data emergence so the first part so yeah so Ault moves in a g space display what a DOT that moves in a GD space displayed in any kind of screen it's a binary process that the computer produ reproduces it is an inmutable code running in Loops when a person perceives and interacts with the image there are emerging processes in motion and the image becomes a Liv through the subjective experiences of a person and the second point was um it was more on the politics that was more touching the second part like I mean yeah it was more on politics like embodying the dot when a person becomes a DOT it's about simplifying existence a DOT it's inclusive there is no distinction between one dot or another in case I mean they could be different okay you see what I mean like that's was the point that didn't wanted to expand on that but I mean there is no difference between two dots two white dots of the same Dimension um there is no distinction between one dot or another when a person merges with technology via an interface it's data at its pure State there is no interpretation there is no intention of digitalization of a person so I mean I was trying to touch what you mentioned of the social media there and also the fact because I connect this actually with the work that I was doing with Joe that like the representation of this because we were working with DOT I mean with spheres in space was and it was building on that like that when you become a DOT then is then you lose any problem that you might have in society or I mean that you just become adult like you simplify Your Existence and you all all the people who are using these devices are now dots in the same space because you ex with other people other dots with other people but you you are just the dot so like like you bypass all the politics and they're inclusive in that sense so and this is was because we were trying to find why is the why we doing this I mean especially like that why is that I'm doing this in the way that I'm doing it for the seven right like that's I think that was the intention what that's what one my intention trying to find what is why that we want to do this because yeah I think I I maybe we can try to do something with your text and I mean there's one just one part that that I don't so it's clear in Dan body is materials cultural habits space viral reality at glance the body as a digital Avatar has more freedom it has it can expand transform and multiply but in fact an avatar it is in in a digital space is figurative in fact space I'm trying to think because how to because I think I perhaps like this can I like your because it's short but I'm thinking now that how then perhaps we could use parts of this and make it still more easy for like you say in a dance it can expand transform and multiply but in fact an avatar in digital space is figurative so basically here also you're saying that a [Music] person yeah I just a person that is it's not [Music] person somehow like like how to speak this is like the simplified version of that like when you when you're saying that and and and I like it for the text but to put it if there's people from on with different level like you're saying like in fact an avatar is not a person yeah yeah I mean you should just say it like that yeah a person is not a person yeah but maybe just copy paste because I think it's like just we can duplicate this don't change it completely what do you mean wait yeah I'll do this oh I see yeah I think it's good to take away we put it like as a as a in as a concept but then for somebody else or the public say yeah and then I take this away from here so in dance body's material sculpure atmospherica inhabits space Dan but is material or can't be a person maybe in Dan is body is material the body material material haveit in material that inhabit the space V at [Music] glans the body as a digital aor has more we um say that glance to different way at a glance like in first thought or right one thing one can say or like naive idea oh one idea just like one idea one idea is the is that inbr one idea is that inbr the body as a digital Avatar the body as a digital [Music] Avatar and what is an now what like how I just put it it's a good point aatar a man infestation is a graphical representation of a of a user of the user's character of persona that's tricky I will take that so fine man yeah but then I feel it goes in the circle somehow I mean but the thing is like the I mean in because I read that at some point when somewhere like in in VR you find I mean one whole thing is the social aspect and that takes the Avatar that's why in my research like in motion bank I didn't use the word Avatar because that com uh that entangles the social aspect of the experience I was using the word like graphical representation on models mcal models because they are flat they don't compain the Avatar implies somehow like a complex process of how much you identification somehow and how much you relate and but I mean in a in a simple way for somebody who has no idea an avatar is a representation of you in a virtual space right is a graphical representation of a Persona of of a person in the digital in the virtual environment yes but then in this context it becomes like that means almost like nothing because we're saying digital representation can oh maybe just that you know what body represented no well represented the representation no um as digital representation has more freedom no I think wait the body is one idea is that the body I will put in between I will put it here as in quote Mark just not confusing this yeah I mean because this is just something that I will said the body has the body Avatar as digital representation no so not here body as here the body as digital representation Avatar no so like this and then I decided if I say it or not the body as digital as one idea is one one idea is that in the the body as digital representation body as an avatar I think at the end I will go for the AAR but like so let's put it like this um because people everybody just speaks of this Avatar but just they're so confusing yeah but I think in that context because this is I mean this is this is a conversation for people really in depth in the subject like I was the last last the last week people w i mean people working even with this they don't give too much division of this like so B so I'm fine with e it that's no and also I mean I will let's just assume that the people who go there at least they know what is an avatar then I don't have to go into that yeah well I thought like what yeah I mean I think it's it's a small point is point right one point one idea is that the body has digital representation is that the body as a digital representation has more freedom so that it so it so that it can expand can transform and multiply transform in transform bigger scale smaller scale and multiply in different versions of itself but in fact an avatar cannot be a person it is difficult for the viewer to feel the existence and have empathy is difficult for the over the the audience audience it's difficult for the audience viewer to feel the existence to feel the insistence and have empathy is it for you feel the existence and have empathy this leads to a question how can we make a dance in a virtual environment that the audience feels we can put some question more like that was a question that I put somewhere what a what audience needs to be engaged with Dance with dance is mediated with digital environments what did you said here one how can we make a dance how can we make dance in a in Virtual environment how can how can we make a dance in in a virtual environment that the AL feels or can we make a dance in the virtual environments that the audience feels the presence of digital body okay we have to break down this a bit because it can to clarify it how can we make a dance in a virtual environment that the out audience feels the presence can I change this for this so that so wait no actually so that the audience feeli or can we make a dance in the virtual environment so that the audience feels the presence of a digital body that makes more sense for me because I have to say that out loud yeah sure how can we make a dance so so this actually this is this is important this is the whole kind of why I mean yeah yeah kind of yeah how can we make a dance in the virtual environment so the audience feels the presence of the digital body yeah this is kind of this is quite concrete was the other question that I have here what audience what audiences needs need to be engaged what we need to engage what engage yeah and what [Music] need look this we make what audiences need to be engaged wait what does it mean um what do what do audiences need what does the audience need because it's the it's about the audience right yeah this about the audience yeah what does the audience need when dance is meded with digital environments for what I think need in order to feel the presence of the visual body or is it just change it and then I read it wait for example what does the audience need when dance is mediated with digital environments feel like feel need for them to feel the presence of the digital body for example I mean then it it we can rephrase it because it it's like double redundant wait there two one is like how because I think there are two different things and I mean I think could be possible right now like one is how can we make a dance because this is about then is how as a field you know this is as a field how can we learn to make a dance like we everybody everybody involved in the field to make a dance um so the audience feels the presence of the digital body so so one is the question for the field but then the second question is about what is so I think this the second one is like a sub question of this first thing like what is the what is that the audience really needs but is we the first I will say this in general but then the second one I see it it could be is like it's really focus on the audience right but then I mean in the way formulated right now is not clear that yeah just need some kind of connector like yeah uh so okay how can we make a dance in Virtual environment so that the audience feels the presence of the digital body what does the audience need to achieve that um but it's like that right so what does the audience yeah yeah exactly that I mean I mean just now that so we have to change this yeah when Dan is made but they are pleas I mean they have to proposed what if we said this one could be what does the audience need to achieve to to create a visal sense of unfolding and Revelation but also feeling of iMed and loss this is a lot what does the audience need to find new Aesthetics well I think we should say like instead what is needed for the audience to I mean the first one is a little bit lengthy so it's hard to say but the second one for example you know what is needed for the audience to find new Aesthetics and just or or what makes the audience to feel find new Aesthetics no no no is needed need I think I like what is needed for the audience to find your athetics I think it's clear just that what yeah yeah what what I like from the the previous one but it's long is that it says like I mean that's what you want from the audience not like one is like that sense of like I mean when we we speak about the feeling is this visceral sense of something that happens in certain way oh like you mean like for I mean what I'm trying to like the way who I interpret this phrase is that to create visual sense of unfolding or Revelation is this is what basically we do in the way how we propose the score is is encrypted in certain way that uh wait then we have to come back in seconds let's do that first toilet yes can you hear me yes okay I was trying to rephrase it a little bit so I I wrote the second one what do we need from the audience so that they can find new Aesthetics what do we need from the audience so they can create a visual sense of unboarding of Revelation but also feeling of immed immed and loss need forence to it so what is needed for the audience to find Aesthetics what is needed what do we need from the audience what do we need from the audience so they can create a sense what do you mean what do they that what do we need from the audience I just made it more explicit I because I thought like you you you're you're say what you're saying was that is that um you need some kind of action from the audience in a way or like them to do something instead of like we provide something to the audience okay if I understood correctly no no no no no no I think what I was it wasn't the same what do we need from like no I mean I think what so what I was trying to say is that so like the the to saying that create a vis sense of unfolding and Revelation is that's basic that's the feeling no that's the feeling of of what what basically what we do uh when we speak in uh engaging the audience but not giving them everything in front that's why we don't show badf finder at the beginning so like you engage them with something and so is that balance the mystery and the anigma that they spoke in this text right so that's what I meant in that like the like so there's a visceral sense of unfolding one hand so or of unfolding because they keep on unfolding patterns through the they engage in something and slowly things start to reveal that's why they engage but it's a visual thing is a feeling they stay there because there is something there for but they feel that the things are happening and the but at the other hand also they are experiencing uh immediacy and loss because and this is related to perception because the if I understand correctly immediacy is is is related to the way I mean when you get lost when you get when the perception of your time and space when I think a good example of of immediacy is when you're appreciating a painting and then you get lost in in like you are you are immersed in the IM immediate moment so that your time space you don't see a painting anymore but you are in this embodied process so one can say this immedis SL uh embodiment loss is yeah okay so loss is something that like as a result of like this immersion you mean like yeah because you're lo I mean you're lost in in that immersion exactly okay because I thought it's not really clear like loss sounds like you know you actually lost something but it's you lost yourself more like could be also like but but I'm thinking that because this has I mean this is not so clear so like I will set even because I guess I will I will put a presentation that that could be a slide just in itself like because this a bit more complex to dive in like like maybe a first slide could be if they enter in the space that is just this big question before I say anything that is just uh how can we make dance in the virtual environment so the audience feels the presence of the digital body what is needed for the audience to find your Aesthetics point you know that could be like just a first thing that people see as a one thing the one is slide in the beginning and then I introduce and then this could be a second at some point I mean we decide I decide depending how how it moves if this is relevant or not like to put it because the ideas to not make it complicated but it is interesting like that's why we doing this exercise that we we need to find a balance where it still is interesting but also we we make it accessible as possible right um but yeah so okay let's like I will read it out loud in dance a body is a material it's a material that inhabits the space one idea is that in VR the body is a digital representation one can say it an avatar and it has more freedom it can expand uh transform in a bigger smaller space uh it can multiply but in fact an avatar can can but in a in fact an avatar cannot be a person cannot be a person it is difficult for the audience viewer to feel the existence and have a empathy this leads to a question how can we make a dance in a virtual environment so that that so that the audience feels the presence of the digital body and what is needed for the audience to find your Aesthetics I think this is clear I think I like it I think this this can be the intro um so moving on I was thinking like when I was in the toilet and I was thinking of you my pleasure I was thinking that I don't know wait let me try to to to to to say like if you can try to take a note somewhere like that say for instance like in if we follow like at some point somebody comes with a V I think it's important that somebody tries the BR in in there and it will do basically exactly what I'm doing in the video uh I mean the video that we show the four squares like at first glance if you I mean you what you perceive from I think I don't know as a is that basically why why is that happening I was thinking that so because what is happening is a person is doing in the space what we are doing in in a in a recording right right so the nobley of that I mean is that the person is in the space it's just it's just that so there is nothing more than is about exper is is this about the perception uh in ter or the I mean in this text we are defining in is speaking about the Aesthetics Define it as new aesthetic defined as mediated experience of Time created between the artbo the artist and the audience so what this what is novel of what is interesting of this because there is nothing more happening than just a person is repeating the same act that you're seeing in the video is that your experience a different medium in this case the person I mean the person becomes the medium if you compare like the v in the video is the video you right even though there's a person but in in the act of somebody is and I think then somehow I I would like try to underline that because I think that's important that the purpose of somebody using the VR is not just to repeating that but is is that you give basically you uh you change the medium to do the same but it's just I mean meaning the same uh or padfinder is just an excuse for yeah to show I don't know if I if in my did you get a beat what I'm saying or not yes I think so um yeah because it's really like I'm trying to like paraphrase but where like it's really not about it's really not about Pathfinder right here like it's no like it's just like a it's just there so we're just experimenting with the different mediums and that can be the video I mean in the video we tried different things like drawing and you know like moving hand or moving the body and also we made the composition of the video that's another medium and then you're we're adding the live person that's another thing um so I I think it totally makes sense and it's not about what we're doing actually just put yeah second and like regarding this like actually I just checked email from Rafael uh yeah he answered to us I mean it was really short email but he said um I'm glad that Pathfinder isn't ation to you and the video is a beautiful mix of Aesthetics yeah yeah that's something really usually put yeah actually yeah yeah I was actually very very happy when he says that because I'm kind of in this battle in my head like thinking I mean between like thinking like that what I'm doing is not enough because I'm not using enough technology somehow and then the like but in my head like what I'm doing is around like these ideas like that we just discussed here especially in terms of new Aesthetics because that's or novelty and this or understanding why is this relevant um so I was happy when he said when he mentioned that because for me the is it's it was about finding new Aesthetics right and it also like I had a conversation with with a friend of mine she's visiting here from Canada and when I showed her video she was saying that like she was looking at the video with the perspective that which person she wants to be in the video oh really what what what is this like these are your notes of today oh I just like I just written down what you said try V there to the same video PL finder why is that happening the space a person does what is in the recording now is that the person is in this space about perception aesthetic experience in this person underline the difference of meeting and video person not just repeating yeah um yeah so because the way we are proposing this it seems like we are just revealing I mean we follow what we said the last time how we propos it it's just at the end that pfer appears um okay no don't worry with this then I just I just do this myself and then but then okay just practically speaking um and then we can round up because it will be late for you B I see you there I'm I'm following okay but just practically speaking uh can you send me the video of B finder like of the I mean our video that is in YouTube can you send me the send me the F the that version and then maybe I can export it as a three minute version or I can just upload a three minute version no but just send me the original like okay I want to have it in in so that I'm not depending on the web right to put it on yeah you know just like to have it just send me the video you yeah and send me both like you know make that three minute version and the and send me both and then I just test them and then I time them I start timing the hoid fields yeah so I'm going to do like one minute three minute five minute just in case the video yeah yeah and then should I go and check I need to check I don't know if I will need a microphone is like 40 50 people should be enough to talk like without a microphone without the microphone yeah I mean if you talk loud I think it's I mean depends on the space right yeah but also I mean that space I think the echo I think is kind of okay I mean you can but I think maybe will be I mean just in case case like maybe it will be good to to talk them like there is in case that is not working this the sound there is the sound there I also means that I will have to I guess put I will show you once I'm there because make no sense right now here like the space where I am going to be I think um in the space and wait [Music] practical we didn't work in the personas but I don't think it's I think it's fine it's fine I think it's fine right now no I think for me it's fine I think I will just put a try to put let me check the show the video demo no explanation so at the beginning there was a short I I will I will do this I will do something with this to make it bit more clean again and um yeah cool no let's let's just come back to more on this um I'm happy like I just need to I think I would have be happy if we see it in the space and do it few times right and that's it um uh what what so Nuno proposed like to do some like to do that that we could do some like some paper like that was his intention no like to do some he sent some email and oh the research yeah yeah paper right I think it's a good idea I think it's totally a good because what we're doing right now my feeling now is like we are doing the opposite process that we are we are doing an opposite process that we have been doing with best practices like now we are really trying to we are trying we are trying to be from the point of view of the audience right which we never I mean at least at least that's my intention that's my intention and trying to stay there somehow um but I like it's like a design process in a way yeah because then I mean we have the practice and it still is there and we should I mean the practice is there is always there but then that's a language that just you and me we develop right and and I think this it has been so useful for my work for your work we we understand a lot from the interacting with technology because in the way how we work and I I think it's something that would be uh novel for the field um but then we need to find ways how to approach it communicate yeah how to communicate basically which it has been a conversation that we start when we say like about the workshop that this is not different right like and and now just it's nice because it's just how it seems that it's the place that life put us is like like so now we are in this in in for the Academy we have to do this in this way and that was a natural approach that came but also in the process that we are doing with Nuno is based on the interaction with the with audience um so I think it's yeah it didn't make sense somehow yeah I mean yeah let's see what comes out and I think um it will be helpful for everyone if we can put this into like a research paper yeah but again it depends on like what kind of angle we're looking at because they are specifically I mean not specifically but I think it will be something technical like in terms of contribution I mean I'm thinking like the we haven't been too in depth into this but I think like the like to start thinking of an interface like like to start developing or the conversations of of interaction for the AUD I mean to to have interaction because through an interaction also we could start uh gathering information like of how people interact right so that's why I think like we are doing now i i i p i see that what we're doing is still when presenting this information with the audience is about interaction but it's a it's not like like let's say digital interaction but there is interaction but right uh I'm assuming this is part of the same process and I'm thinking that maybe in that line like it can become something like um I thought I at some point I told you like maybe we can think of that for for January uh and how people can interact like even I mean meaning that even just like putting hearts like what you were doing in your performance you know like adding emojis or saying just um interacting certain ways right the performer can feel can perceive the the the the audience right but then I mean there is there should be like a distinction of are we working of for a performance you know like then it happens and entangles in time in in space or are we or is also an installation that happens without the performers so that I think there are two different things right I mean one thing I talked about with William some time ago was like we could also have kind of like a bit of both so that after the show people have like freedom to try it out so it becomes like a bit like installation should be like that yeah I think more like I remember something I saw in AR Electronica was very interesting but it was very complex also what you see from outside but you have the the chance to go and test it by yourself so you can get lost in I mean there's the sense of immediacy then you go there and also the people were there so they give you the time right so that's what I was I think I was kind of mentioning but of um in the 90s you have this culture of with technology of showcasing that oh yeah you mentioned before yeah yeah I think I see see something like this um what I'm what I'm thinking is that I think we need to find a way how present what we do um I believe like and I think I would like to get B more engaged and involved in in dramaturgy and in narratives I'm talking also like in a medium term now say for instance like now you going to go to taling um and then you will be in a process there for some years uh so I was thinking also I I don't know what I will do but then I'm thinking that I might have to since I have to fix my master thing problem before I jump into a PhD so I it means I might have to do a masters um so I'm thinking that and my this the dramaturgy aspect of the narrative thing I start seeing that it's very important in these processes um I start thinking that that could be something that might I might start following up so how to in a way keep the processes open enough that um I think not really that they can intertwine right like for instance like what we're doing now totally gives space like uh to I guess intertwine with taling if it this happened at some point the um and I think since we know the since we are in a nice environment I think we can make it somehow it floats um so because of that then I'm thinking that I believe that we need to find a way how to create or like way to perform this thing like um because this it's yeah it's we need to find somehow a way that is not completely out but also it's not completely compiling but it's in it's in between right [Music] um I'm just trying and I'm trying yeah I like I'm putting in the stage I think we should try to put in the stage um so one when I said about like the the showcasing is because with the word is I think showcasing is like they were just showing there's just very concrete things to show like this whole for instance like when you show me you know like when you when you have in your hand right know like it's something that is very clear and it's appealing so aesthetically is it has it has engineering or design approach right um but then we should find I think we could find a ways how [Music] to perform something with it like I don't know like now the way who I'm seeing this is like we're presenting something that is more close to our research and then through the research you start proposing something um that is important for the research research itself case in our case is for instance like to cl to find the way to for in the score to say to the audience like the the the the moment of the of the VR I think is very important for this presentation like in the sense of is in that moment or in that act that you said to the audience that you're just changing the medium you're not doing something that is spectacular you're not it's just because it's exactly the same that the people are are seen in the video but in person so that's that's The Narrative of that that's the the ter that's the that's the meaning thing um how them to find ways to play with this [Music] um yeah I don't know how to be in out of the narrative somehow you know like for instance if e or narrative is this is a research you know how within the how within the narrative or research from time to time you tell them but also it's a performance right so understand that some things that happening here as a choreographic score or something like how to find ways through the narrative that you propose that we propose to go in and out because that's what I think is in those points that the that the people can find new Aesthetics is not only what we are presenting but it's in in how we are doing it right and I think for this then we both have to help each other because we have different that's I think that's what I like very much of this process because then we can support each other in this and we need this back and forth yeah cuz like when you said it like I really I thought about the like the H was a it was a lecture that I gave uh two weeks ago with my cards so it was and I I kind of like framed it for myself as a performance was a lecture but um but it's not lecture performance so basically I decided you know I reveal a card and talk about it for like three minutes and then move on to another card so this already gives like a choreographic score although it's random but then what I do you told them at the beginning that you will do that did you told them I but I didn't really explain why like I didn't really explain why I have two cards why am I doing this but I just abruptly started like that and you know that was revealed you know as I do the process like I had to explain some of things but the way I thought was like yeah I kind of had the structure which is you know can be choreographic structure I mean choreographic score or dramaturgy but then you're kind of like you are like alive or like you know you are kind of free inside that space to do whatever you want so it's was you know it's a bit like the practice but you're still within kind of a like loose frame I think it has to be I I heard that from somebody like especially I think in this context like the expectations should be like minimum like you should I think like being honest in what you're doing maybe not in why you're doing because that becomes complicated before you do something you know if you start saying why you're going to do the things with the cards it will become very it's an abstract process it might be complicated so I think what is g to happen I think is is um is very important um especially with technology if the people come for instance to my my thing and the research is about virtual reality and dance and actually the title from the uh I don't know if you receive an invitation from the academy of yeah what did they say because I'm curious I don't receive that oh I actually don't remember if I saw the content yet wait what was when was it uh yeah invitation open house 8 uh sigio bringing the inner World out that's it yeah so horis is like I don't know like the this is this is a bit abstract now from the place that I am although I mean I make sense in my head but because like Pathfinder is sigil for me right now but I cannot and I won't I won't go in that place to explain that [Music] um maybe we can talk on this in the next days how I mean because the question Rises than then to have some answer um or options or option yeah but uh but I think it's important just like to uh in this in this Showcase in this uh Frameworks to help the audience with um with the expectations yeah because from the beginning you they tell like hey you're not going to see here a real engine five and Hyper realistic images chill out they will be like then people then it's it's up to the people what to do then they stay or they go and then it's fine I mean you don't even have to say that actually I mean that's the thing you know that's that's really the thing like there's no expectation because you just don't tell like what's going to happen I mean that's that's what what that's what I'm thinking like this is part of like or doing I'm I I'm thinking that um being honest uh or or being I will say it being clear because being clear and just saying what is happening as much as you can will help the people and and therefore they will help you right yeah I mean we have to figure out like in the next days like with the you know we to like run through and then we'll see like what is needed what is not needed but in general like I don't think it's good idea to say like what we don't do that also you know say it again repeat what you said that we what we don't do like you said you know we don't do unreal we don't do Unity not put it to not put put it in that we can discuss I mean I think this is something that could will come more in time that yeah yeah as we do it we will see and I think we should get more in that in that exercise of uh doing performances yeah even like we can trying together like do it like doing L of practices like uh yeah okay but yeah nice so I will clean I will I will for score I will kind of I will do score and star slides some slides you will send me the videos oh wow that we didn't talk of that but maybe we talk on that tomor of we need to make this video of of to talk about oh our experience maybe one of the things that is like yeah um I was thinking like we should just like edit some of the chats yeah but then I mean will you do that process like can you do that process let's see if I have energy maybe I I I I'll try at least I can't promise that I will maybe maybe something that so but what is the point of the of the video like so what would you like in the video to said like so I know for instance like I would like in the video that we express part like what I just told you about the that is not about the medium what no what that is not about the content yeah but the medium like the yeah yeah that like the content meaning like the fact that like the fact that is showing yeah that what I just told you you know like the fact that you're showing somebody in the space doing the same that they're seeing that's part of um but what you mentioned in your notes I think the video was more about what was your intention when you we have to come back for a second yeah I first thought about like interview but then like I think what makes sense I'll try to do something let's look like can you come back just shortly let's R out this okay okay yeah okay come on video score what is like [Music] this because that when it happens in in the score normally that video so there's a short introduction then there's this video after the the grid of videos right after that I know no then after that is ask around that's happening I think I will happen well well people are watching this and then we talk about what the experience of doing this action doing this exercise although we don't talk about what we are doing so this is the video but yeah so [Music] what so this was the video initially that was your idea initially no like to talk about Pathfinder without seeing Pathfinder right that was that what did you say again sorry like the your idea originally like when you proposed to record this four minutes of video of us was to talk about our experience while doing Pathfinder right yes was that right not about Pathfinder not that we are watching Pathfinder so what about our experience just keep it something abstract that you know it just disconnect I think it should be that that's I think that's what I'm I'm saying this is like is question here [Music] um do we want to just keep the conversation about the experience of doing what the people basically see because they just saw it right so our experience doing that or do we want also to allow other questions for instance like the like uh what I just told you about it's not about the content but about the medium yeah that's a different thing it brings that in a different place right so I don't this is kind of like you see what I mean yeah I totally agree and I think but I'm not saying that it's one or not it's more a question like do what do we want that's I'm asking no so this is the thing like I what I'm thinking is actually not about the content but it's a medium like this whole video of talking because it doesn't have to make sense but it just has to you know raise questions more questions okay okay okay okay okay yeah yeah yeah so the the video is not about the content of the video but it's about yeah I get the point so it's not about so in in a way is about the content because through the content you give them the experience but I meant I I understand what you said yeah so is the video that should basically is if last if they are thinking out loud yeah it's like yeah but what could be good I don't know is that yeah maybe just try you to you try something and then if not and then we can check tomorrow uh we come back on that point tomorrow because I think should be this is also some point that is not clarified here um we need to clar this also uh for the for as more to clarify clarify more the research is um we went to that point the last time a bit [Music] um is about the audience who is perceiving people doing Pathfinder or is about about um the people who are doing Pathfinder because that was some point that the last week we we came and we don't have to we just put it here in some notes we need to clarify that at some point but not because this can get in Twain right um because you were saying the last week for instance like the which I agree is like so in my in my writing today when I said yeah embodying the [Music] dots like when a person perceives and interact with the image [Music] um this yeah when I was writing about this I thought that's a that could be a tricky thing I mean you can extend it more because when we see from the video You and Me in the video doing the the thing you and me doing the thing is just an interface right we agree on that like that you and me are the interface for the audience to perceive something different right but that's a second step a first step will be I mean it's like you are so you being the we being the interface in the space I mean in that grid space it's it's a two different it's a two different two different paths one is like you being you becoming the dot which I think I mean I like that naturally you go in that path like when you grow to Rafael and and M also you said like we are embodied the dot that's why I I start writing from there um and I'm trying to just like be from out um I mean from the audience Point like from from more abstract perspective but these are two different that these are two different things totally yeah you as a performer you as a performer and you as an audience seeing the performer doing per so yeah performer as interface and audience just that I just put it in the notes for here we don't say about nothing difference between performer as interface pH and what on viewer audience yeah my comments keep eye on it well that's really important because I think especially like if you want like to do more like the research like you have to like clarify what is and it's easily that's why I think that's this process is nice because in the we naturally we are doing this practice I mean we attach how we do practice so we put different elements but then easily can just become intangle then are difficult to clarify if there is a third person who wants to understand not for us I mean or at least not for us like we can uh uh disentangle in the conversation like I'm right like we understand each other in the way how we speak but then if a third person comes then might have a problem yeah right and it's about the communication so about the communication yeah yeah also like in the present like if you ask audience member to do the exercise then that person becomes the performer right so that's something like I think we don't have to mention but if when there's like questions and options like I'm sure like someone's going to ask that question right what question well related to this topic you know uh yeah but I don't know like it's hard to elaborate but someone might ask is it experience for the one who's doing Pathfinder as a performer or is it about the audience watching the performer you know like one can ask like you know for what person for what role you were designing this no I think that should be clear now now that we speaking because that can become like problematic but I think it should be clarified that it's like the the person is an interface so in that sense at least at uh yeah for the I mean like the writing like the piece of the writing that I put today was more from the point of view of the of of the performer but I don't think we should mention that too much like uh right I think we should focus on the perspective perspective of the audience because the questions are about the focus is yes that is like for now like but this is something that definitely we keep an eye can expand and we have the experience is on the performer so I guess that's why that was my that I guess that's why I am my intention with this is like to force myself to be in that seat of the audience because I having I have the experience with the performer yeah but I think what why this question interesting is because it touches the point that um I paraphrase like the way I wrote was yeah basically I was comparing you know physical body as a dancer and the digital Avatar as a dancer like why you don't feel empathy right because in our case there is actually physical person who's doing the interpretation so it's even though the person as a performer is a medium or interface we can't neglect the fact that it's a person and that's why people find empathy to the person in the video or someone who's wearing the headset not it's not a dot it is a dot yeah it is not a dot but that's it's through the person it's through the imperfection of the of Being Human that the that is that the audience conects I mean that the audience gets into this uh process of new meanings right but anyways our focus is the audience that's that's like so it's not like you know conflicting at all but just like you know different in you know like interpretation or you know like angles we can see this but yeah but we we're not conflicting at all right like the points we raised but this is an interesting thing like because it's I see that it's getting because you start saying something and I'm think I start giving me like some opening in my head like to question like what we get into these feedback loops the practice like what everything is possible like what but wait depends how you're seeing that it's always about P yeah the perception of like how the the angle that you're seeing the right the proposal the perspective yeah viewpoint but maybe I will put it here like I think this is something maybe should be in the in the what is it in the video like tell people why difference between performers yeah you're there like video score output video score the angle this is a slash uh uncertainty you know it means like this is I think this is depends of the angle goes into we have been speaking of this a lot like this uh yeah the uncertainty of working with technology I mean the non nonbinary process yeah process yeah the unability like yeah some like something that that we like in the video but the video is not a documentary is it I don't know like this is I'm this is just like wishes I guess like I wish that maybe that there's something about that but maybe there is not okay let's not make it more complicated now it's already complicated no it's it's good yeah it's all good yes I think tomorrow I will be from here so I I think I can be I'll try to be more like at two or before two okay it depends how is your time tomorrow yeah I I might be out I mean for the during the day so uh but I'll try to get this video done in the morning and then yeah I'll let you know when I come home yeah just let me know when I'm I think yeah I think the well I aim for it to yeah yeah okay yeah all right so we talk hey it's great I'm really excited like working with this like yeah and the we clock we should do something with the clock yeah the Pathfinder Pathfinder cook we should make a tattoo in our backs now we should make an inter out like should be possible like to make a just tattoo they GRE and then somehow that some ink like because now there are these inks that they change with the color with some lights oh so then they just the dot moves the pending of the light that you have then you see a Pathfinder changing in your back crazy bioh hack and I was thinking also that could be that um could to artificial intelligence or something that maybe at some point also it could be just the square because now you have a square now that could be a square or something that it just moves in because there is like so the the space is is abstract there is not the G space but it just Moves In Space it just moves in the space you know what I was actually thinking that maybe the next step could be we should actually limit the movements you know I don't know one step was we could together do count how many moves have Pathfinder in a minute how many of this because I mean I started finding recognizing as you said like at some point it does this yeah uh but like to really do that exercise of counting how many steps are and I think they should be a lot if the the dot moves almost like this no yeah so it's it's almost I mean it's more it's more than a minute per second no should be wait what more than a minute what what what well actually one cycle is more than one minute I say we say it's one minute but it's actually like one minute and four seconds or something but then each move so each movement anyway of is like almost is two seconds is is faster than one second each of these movements each of them are two seconds each of these are two seconds yeah ah okay so say it's 30 say that is thir so there are only 30 if they look there are more like say like that we should like do even less like say like we just put uh half 16 like two times 8 16 movements um not for now what I'm thinking is like to because we are in that reducing process like now we're reducing more because when you reduce more then for instance we said we have even if you said we have eight movements so then you can start playing with also with other qualities of the movement you know like then it's maybe you can start playing with other things once there are more once everything is narrow down right um but but that's I mean that's a one possible process yeah yeah that maybe we can talk afterwards um because it does in terms of quality of movement you know that then is not only that but then it just it's yeah it's different but then for to go to go there you need we we need Precision like for both we need we need understand we need uh that is understandable from both sides that we are in the same page and then we can do it otherwise like at the place that we are the way who I I divide it is like following and free but free is anything so uh I was thinking that maybe I would like to go or I tried to do that some days ago but then like in reducing steps but then yeah for now is not necessary but maybe it could be interesting for the next process that we reduce more then we Define how much do we need to reduce or why is it why is the we are reducing and then we we go for a sec iteration right yeah it's actually interesting like almost like it becomes like dance steps right it's more like one two three four and one two three four it just like repeats yeah but and also what I think that is like cool is that I think that this is what we're doing is conceptually I think is completely the opposite what we do with uh best practices because with best practices just like it's just potentiality in itself it just explodes in any direction you know it's like it's just more and more and more and more until the screen is just glitched and you have to reset to clean the buffer right and so for me what I like is like it's completely other processes then it's just less less less less less but what if you have just four movements yeah like you need you really need to go into what we are saying in the text you need to find ways to Res signify that for yourself first as performer because otherwise you cannot hold it if you have to do the same action for half an hour it's like a b process like somehow I guess like like yeah then you are just you need to find something you need to find something because it's too simple the way we're doing it it's it's too simple so how to keep it interesting yeah how to keep it interesting right in practices I think what we do is like it's so crazy that you don't almost understand I mean that's why like for us is quite okay like for the audience the audience is very selective like the audience needs to insist to stay there but for us it's just a pleasure because it's just freedom in itself yeah um but then here is the other side of that coin I mean at least that's the way who I think and that's what I was mentioning like even years in this process because like I think we can really expand through Academia and performance like we we can expand that process and and make it something that is Noble for the field um but we are at the other side of the spectrum like if practice is just crazy as then the there is it's just too much that is just too exciting this process I see that is just too boring to them how to Comm how to communicate through that thing yeah and that's why like it it starts to reveal the medium it helps I think it will yeah I think in yeah yeah in that sense yeah because it's slow down the process yeah so we see other things that we didn't see yeah by slowing down but what we say like I just want just I want to put this as notes that and we need to find alha name for what we're doing is it that is what we're doing is it is a practice what are we doing we need to I call it new project I like sigil but that it entangles something what's the antonym of practice new project title I always like the a name for a piece but well let call a new project I don't know what is this I don't know what is this um but then we said like reducing it's slow down now practice process reducing slow down PR practice process um all Almost Boring or how to help yeah for boring but this is funny because in the practice one of the phrases that I use often is like the practice lingers at the threshold of exciting and forgetting right but forgetting something is not the same that something is boring no it's a different thing right well about forgetting things for me is more something that is it's not important right like to forget something for me is that something is because it's not important but not necessarily sorry right it could be exciting too you forget time or you know like sense of time or something that you don't pay attention to in a way something that you don't pay attention yes but this is not this is interesting because in the practice like the way who I perceived was like you do so you do so much that is just up for the people to sometimes catch things um so it's always happening that was oh I mean within that frame that you said like time starts time stops um allowed you for viewer to stay um but I guess my intention was more close to what we're doing now with the sync version of pfinder that this for me my intention was to say that it is always there like now we have a version of Pathfinder there is always it is an absolute truth for me that's important is it is always running there like no matter of what you do it is always there if there's not a shortcut or something is not happening like like it always like it is there running nobody needs to open the page some somehow it it will be always in the same place [Music] um that was somehow like how I see in the practice like that it's always there even if you go and you're you're not watching but you're doing the dishes and then sometimes come like the practice is still is happening right I mean you know we don't have to always make a contrast between those two it can be you know something similar or something you know because we're trying like this process is actually trying to make more like the truth so practices this and you know like may actually doing binary process but it's actually not because you know down lineing thing is you know also shared so that's something like I well you know just do just to recognize that yeah but this is something that I recognize like if you see Al in writing of how I speak I often do I see like two options I often I propose I see this like this or like that very binary but this is it's yeah hope happens naturally yeah of course you know I mean it's it's it's it's easy way to I mean not easy but you know effective or starting point to because you needed reference right somehow can't you can't just you know come up with something new it's new because it has a reference is not it's just come to existence all well actually um yeah like when I was hanging out with this friend muray few days ago she told me you know like she thought like I am someone like just emerged in this world and started creating artwork those funny because she doesn't know my background I mean we we met like you know like a few week ago I mean like around the same time I met you so yeah I mean I went to engineering school and you know I studied but she described me that I just you know like like landed on the earth and started creating artworks which is not far away from like that's what happen happens no you just you're just omitting that a big chunk of from where but it is like you land in Earth and then at some point you do art yeah true true just I guess the scope is different yeah yeah and that's funny like because in quantum mechanics like the whole point is in the scope like they think they speak a lot of how how I mean the fact that you can start speaking about or questioning um fact somehow is based on the scale of how how deep are you in in scale so how much of the true is visible to you uh yeah true is it yeah let's wrap up let's wrap up like start speaking about time let's change the scope yeah this is a bigger picture not not going to deep into this time okay uh so but you try to put something about like the video of yeah maybe like super simple draft I don't know depends on the energy I have see what see what you find like of I mean of this about the experience of the video and then yeah um and send me you sent me already a link of of a Google drive there it's there is there already already okay cool did you have them or did you just export them while you were talking with me no I had it already Okay can I check actually yeah is that the one that I you no no what I meant is the video of the of the Greet of us I mean the video that we will use the GRE the greed of us in G of us okay yeah yeah syn of like you in the space in the paper me in VR right because the one is in YouTube I think it's five videos so if you can upload one of three you can send me uh the physical version of one of three minutes what like the so the video there is in the document right of of the grid yeah uh so if you can send me that video the original video of that one that's one that's the one on YouTube right the one that is on YouTube yeah yeah and if you can export that as a three minute video oh I see because it's five minutes yeah I mean just to have vot and then I check okay to see if to see if it's too long I mean to have both because I will just put them as a physical in a in a presentation slide but do you think you can just like edit it yourself if you just sent me the five I exported the three yeah okay yeah I'll just put it in the same folder yeah yeah yeah so the one with you in the VR headset and and me with the notebook and in the park exactly yeah wait cool so it should be there already I think you can't do preview but montage Call Montage yeah yeah good yes all right then I'm going to walk before I see some light yeah it's good idea still now and they going to go out okay H great talk talk to you tomorrow about time and space Y and scope and scope so", "M3VDvGXbJds": "wait I don't hear you somehow um is it I don't hear you okay let's see you say something uh yeah can you hear me now yes yes I did something weird it's fine so are you good is snowing it's snowing here oh really crazy maybe you can see from my window I mean was snowing oh wow so but kind of like melt you know when it snow snows but it's melting so the street should be a mess I guess oh yeah like flushy yeah like just but yeah that the West Park or it's this is the West Park yeah oh wow okay so you're like right next to it yeah literally and it looks and it changes in like in in months like in two months like the views completely change because at the beginning you see nothing because full are green so it's just you see nothing oh okay because there trees in front of it trees in front of me and then slowly they start losing their so then basically I see more depth now that the trees have no leaves wow that's crazy how is there like is it colder like it is cold yes like cold I mean it's it's not snowing cold but it is cold um I don't know how but we don't have like Heating and uh and house you know like like normally like in Germany they have heating right like it's embedded integrated yeah like we don't have that so we have to like we have you know heating like heer yeah electrical one or gas but in this room we don't have it like we have air conditioner but I heard it's broken oh well it's not warm so I'm freezing but you know it's fine and yeah so how do we do it like we have um I think we should talk like a little bit of just like what is going to happen I mean I think in short let's say let's talk more uh concrete like what this the task we put yesterday especially the questions like yeah Y and so let's do after that after the conversation so not now because that will take a bit yeah this is yeah something that takes time yeah by the way this so I don't know if you saw the video but I notice like so this low light thing that I want to try I was just checking now like but what so what you took away like so what is doing now it's just so it's not it's just doing the movement but it's not showing the camera exactly so it's like this environment with the camera but it's just showing the lines like not the camera it just shows the movement and I was like yeah like this is the way to do it then it's just easy but this is that's yeah that's way better yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah but then but anyway like I was thinking that that I don't know like we have to see so I think maybe just with videos we should maybe we could show something because that like could be tricky to count that it will work something in there CU When I was yesterday then sometimes work sometimes not working like uh because anyway you need light for the camera to see like yes like it works like I mean it works as the output works but for the in for for the input you need light otherwise there is you need some sorts of light like the camera needs to see movement yeah yeah and that's that yesterday was a bit tricky right so we'll see um but I like like the like I like the videos like how did use how did you sync just manually like it's hard this one was really hard because I can't really see your movements but the I was thinking on that sorry yeah so the way I did it like after like some iterations I noticed that in the the Pathfinder there is one moment that you go up down up up and this is something like noticeable like other parts it's really hard to distinguish which part is which but this this is because only like vertical movement so this is something I could you know if I scroll through I can find it because it's really like you know different from other parts of the movement and then I find out you know like how I syn R but you know I was thinking that maybe we could use like that for that we could put um a clock for the buing like just the the time and then because I put it here then because then we know even if we are lost we know like for both sides that's what I put in the notes like it that that should be we don't know exactly when because it will be different depending of the time that you're doing I'm doing it but it will be z z at some point you know it will be yeah you know that you will at some point at the cycle of z z yeah I think we I should make it so that this version of op Optical flow at least would have Pathfinder in it maybe so we see everything at the same time because the thing is the optical flow doesn't have has nothing to do with Pathfinder you you see the video right when you the one yeah so they they are not synchronized at all so I have to come up with the way to put both in the same page then we can see it together this Optical flow or we could render a video of Pathfinder with the time stamp on it and you somehow like show that Pathfinder video in the recording the thing is that the recording needs to have time stamp right when you record Optical flow or camera yeah yeah we need time stamp in that we need to time stamp I didn't so actually the the video but yeah we we'll find out how to do it so when you record it this time like you open one screen with Optical flow and another screen with Pathfinder or yeah have I have projected right yeah so that's like a full screen yeah and then here somewhere it was Optical flow but so I was not watching Optical flow I was watching p f right yeah yeah I think it's also like important not to see too much of what you're doing but also anyways because wait like what is I have so many windows open it should be here o I'm watching the and you did the same I mean you did like the one to the left was only the hand the one to the right was your full body yeah yeah let's think let's think together how to do it again this yeah but I think it's really really good um Direction I mean visually it looks very good now yeah yeah I don't know if I like the colors but it's kind of interesting also but how did you put it in how did you record it because I didn't manage to because justs I just manually did it in OBS just make it you know bigger try to fill a screen oh with OBS you sent you you selected yeah smart I didn't thought of that was one of the things that I realized is that I'm doing a lot of [Music] setups at some point I get a bit confused of I was using because I was using my phone to record so there the phone was sending yeah with something the Max has with the new phones you can use the camera from OBS so but also Norm normally I will use my phone to record using stream thing this uh normally so I'm using now often this thing from Elgato that I that we ask in Luana to buy right and I have there's one thing from here I told me so then I use often now to record that which is very practical then you go to the space and just record oh to trigger it yeah yeah yeah just trigger record and stop from like in the distance yeah um but then yeah I was using that and yeah It's Tricky one to pay attention full attention of what is going on right what happens like I I wouldn't imagine like interacting I mean you're trying to especially if if it's w why is happening man the is it you this some video me come on oh my gosh you're not going to start the practice [Music] now um ah okay let's just open Windows here so but I think might like uh no okay let's so let's talk maybe a bit of the what we talk of I need to open these things made DP so I guess the meeting of today will be just like more to fix dates I think if I understood noo yeah or like a plan things you know how we proceed I guess what we need yeah so what we said and come on basically we have like three days of like work session right like Workshop how how did they say workshop with them with them with them yeah because they will be on site we won't be on site M fny yeah our master plan yeah I also thought maybe to go but like no no to much so yeah I mean also like I think maybe I mean we only have like 10 minutes but we should think like what do we do what do we need to develop right like as a Content actually I'm just saying because you know otherwise we don't know what tools we need to no that's why I think and I think maybe this in this we should like somehow frame what we doing without telling that we are advancing that then we don't have to do it twice um so it's three weeks that we have with them I mean two two weeks that we have with them no no just three days days I think yeah but two weeks that we have like normally work that we are working online two weeks online yes but I don't know their availability yeah but really it's really not clear like how many days they will be able to work no I guess yeah we see that but I guess like we should count just with them three days yeah so what do we need at this moment like for where we are like [Music] um well so first thing I like initially I had communicated with William was ah because we need AI so it was something with Hydra and you know try to make some kind of generative Hydra cod with AI I think that was the here that we had but I think now it's kind of like we're Shifting the focus a little bit Yeah I think like I wouldn't put it as priority right now I think we can like do something with that but I won't put it as priority no um what do you think like this like what we're doing can be connected to machine learning AI like what's the straightforward way to do it I mean we could also brainstorm that later with them just tell them what we're doing now and CU I think that yeah just be honest with them now we're interested in this and then you know like we want to present something along this line and think they're fine with it I was thinking like yeah could be something with was like a u yeah with image composition like through much learning or something like this like based on did you check out the link I sent you like the new one I made um it's moving a DOT that's the last one I didn't saw the last one yeah I can do screen sharing because one thing I noticed is like what if we do it other way around like that normally people would think so yeah I should show the camera you see the dot right yeah H and people think that you are like there is that you're doing motion tracking with that or something yeah I mean it is kind of it's like super super basic yeah it is it's using optical flow so basically it's doing optical flow and ex like just taking the sum of everything on the screen and that's moving the dot but now I don't see the DOT thought cuz I'm trying my camera maybe it's gone you can retry star I mean I just made it so it might not work actually okay now I see it uhhuh so it's showing the average of all that flow or what yes so whatever happens on the screen it's a Ing and moving the dot I mean I can just move it in the circle or you know it doesn't have to be like Pathfinder oh so yeah is not that is the hand yeah of course now I see it yeah it's better with whole body not not just with hand I mean this works too I I just made it because you know this is something people would normally think when we do like this kind of interactive performance no I like that it's is a bit blurry it's quite blurry but that's what I like [Music] then I mean something like that like could be just we will need a lot of back and forth in tuning because you have to learn how to perform the thing and just the Cod or like so it has to be a lot of back and forth until come something that we can play as performer and um so I think that could become one thing in itself um like instrument yeah I think that's one thing in Intel um okay like but let's but now let's back go back to the me how what do we need uh or how could we so the thing is artificial intelligence what we're talking right now like that we have to do something with artificial intelligence right well I just I showed you this because I thought you know this is something we could add like more layers of machine learning for example right yeah like that could be a like um if you go to certain point I mean you you could put like you could learn to the thing to do stuff right right if you move to I mean if there is certain if you reach certain things then something will happen right like gesture recognition but something very simple okay but so this is a gesture recognition I think I like the gesture though I mean so this I mean this could be something that is straightforward with image right um would be uh the other thing I'm think it's the straightforward also could be sound like there's some sound thing can to something um um I mean that could come together actually right so like just a recognition that creates sound or the sound texture relates to the quality of the movement for example yeah yeah yeah then it really becomes like an instrument like musical instrument yeah and does it have to be I mean because the way I see the sound is should be more like a um a background I mean like almost more like like a syn or something that is very deep like so something not too much yeah I was thinking like I still want to use some songs like I don't know how it's you know like licens or we find someone we can use their song but something like pop like how we would do in practice but I think it can be you know like different scenes like it can something syn or droney that happens in the middle and in the end we just play pop songs I think that kind of contrast is also interesting no I I I mean I definitely think we should do like get in the flow like to do a practice like a practice of what we do um so that I think that will come there but I'm I'm not focusing in this right now no um um and also I'm thinking is it in a way how to I mean keep developing like that we keep on working in in the same time what we're doing now with Academy and then also this so that to not become to to not make two Works to different things then then we cannot do that totally I mean at least for February we have to use something from the academy right yeah like the focus like what I'm trying to focus like now is like in the academy yeah yeah certainly let's go there and yeah I think it like we just share what we have and yeah yeah I think I think somehow like this maybe could be something would it be like if if you could control windows with your movement like Windows of like Windows of of the videos okay let's go there yes yeah I think yeah good good good um yeah okay see there so I think I think it was quite clear no the meeting with them yeah what what I like is that uh it makes sense like we will have because we basically we just start thinking how to really yeah in a way merge or make sense of what we're doing right now so but we will have time like and also we are experimenting with ideas um that's part of basically what we're going to do right now like to think like to to reflect on what we're doing and I'm sure like then then we will have more clear Clarity in which angle can this apply yeah but I was happy and it's kind of clear yeah I think I think it's great it's like I was just keep telling myself like not to say that we're going to reuse the material because we have to create something new right so that's something that we have to be clear about it like although we're using well it's like we're using tools from there but it's it's a different piece project yeah yeah it is a different thing because for the Academy won't be a yeah I mean it's the same thing actually for us exactly that's that's the thing the way how you frame it yeah the way how you say it but I think like to be honest like the way Al like no no like thing is everywhere so just like it's just more he wouldn't care he wouldn't care I know but it's more about the framing yeah say like so I want to ask you so like do they confirm you now did they accept you then in in taling or what did they confirm that or not so the thing is like the committee the professors uh they accept it but they have to do some kind of formal procedure and that takes time okay so but in a way like is now accepted yes okay great super so now like you will be some years there yeah that's something now I'm figuring out because yeah let's no talk about it like I'm just like super like saturated about this matter then that's just like basically I have to get the visa as soon as possible for Estonia yeah so that I like yeah that make make more sense that fix the problem in Germany know like just exactly this is this is like interesting thing I I learned like it doesn't really matter like whatever like like Germany is like like nothing to do with me anymore in a way no of course like yeah no and yeah because like you are banned from German know or not from the sh no the Netherlands I mean it's M from Holland you're M from Netherlands exact exactly I mean that well the Netherlands will ask uh will register me to be banned from shenen Zone this is really crazy it is so screwed up but if I can get a Visa soon from Estonia then that's a reason why like reason to you know not to ban me from this this yeah that's that's how things work and yeah but it makes sense it will be fine really crazy yeah yeah I just hope that you can have like these papers and you could be here in January at some point yeah I mean I'm aiming for February like the first week of February that would be great yeah yeah I mean January to but I I don't think it's yeah let's let's talk about it later about that let's talk about the content now yeah yeah so but okay let me check I was just going to read read so maybe you can read but I just pause my thing yeah check my my I check yours yeah I read it so should we like explain it or uh like I will say like the if I can jump like I think I like that's the way how we work that's I think that's why it helps like because you're really like it's really practical what you propose and I was trying to be practical but it just becomes always like that um but I think it complement like both things yeah so what I will said is that I see like the [Music] the what do you what do what do you mean when you said like three right so that's that's the minutes right like yeah two basically before that I mean very first we show the video I mean the link is there which video like the video that is there yeah is that video sync kind of syn this is synchronized well quite well okay that's not the one with delay no that's the one who is right the synchronized one and yeah yeah think yeah then the idea I just had was to you go around to the audience and ask them you know like what is happening in the video or more concretely like what are is hor seeing in VR or like what I'm now was what is now to seeing on the phone to just guess from the audience just from seeing video so this is like the first thing that you're saying is like so there is no reveal pfinder being like so this is like first like to show three minutes of this video that's about you right without any explanation yeah and and [Music] then and then then and then then and then from there and then while that is happening then you were saying like to talk with people to to say what are they seeing yeah so the video is finished and then you go to the audience and ask them you know like what you think I mean this is something you have to we have to phrase it well because it's really not clear but I want to ask the audience to guess what was happening in the video intro I think like should be some anyway like some small short intro of what is that I'm doing I mean it should be like some short intro that could be just one minute I just put it here no this oh yeah okay I'll put it just here next to it just short intro and I mean what I'm thinking is might this might be tricky like I mean to this could be like they really engage with the people but could be also really killer like if it's people not getting engag if you ask somebody like what are you seeing like is there uh but I guess your int let's I get your intention let me because this is your score so maybe just try to go like after so so this is happening then for yes at first like I mean I was thinking like either you ask around or I mean and or the next one which is like we have like interview video of ourselves like pre-recorded that we talk about you know experience but not saying that what is happening yeah so we don't we still hide what was happening that we are following the dot but we talk about you know what we would talk in the chat for example you know like this embodiment like well embodiment or you know some you know your experience of doing this exercise so that you know the audience is still kind of confused of like what is happening intro Okay no Okay uh but does make sense okay so likeing somehow so this is clear there something clear clear than is this is the video right then just move you here when I have this more space wait wait wait wait CU so short this has to be so greeting small thing video this is three minutes I will put it here like as a tentative that ask around what people see you know what because what I finding could be problematic here is that you're trying to you don't know how long it will can take this you know this can become like five minutes so perhaps could be is that in the way how we manage because the thing is we would like the people to think something about it no so before you show the video no like so no so you introduce the work then um then you introduce the video and you ask them for the people to think what is happening like for the people to think on P of what is happening is is is what is happening why these people are doing this like to for them to try to find yeah um yeah let's just keep adding things let's just keep adding things and then we can you know I will I will so let's not uh I will let's see how we Mo this but people we should ask the people Som how what what ask ask around what people see what is happening yeah I mean this could be also scripted right just you you know have a volunteer I mean not volunteer but like you already script something with someone in the audience yeah just I'm just throwing things you know because this is something that comes next that I thought about is to do a demo with the VR headset like you are doing but I thought instead of you doing it audience can do it but just tell that to one person not to everyone so that one person do the demo yeah and this could be scripted that you know you already coordinate with someone okay that could be done like that we can ask somebody so that it's still like a mystery for other people what is happening but then that has to be rehearsed like because that the person need open that needs to be open I mean it's not too complicated with somebody yeah somebody needs to I mean you need to go with v and you need to do it in V so in the browser yeah doesn't it's not in the browser I mean because I have a video oh it's a video there's a video there yeah um I mean it could be a screen you know not to make it complicated but the screen is facing to the stage like a prompter or could be actually to the phone actually that would could be phone yeah true be the phone and the people are just facing the ask somebody and so I think this [Music] um okay ref like so this is a so we have to put a video where there is this interview right I'm I'm still so here so ask one is happening then a small interview keep inside oh the interview with the audience yeah no this is this is interview what do you think what we're seeing ah this is this is what you I thought that was hor n no that's that's this one I mean it could be shorter but but also what could happen is like there I'm sure there should be people already they have seen because I'm doing that every day so like what somebody like and then they just kill the magic to what do you think yeah I think it's also important to think like that this should work even if someone knows what is happening in behind okay we need to find to solve this how to do this so we need to solve how to do this or yeah so but so yeah we need to it's part of the askar around it's we need to solve it and then about experience so I'm saying this you see my cursor right yeah yeah so I'm seeing this this is connected to this part all of this I'm seeing this connected somehow this the video the video Until yeah the video Until the what you call the interview right and and then this will be a different thing right so and this is something that we don't have yet no like we need then we talk about experience yeah I thought like individually it would be more I mean it can be both like it can be like a conversation like this or you know just filming it individually I don't know which is better actually okay we need but do we need to do maybe this is good actually like or even like we just like cut something from the chat that we already have we need to solve this so this is something that we need to do still this is this must be do must be done yeah so this is part of the things that this is one thing that we don't have right right stra to do the one person from the audience B finder and this yeah and this we Define but this totally can be fine like this can be done um yeah I think maybe I know there should be other people there so if I can I mean this could be like the easiest way is just the phone but if I manage to rehearse that with somebody then then we do it in VR yeah um watch pfinder together do with all I mean with everyone with in the audience I I will say that we could go and we could try to to do this as it is as a script as as like to follow and see I mean I I will say like that we will try this to see and time this because then we need to find I mean practically speaking uh what is this how what is the computer I mean I need to think in the space how it works right so I will say let's start from here I don't think I think it's a good start [Music] um short intro this a short intro this be like two minutes so I say that's two minutes this is five minutes this could be S minutes this until here could be 10 minutes and we have to do this this could take five minutes until it's fixed you know until you find somebody the person gets the thing so it's 15 minutes and then five minutes to end and then five so the all this short all this intro so this this is 2 minutes this is five minutes I mean three five minutes more or less then ask around 7 Minutes somehow I would say like until here more or less as 10 minutes 12 minutes something like this right together uh and so I will say this is the interaction action yeah Interac with audience so what we're gonna show is actually I mean because we have so many exercises but let's let's watch together this kind the the video okay I'm going to share it start this is five minutes actually oh you get edited yeah can you show the clock to know when are we in three minutes I mean the yeah thanks if you do full screen that can you do full screen oh no you cannot is it it break yeah it break uh yeah okay share screen again did you start minut number two that's what you did uh this I started from the very beginning sorry can you put it from the beginning again I think we should start from one minute or something because you are like still preparing in the top left maybe this is okay but but I think it's kind of fine also if it's that it doesn't matter I think could be like I think you should put it from the beginning like who it is yeah because it syn so I think it's is nice still s and also your page is not yet I mean it's more clean your page under yeah I don't know if like one minute is enough no I think you can I mean this is like almost two minutes right because maybe what I can do is like maybe I can actually I mean I can let it run from two minutes like and then ask the people I mean talk while the video is happening you know like say like the to so like really so like to invite you to think right now if you can find patterns there is definitely something that is connecting these two buddies or the four Images so what could this be what is that these people are saying that you cannot see that was my script I should have is this recording this is recording I guess yeah yes okay so top right is done oops sorry what happened yeah the rest continues it has to be in three I mean yeah it depends this could be also fine yeah actually if you're just yeah going to [Music] the okay okay okay so I have like yeah I invite you to think what is happening in the four videos what are the patterns why are this why are these people moving this why are these people moving why are they [Music] moving why are they moving are they seeing that you cannot yeah see what you think you seeing interview what do you think about experience when are we talking about do you mean with the experience what you mean what do you mean with experience I mean like basically like yeah what do you mean with experience like the like what is the interview what is the question that we trying to record of ourselves I thought like you know because after I don't know which date but we talked about like I thought it's something about embodiment but maybe is something I thought about or did we talk about but there was something interesting about like actually doing the movement of the dot and then then people would you know perceive it differently compared to like geometry compared to the line or Dot I mean but then we're kind of revealing it yeah this is I mean I gr something like like wait like somewhere yesterday on that is I don't know did you read the the thing that I sent you this paragraph the book yeah I went through it's just a paragraph but maybe you can just read it video because I think it's very it's very important it's because it's in what are you Al ah this it extended the screen I'm used to work with three screens now then now I have only one a feel so yeah H what I'm trying to do to find My Notes actually yeah it is in the in the B I mean in my notes I put it you see my my cursor in what would you like wait where is it oh okay yeah um it says what the inter so the interface is Pathfinder so is binary code that runs always in the browser the dot Moves In The Grid space always regardless of the of the audience it always repeat with a binary Precision but new meaning making process appears with the subjective P perception and interaction of the audience viewer so this is connected to like the the the it's like it's a big separation between like the interface is there like the like I'm saying in a way like as as it is it's a DOT that is always moving and it's it's a binary thing it's exact and always will do the same it's only through the human interpretation like the new meaning making process happening it's only so like the art in a way what I'm saying is like the art happens only with the interpretation of the audience right yeah but yeah something I didn't understand at first is you're saying sense making happens through the audience eye right because in the book I felt it's more like interacting and you know the person who's interacting with the machine like this sense making happens there but in our case there is Pathfinder which is the binary or digital content and then there's a body but not that body is doing sens making but the Sens making happens in the audience with third person in a way oh like the so like the okay okay so you're saying like that the audience like the audience watching the videos watching the bodies and the video the Audi is watching the output I mean the videos that we have which are body interpreting that right and the moving bodies are just the medium the moving bodies are just the medium yeah I agree with that the moving bodies are just a medium the M like yeah so the the video so in this case actually the video is the interface because it's through the it's through the video that the the the audience try to make sense of something that they don't know and the bodies are also the interface yeah the I I was say like the video so like the videoos the medium the med the videoos the medium what it how the communication happens between uh the audience and the artist um but the bodies what did you say the bodies are the interface medium I mean interface is it medium or interface I don't know or can be both because in the book The Visitor or the audience interacts with the media art right in the paragraph let's read it just for a second you could just pres present the video that we just talked I just read out loud I present an analyze of the relationships between the body and the technology as a co- constitutive and collaboratively produced experience I will outline what is at stake in this reconsideration arguing arguing that the the relationships between the body and technology in interactive Med new medum installations is unstable uncertain and to certain extent open to reconfiguration by the viewer participant I think this is an important point I mean if if you seen in the in my notes maybe what is um relevant is like I mean I said what would you like are things that they are not there yet um but that could that I would like to extend to expand so one of them for instance is like things that that basically we that come to the practice like the use um the underlying importance of the glitch ontology which is basically that like just what the paragraph says like the UN like the nature of how unstable are that relationship um right but I don't know I mean to be honest like the thing is the the way how you propose it but that's what I'm saying like I think we complement the word we do the thing you propose is very simple like for me is it's very flat um and I like it so far like because it's flat like for me like I see like one of the things I would like is that the people understanding that there is not going to be something that is there is not something good or bad to see in what follows but there is uh more like the presentation of something that is uh in a process making together with them in the space so is regardless of be show it show them something that it is or must be in this way it is something that it is to be shared with the people in the space in a open form underlining the the the the underlining this and I maybe literally I can just use one of these sentences outline I will outline let take the relationships between the body and technology in media installations or in media art are unstable on certain and to certain extent open to reconfiguration by the viewer participant this is what I really I mean for me it's important that to say like that's that's um maybe let's come back to the call it's going to finish now Zoom so it's same L toilet toilet toilet okay uh but I guess I mean this will be we need to find a way how to because I think this should be part of like the beginning of the intro somehow like that uh maybe even could be just like projected even in words I mean that doesn't have to be decided now but well I think so I kind of I think I understood your point and what's tricky here is this is like linear performance or not I don't know how to say it but we go through something but the book is about like the visitor has the freedom to interact right um yes I mean so my point is like yeah yeah okay okay yes it's true like it's but I think I think I also see that it relates I don't see a difference in yeah so I think what makes sense to me is we have like a kind of a message well the message that we want to convey but at the same time we give room for interpretation because if it's total freedom then they will get really lost but we give something and then they can expand from there I think right yeah yeah so and that can be literally just said like I think it that's [Music] um yeah but I think that we could we should this exercise and I think we should get more uh used to do this because then it helps like I mean literally can be just said that you know like you can say like present you something but you can I'm completely invited you like you're you're invited to please expand from there yeah because we we're not providing the truth yeah that's that's very important actually to note yep but okay but let's let me read it like this because I guess there was a reason why I sent you there was something so and it's true like this is but it's I think it's partially like I don't think there is necessarily the only the the they're talking about like physical installations all the time but sometimes get a bit blurry and I and I try also to take it from perspective I mean TR try to make it work in in what we're doing yeah should I continue yeah yeah where was it where you at um the relationships between the body and Technology uh how might a reconation of the relationship between the body and Technology as co- constitutive and collaboratively produced help us find alternative routs into and different ways of thinking about the interface in interactive New Media installations to address these questions in the first half of this chapter I examine how the relationship between the body and technology is articulated through the use of the embodied interface in the artwork of Victoria BNA and TOA these installation are crucial to this investigation as the embodied interface is positioned as co-constitutive and processual an entity that is produced by and is constantly producing subjects objects and meanings I buil on this analysis in the second half of this chapter exploring how representationalist structures of meaning manifest themselves in interactive New Media installations I suggest that the ability to participate in the meaning making process provides the viewer participant with an opportunity to engage with subvert and restructure within certain parameters the underlying narratives that help shape her experience in interactive New Media installations and this this point very relevant like for me that yeah right but this just the ability to like the the ability like the the audience have the ability to participate I mean that that uh ability uh on the meaning making process it provides the opportunity for them to create a piece basically out of right that's what I was saying like with the with the piece with the piece with Pathfinder like the Pathfinder that's that was my comment is only just uh it's a code running perfectly but only when the person interact through this meaning making process BEC something that is right or than just the code is yeah so I put they I I posit I posit that this approach shift from shifts shifts Focus away from theorizing the subject in a positional or binary terms as an operational entity whose actions are defined as exterior to technology toward considering her an integral part of the installation this I'm seeing is the same as what we doing I mean I'm seeing what we we presenting is an installation somehow an embodied viewer participant whose interactions with the digital interface have consequences in interactive New Media art installations that you want to read the notion of the notion of an embodied viewer participant whose interactions have repercussions in interactive New Media installations enables me to theorize the encounter between the viewer participant and the embodied interface as generative as an ongoing open-ended process from this perspective the embodied interface is unstable uncertain and open to reconfiguration as the designation of the viewer participant rather than interface as locus of interaction means that the illusion that illusion that the artist has complete control over the action occurring in the installation is to an extent broken this is repeating the same I mean the I mean this is on the same point no that like that a yeah that that the interface is unstable un certain and open to configuration yeah yeah I I will read this like and if I see like maybe there is like something that of the chapter that maybe that is relevant then I will send it to you [Music] um it's I feel it's bit that we have because we have so many we have nice exercises we have nice exercises but um I I like that I mean you took that you propos that because already I was thinking like what are we going to show um because there are nice exercises different thing different things but it's not about showing something that is nice for instance like with the optical flow you can create nice things and More close to technology thing you know like things that are more aesthetically appealing um but if the purpose of what we doing now is to find the audience to find your meaning or purpose when they see dance or movement happening when it's mediated through technology then the message gets more clear when just you show something and you you you portray something some message um for instance like I think in this score the way I mean there is this there's a mix between Clarity if I see this is clear somehow I mean this is clear because it's text clear um then this is not clear can you see my cursor in the I'm following yeah so this is clear I don't know clear is the word but so this is abstract oh just abstract ask around people but are seeing this is abstract or this is clear somehow I mean they have to try to make it clear well yeah it can be both it can be both but when you say clear or that's something like yeah I don't know yeah I don't like the word but but can be but I mean what I what I was trying to say is that there's the difference with this for instance like this is maybe instead of app this is more open ended I will say sure I mean the in the intro also you said you let it open ended but it's I mean it's yeah it is it is uh it's like call and response really is what uh wait is it the word yeah like call and response I mean it's it's not sure I'm not sure which is call and response but or like or questions and options let's say because the intro is more like a question that you give something question and then the video is like an option wait is that not sure I mean the maybe the way we can see it is like maybe this is objective somehow I mean objective in the sense like is a message that is passed through for them like this is something the video is something more subjective because it's for them to interpret sure [Music] um this is this is again is this objective you're you're asking people for for for them to there's a c there's a clear intention on the on the as like when you said to the people why why are these people moving why are they seeing that you cannot this this subjective for everyone is listening the same okay your action of asking is objective it's true but they will answer with a subjective yeah of course like but yeah like relation I think this score that's that's because I'm trying to see in terms of composition that there is this balance that's what I mean that's what I like from like when I read that the first time I I was feeling that there was this like CL Clarity and then exraction but do you what do you think what are you seeing but is it part of the same thing yeah I mean I think this is something I thought about this so yeah we can just cut it just put it just you can put it together there yeah so this is like8 and then yeah good and this and this this again is I see it as subjective right uh and then this part is and this is objective because because I mean they have to follow I mean they will have to interpret what they're saying right but then if you say asking around is objective because you are doing this you're giving them a task the the task being asking what are they seeing that's why you said is objective right yeah there's a Clarity there's a Clarity yeah yeah then I thought this part is also objective because you're giving a specific task to that person right are they seeing I think we should think about our perspective versus audience perspective what what do you mean so when you say objective it's like but then it doesn't work no it doesn't work oh is it I'm getting lost this is hard hard yeah no but but thing is it's a bit difficult exercise but I think maybe we don't have to finish this right now like why I mean but I think this is the intention like the intention should be clear for us right like um then we just have to Define is what we mean when we say this objective subjective or like maybe we need to find better words right so maybe we can come back on this tomorrow sure I mean or you can maybe if the idea somehow is like based on this like think on this differentiation like when I think in my head is like I was trying to use some days ago like I will like kind of differentiate when it's clear when is happening and when is not clear what is what is happening yeah I think I get what you mean yeah I I I think I get I get it from I mean from the beginning like when when you're trying to categorize them but I think the problem in this task is it depends on the perspective are we talking about our perspective or is it audience perspective and also the task can be can yeah be hybrid right that we just thought that it can be objective and subjective at the same time or maybe we just don't know what we're trying to ask no I think we should reflect and like I think we should find like a common understanding of what is like like because that would be the intention but we need to Define I think we need we need to get both in the same yeah page what is the intention yeah and this like um yeah I was like thinking about this why part so this is kind of like intention right like why are we doing this like more like overall no not just like specific task but and I was trying to like think about expanding from like what we talked yesterday but then I thought what could be like super clear from what we're doing now is this that we're trying to dance together from different place different actually even like different time because this is something clear to people how do we do how do we dance together in different how we share dance together or different time actually how we sh we in different places yeah yeah um and the rest of the part can be kept as you know up to your interpretation up up to the audience interpretation because I'm sure like if someone like a dancer sees this then they would really you know expand on it even if we don't tell much so because I mean following but like this um was in this case then the technology is helping us actually to share the feeling no like the so it's doing the opposite what of what I'm proposing as problem with technology is that it it loses that it makes problematic the empathic exchange of dance right right but that's from the point of view audience um but wait so uh here in a way is inverted this thing that is is because of the technology that we can feel we we we dance in this we try to dance in a virtual space so like we're like giving a solution because this is yeah because I think that what it makes it complicated right now at this moment is because we are speaking like I guess my I'm trying to speak from like always like right now from the point of view of the audience or like that's what I'm kind of pushing in different places um and you're mentioning something that is is concrete of of of what we doing what what you are right which makes sense but this is what we are doing like why are we doing what we are doing like because you're trying to to find ways to do this research when you are not in this when you are not in the space right so like I mean why we do this is still I mean is the way how I see it is like the why the overall why still is to help the audience to find new Aesthetics or to find new meanings when dances passes through technology yeah um but you see what I mean there's a disconnection in this one is like very meta and the other one is like what you what you speak is very is hands it's really on on a practical matter why is that we doing this why is that we decide to do this way [Music] um this is practical you know why why is that we doing this practically speaking because this is what you are not here so we have to do it in this way it will be different if you are here um so on my y if you see like up it's very meta it stills yeah I'm bit confused yeah yeah I it's a different thought of like it's a different thought yeah you know like I I I get what you mean and I was like struggling like because we have Concepts like what where you started and you know like it's really rich but at the same time it's really difficult to tell that to someone who is you know does have that that context not the context but the knowledge or you know experience in this MH and what so like coming back to you know like telling to the grandma what we do and then I thought like one thing that can be like more straightforward it to say know how can we dance together in different places for a different time but I know that it's still coming from wait what you're saying is what you're saying is true that I think that's close to the the how so one thing is we have a task to solve like or the task invitation is to work in trying to find ways where we can research how the audience can uh find new meanings uh when dance happens through digital environments right this this invitation that calls us is is that's the big capsule but then the the way to do it how to do it and I will see it because you said in your own words is was it how we do it is that we do it in this way that we are doing it now right yeah because I mean this is this is actually what it should be clear at the beginning you know this is like the intro totally yeah this is the intro and I I think it should address both points like they are completely valid like they should be way how to make the bridge between this or maybe not I don't know like um because if you see in my in my wi I put like my I underlined the problem no like say like is because the natural empathic and embodied relation between danc and a audience is partially lost when using technology I put yeah when using technology um yeah yeah the proposal like the proposal is is to help the audience to find engagement and new meanings some purpose when dance is mediated with digital environments right yeah like I'm trying to think like what how can we say this in like plain words yeah because this is really it requires a lot of knowledge I think yeah right and is this something that you actually need knowledge to understand this or is it something we could rephrase it or is there some kind of analogy and what's interesting to me is like again normally you would use like motion capture something to like reduce the body into a dot but we kind of we're like reversing this dot becomes body right I didn't thought of that that's right because we're doing the old the other way around no yeah and that's really something rich I mean still it's very technical I mean not technical but still specific specialized but but it's in response to I mean say because normally like the way how you will find more examples is like you there is some kind of input and then the dancers will do some output because it will be I mean there is is a demands more technical problems to find the motion captur in itself you know do the translation from body to motion capture is such a process that uh there is more examples of the old way around like two from having some output like some technological output then you will have the body doing something um but what I'm saying here is like in our case it comes from uh the need of what the research it is like I decided to not work with motion captured because I thought for the like what I was interested that it was working on on perception like I remember like what working with the the Avatar and the perception it just giving more troubles like well uh it was not necessary for the research uh to have a represent a digital representation of myself in the virtual reality space interesting because I think we kind of skipped that part because when you started this research you were using motion capture and you know you're also like going into avatars like you tring like VR chat and stuff but then you decided not to do it right maybe that will be interesting like to like summarize I could try I mean that was something that I was trying to do for by then is like to summarize like the in short like from where it where it comes from what is now um like the thing is like I mean something that is not I think we are missing and it's it must be mentioned is like the virtual reality must be mentioned somehow it's like because the the BR is just the extreme uh when is is the the extreme of digital uh I mean of this of this translation of of this digitalization of the body is the extreme like going to a a virtual reality environment is like the extreme that you can do in terms of perception no you go completely isolated to a place where you your sense your perception gets into a virtual world there is visually visually I mean yeah and while we are working virtually in different ways is not so drastic like it's not it's not so drastic and that's partly because of that like I don't know I think we're like doing two things like one is like it should be saying s in simple terms right oh yeah yeah I think we need some kind of like different perspective or like the problem I found now between us is we're kind of like I mean we we have same perspective well not perspective but same we we share same but we have different angle to look at it and it's really difficult to like find a I don't know how to say we have a common ground um it's just maybe it's just a words I was thinking that what if you just as an exercise you can try it for tomorrow what if you can try it like and it's specifically in the why actually what if like I I I rewrite you why with my words and you write my my why that's a great idea I think that's a good idea see like I will say we should put like some to-do somewhere like there points somehow must be touched that are not yet touched or like somehow like say why what you put is there do we have a to-do here are you ready start creating some my you see there's a folder that I'm going to go there let's put a to to do here um I think we must like the V must be clear because I think that we have a script like like we have some script that we can make it work performatively but uh it needs to be the narrative how it will be Carri out is very important um yeah so like so that their relations like the virtual reality must be somehow like it should be mentioned yeah VR why where how yes V are like explain yeah yeah I think it's it's anyway is going to come because in your text you have VR so I will write around it and although I don't have VR in my text but you will add it anyway anyways so uh but I mean this is in general and then the other thing what was it no I don't know maybe I was thinking like to like to mention the certainty like the an instability of the work but I don't think no let's just do one thing at a time yeah I mean I still think we should do something with this subjective and objective or like their perspective versus our perspective I don't know what do you mean explain that a bit something that we need this is something we need to clarify like like what what do you mean yeah can we jump back on this just for a second like to to I want to understand you what do you mean with this yeah okay so let's let's call again yeah here okay so when you say when you said like this you know you're trying to say like if it's clear or abstract or subjective objective I was trying to think like is it something that we ask question to the audience and the audience have to kind not answer but provide an option like call and response because we can't just come to the audience that we don't know so we have to ask something and the audience will respond and it's like a dialogue that goes back and forth even if it's or not literally doesn't have to be literal literally like for when I'm saying when I'm asking them I'm I'm not expecting I'm yeah I I I don't will I won't use their answers it's for is it's just to imply that they think that they answer my question on their head sure like they don't have to say it but they don't have to say it out loud but sure is the the interaction is the man of them yes yeah but so again like try to say like then the difference between objective subjective or of us and them because I I didn't understood that so the category can or the yeah the categories can be that we're asking question versus they're providing option like answering like no I think I don't get that so when we start with introduction that's something that we are asking a question I mean just trying to you know categorize them timeline you mean literally when when okay so this could be like you know question and then oh okay that's what you mean like yeah but then this is still not clear like is this watching the video is it asking question or or we can just say like what are the questions to ask but I don't know if it's no I mean something that is that I found like difficult so far also is like I haven't found like really like big questions like of like research questions and that's normally like a like normally starting point of you know how you start like researching like there's like not really I mean I have them I have some questions but I mean they're not relevant I'm not going to bring right now but right um because that I mean that is steer up like the direction how where to go with the this really want to know but I'm trying to like say it loud but um so when you do something I mean in our projects like you have question from what you've done before right or your experience say this again s so you do this you're doing I mean we're doing this project because we somehow had some kind of question in our experience that is not solved yet is not solved yet right yeah so like where in your history that led to this project or it can be simpli um I do I mean I put like the questions that I have like on this what do I want to know what do I need to know would you like to take someone would you like to see somebody dancing with a headset this I mean this is something I was trying to make in the for I mean to to do in the process as as a as a as a s survey for to hear from people and I did not I really like to see somebody dancing with a headset is important for you to interact or participate with the work or uh it's important for you to to be still uh how do you feel about the speed of things would happen is there's too much is there too much happening this was like questions in relation to a piece that is uh or like a yeah like content uh to put out yeah if I see this I think it's missing the context somehow like who would like in What scenario you want to dance with someone with headset or not is it like clubbing or is it like contact improv Jam or is it house party or is it some kind of contemporary dance or does it have to be dancing what like to interact with someone with VR headset but does have to be dancing in your question no I think it's the opposite like I mean in what I found is like in in in space like in virtual reality you have you are fine I'm fine as long as there is something happening so if I have to do something that is concrete like if I have to work if I have to move boxes from one place to the other one or if I have to chase a dragon I'm fine but if I have to dance like that's very especially if say is if it's like if there is if it's not a codification I think in general dance but in what what I'm arguing is like through a narrative you can Engage The People then in that sense is there is like I don't know then dance could be also narrative so I don't know maybe it's a ballet class so then I know what is that I'm doing I'm following or uh fitness exercise but if it's like something that is free movement as you will do in a space uh if it will suffer because I don't because I don't have the exchange with somebody else so these avatars and also especially now that I see some performances from the last week the fact that you are in a space with a VR headset and you know there is say two performers but maybe you see more than two performers two avatars and sometimes they come to you it just gives you a lot of information in your head of like um to not trust what is happening um why I started speaking this because you mentioned something because for me that was kind of clear it have to be dancing with a VR headset I mean saying like like for me like that that I see like the dancing is very complicated like to like dance contemporary dance in that abstractions shared that kind of dance in virtual reality is I found that is complicated because you don't have a body I mean yeah because you you lose the body right but I think they should be a way I think through narratives that's I mentioned that like like then this aspect of theater that it with gestures and narrative I think should be a way to find that's that's the idea of the sigils of like this interface is that I think that there should be a way to reinforce through narratives that could be help that that help the people to find new meanings because basically it's just a different meaning like but you cannot can me just following it dot that for instance like that make more sense like dance with a DOT make more sense to dance with an avatar like for me yeah yeah I think we're touching something really important but my my brain is shutting down so I just have to be honest but I think this is this is like maybe we just continue tomorrow and you know just like have yeah just try to you know like untangle everything because yeah we just have to see what led to led us to this project and like you said you know dance is complicated and this is this makes me Dan dancing virtually spaces is complicated yeah but then this kind of made me think like is it is dancing in the physical space not complicated well we just WR this there that could become a question actually why dancing in mutal space is complicated what did you said or is dance in physical space not complicated I mean I the the way I'm thinking is how does this apply to non- dancer because you're what you're saying is let's say from the dancer perspective especially when someone who has this experience in dance I mean it applies to non dancers as well but there is already like a leap because for non- dancers how would they dance and we already don't share the same experience yeah I think is that um that yeah that that can become like another level because it's the level where the audience is the dancer but like I'm I'm trying to not go there yet uh like what I'm saying is complicated is from the that as an audience is complicated to accept that somebody's dancing in front of you in Virtual space in a in a real space as an audience is is uh it's okay to accept that somebody is moving in weird ways in front of you and you might like it or you might not like it but it this doesn't it doesn't give this weird feeling that you will have in the virtual space uh that could be almost even threatening like you know there's one person with a motion capture suit but maybe you see three of them it is is is a yeah as an audience I think is yeah is I'm trying to put it from the point of view of that of the audience like I yeah and I think we should try to do that but of course like we we are we are making this and also we are also the so we are the dancers we are the performers but also we are the creators so we are creating the idea we are performing the idea but we want to think what the audience think basically that's that's my proposal like normally like I mean it should be surveys you know like a survey like a form like with the that's I mean that's some point I plan it but I never did it maybe really ask we could do the exercise of like making personas but I don't exactly know what but yeah like who are the audience members what kind of experience they have that you want to visit this sharing because I think we're kind of talking about abstract audience but yeah we don't like now at this point like yeah that there is yeah could like there is like the audience like as nuto audience you know could be a programmer who is there who has like some level of knowledge but not really I just um and could be the my grandma that is there also because she wants to visit and see it yeah I mean we don't have to make it super elaborate but just to have a vag idea of like what we're talking about as an audience yeah in that sense like now yeah but that kind of worked like in that sense like naoto knows the programmer has heard or experienced sometime some things and my grandma has no idea right it's kind of like like it really knows more it has some experience and doesn't know at all like there there's these three levels of persona I just put it here do that make sense yeah and we just you know so and then we constantly doing this then we can ask like that so persona persona one uh all the ghost person two P2 um um programmer E3 I mean if I would add one is like an artist or can answer actually a dancer yeah that not artist but um I don't know name I I shouldn't we should have M here I don't know someone else is the ghost um but I will say then then and they how much they know my god look bre so uh there's no so now so Nick knows four% of this or five let's say I don't know the program knows how much two of this if the maximum is five but then should okay so this Dance Tech and also there's dance and Tech I mean dance is a second category right and then Tech is also another category but Dance Tech is actually a separate thing it's not about just multiplying dance and Tech but let just say like how much they know about the field yeah the so this guy knows very well so this is the maximum five things say this programmer how much will know actually just well like programmer in terms of like like it person no curator programmer as cator oh curator yeah well then I would one more plus just to be nice to that person okay so then one more and then the dancer two two and then my grandma one of course your Grandma knows everything she knows everything but she doesn't know dance t uh okay but this is okay this could be now we have a to-do yeah and it's title font okay so we open this thing is a bit it's a bit I will say let's come back tomorrow then and then we go back to the pract Practical thing we try to see if we can make run or like what do we need to to make it run uh because then then we have to start thinking practically also need to think like do I need to move the computer do I need to ask something there uh so we start with the Practical thing and then we start talking on uh so we have the exercise of like rewrite the Y from the other one so I will rewrite your why my words question we need to find something there about questions oh stop you need to make the video like the the the upload the video that is only three minutes I think oh yeah I I made one for myself um oh this [Music] and I will say like from now when we like it could be like an like a constant thing like uh if there are questions that you can think like in relation to what is that we're doing like like for instance in relation to the audience you know like so but like what so that question I think could be like what audiences need to be engaged with Dan that could be a question like we have questions because I think that can help this is this is I guess this is the main thing that I'm being repeating in different way right but I think it's also important that uh maybe tomorrow we work more on the personas because otherwise we don't know who we are talking about so that we expand the Persona thing I think it would make sense because they because you want to know what they need right right you want yeah okay because we're still it's still abstract like we're talking about you know abstract no I I just put it like this like how much level of knowledge but no it's true let's do the exer what do they need what the personal need actually okay yes still we have time like and now we have a score like now so we just need to clarify yeah and I think it's good to just keep it how do I say yeah like work on the core of it otherwise if we just keep adding things people don't get it because we don't get it either no does the thing we have to get it yeah yeah but it's nice we have so many exercise help we should put we should put up like at the list I mean that they can see different examples you make a playlist like there was a playlist where they can see the other exercise three so what's the homework I mean the task for the the to do is to rewrite the Y of each other and explain V somehow the V should come there in the text yeah we just keep stick to this right yeah and the prac this is something we talk next time about the Practical stuff and Tech writer like what we need for the presentation but this is we're going to talk next talk I guess yeah we just need to talk on yeah what it how it's going to be like this the stage design right sign make Talk video I think the make Talk video will happen when we are a bit more in depth of this I mean when we clarify a bit yeah then but it's all we're a bit confused right now but I think it's fine we can be confused right now because it's fine confused we know that we are confused yes it's worse if we don't know we're confused but we're actually confused then you know yes we a bit ahead well okay good night I'm gonna but I'm gonna read also this and if I found something is relevant I might just I send it to you yeah cool now I'm gonna go and buy some food great good night thanks good have a nice evening and see you tomorrow tomorrow", "ObhX7xUXgCQ": "oh my God okay the drama this is a noela and I think it's like your face of like this is this kind of meeting like at that time like I wouldn't like today I was following the last week I was not following at all anything but I'm following now yeah and and thanks so much like it was really like yeah you are really good yeah because like I'm following now like the because like I was more yeah so I think it's really clear and yeah yeah it's kind of uh it's clear we need what the only so so what is clear is by December we need to clar so we need to give them dates uh wait so what in December we need to what we have to do in December for December we have to tell them if you're coming you have to say like if you're coming in February try to say that y like we have also can we put it somewhere the document that is clear yeah I just put it like bold letters okay my arrival yes my arrival if the auto can come in in February um and decide we have to decide also if we want to do it in cedral or Cal is the huge place no yeah or the small one it's this one M um which I mean this also could be a thing it seems it could be a negotiation like I mean this can be a conversation that can be still open but will be good if they they if they know um what else uh that's the only homeworks they will get back to us if the space is available in August right like before so like now it's clear like in August we will be there from 18 I'll I'll put it here otherwise not say August so from 18 of August till 1 of September um M 18 bill first of September in Lana yeah so that's clear and then they will try he will try to find somewhere to put other two weeks before that that that would be great like that will be great yeah [Music] um uh wait can I like can I need to be can I be back in two minutes I need to be yeah just take your time yes was a bit cold so wait like so this is so we will talk tomor about what are we going to do I guess in the in the in the hybrid with the team yeah with the team um that's Nuno and Will William tomorrow okay um I start seeing that that uh since we are here until in this place until January we need to see how like especially we have to come back and think on this like if we gonna use the Paratus because here have the theater aparatus like the possibility to maybe put some of other things um um we have to come back on that afterwards um right but okay uh this is kind of like conversation of like a meta conversation and and this is part of more like the what Modina project because there a performance that I think we are building I think we can build a performance um now we're focusing through this presentation like the place that we are could be almost like a scene within that performance like what we're gonna present here in the next week okay yeah this is this is part of the interaction [Music] um and could be I was even thinking that I really what I like from from your from the the displacement what was the the the line that you show me how isn't this called this effect and the web page that you shent me with the camera that it looks like UB coordinates moving the optical flow or no the optical flow yeah what I like from that is combin it with the with the darkness of the space that's something that somehow can work um I'm thinking for instance like maybe in a simple way I'm thinking that if in the space where are you you're here if in this space so there is like a backgrounding uh no I'm actually thinking just here so there is one big screen here uh and the biggest screen screen could be projecting a webcam position I don't know a webcam position a webcam that is watching the the the audience so the audience will be there I guess somewhere and because of the darkness I mean then there's a a trick of how to put not too much light so then there is no not much image changing for the webcam um and could be that it's always wait I'm mixing things so like I'm just saying that one way to start putting this is I would like maybe if they start by doing invite the people to do the exercise of following the hand for instance I mean the following the Pathfinder with their hand uh and also then following with their body in the space so just saying right now um and then project the output into that screen that so not not there because then it becomes too much like I don't like I would like that is just subtle yeah because you don't want like this I don't want they because they will get just too much too too interested on on on that yeah not on that maybe I can just try myself actually today to see uh I thought like it would be fun if we could do like delay but you know one minute delay one minute delay yeah the optical flow or the or what or yeah something with the interaction because it will come back right the Pathfinder will come back after one minute yeah yeah yeah but I don't know if that's we should just try that will be interesting to do but okay so maybe I can try to do that today wait what I'm trying to think is I don't want to make this over complicated so at the end I guess what what I want to show for next week is just a selection of some videos uh uh and with the some short of in saying of why is uh what is the interest of this how is related to to what I'm doing here um why I'm [Music] thinking yes I think it's I think it's really fun to like play with this idea that you know I told you like when I was doing the exercise in the studio like others were thinking think that you know I was looking at myself with the phone like instead of just Pathfinder because I was holding a phone and I was recording my movement and they trying to think you know what was happening on the phone which was just the dot that was moving but they try to think you know like it was actually sending video from there to hear because I was recording with another camera another phone well like they were trying to figure out yeah was was happening and like trying to complicate it that's like the reason why we tried to do it also well one of the reasons why you were doing it with the VR headset for example and um also I sent you um I told you like I told this about about this to Max Max Ley and he like when I shared the video of us in the grid he thought at first um because I was again holding the phone he thought it was the video of you moving with the headset so I was trying to copy your movement yeah I mean what is interesting is is that they just give people have to give they have to interpret they have to to give meaning of what is happening right right and I think that's interesting starting point and then know to reveal that at first but try you know like make them think what is happening yeah yeah um then will be like like I feel that like the phone because I can do it in in VR right because I feel I should should use at least something with a VR um but I mean maybe I don't have to if um maybe it could be that I just do it in VR one time and then I just do with the phone one time it's just it's just a different medium of the same thing right or you could just show the video yeah I mean that's something we we should use at some at some point yeah I think like I think the idea with the video is that it just simplifies I mean it just makes things yeah it simplifies something I mean you you know what is it like I don't know what will happen if I do it in the space you know right yeah I don't know it might not work um but also that I was thinking to be honest like that's another point that I think I would like to highlight because this is what it connects with those practices and that was part of like in the conversation that we were having the Symposium is is this the error the glitch working and not knowing and that's something that I was trying to underline some point in this conversation is like we are ahead in this place we have been working and we have we give meaning we are very comfortable not knowing what to do right um and that's something that uh I think it should come also there but then it should come there but it should be clarified like not only doing but you should I mean that's what I mentioned like this the lecture the idea of the lecture in my head is it's just clarifying doesn't have to be a lecture but it just clarifying somehow like for instance like before doing something that uh if you give them some command like if I tell you please move your hand from and follow the dot in uh and don't think too much of what you're doing so if you have to do it with the right with the left if you want to move more your body or left your body is all fine so just move don't think too much and then just be in the space and U and follow the dot [Music] um don't think too much if you're doing it good or wrong and if you don't understand what you're doing it's fine just try to follow the flow and be in the space I mean this is just to say like that to underline somehow like the the not knowing um is good um I see I'm saying I'm saying I'm saying that choosing to select videos especially when you're working in this GD could be great because then it's just a matter of you and me then we decide what to show especially if we said it's going to be 20 no more than 30 minutes for sure counting the people come inside and outside I will say it's 20 minutes of material 10 minutes of before and after so then we have to really smart in what we're selecting and already we have things that we can maybe like just we just have to start selecting and and work in the that's what I was mentioning like working in the narrative or of a way to present this in a way that's um concrete yeah it doesn't have to be good it just it has to be Concrete in in in in in the doing why are you showing yeah why are you showing this so if why are you showing this yeah there a question a question yeah yeah why yeah because I want the audience to experience to see that there's that they can interpret uh that everybody will interpret very differently um that everybody the audience will give a different meaning or it will they will do something different everybody will do something differently slightly different from a clear pattern um like in this case in this cases is this way what I'm saying here is a bit tricky and it's connected with in the simposium we're talking of this here we have something that is clear like P finder is clear is a binary thing the rules how to play with this this is something that I can that I cannot articulate very well here maybe you can help me with this because I go back and forth is so Pathfinder is binary and it's clear but then when you talk about playing um or repeating a score like but then you put it in the in the in the realm of playing because they were talking about like VR games and VR stuff then playing is possible and it's fun when you I mean you can follow completely rules you can be strictly follow you can really go in extreme of following rules of playing and then the game is clear and then everybody and and go completely to that real of playing following really clear rules example if we said we're going to represent Pathfinder and you're very clear you said it's only the right hand it's only the right hand who moves and follow with the dot um and and and then you can start putting more uh more things in in that rule no like if you want to follow when it's up left you have to reset the movement I mean you can be more clear as yeah uh you can try to put many rules at that right but but like sorry let me try to finish this so like rules could be really like really strict and harsh um but also could be just maybe a a playground for things to be interpreted which I think will be more useful in the in the digital in the digital space um so like going back to like trying to answer what you said I think what you would like is that the people see that that they could that everybody can interpret differently uh as core like or like yeah the symbol I don't know they can interpret very differently something that is right objectively the same yeah you know like like yeah and I think you touched it it a little bit but why is this important because I think is is in that space of difference that they find meaning that they will find there is something for them uh it will be for instance that my appreciation that it will be only that you follow with your right hand for 10 minutes for maybe for 30 minutes the dot only with your right hand you need to start finding something in you need to find more purpose in that like uh if you're repeating a just one command it just becomes boring it's not challenging it's not giving you something so um I see but I think it but I mean to me the reason why we do this um you know like I don't want to use this word so much but you know connects to Like A diversity and you know it's not like single value like that's why people find different meanings right so like we're not saying that you know what is good or bad what what is the way we should use technology or we could yeah expand to that you know like like we don't want to say like this is the way we use technology but we can diverge everyone has different ways to use it and that's to me that's like what's interesting right so that you know it's not like yeah like there is no single way to do it it's not the best way to do it there is yeah there is no such a thing that there is no best way to do it and people are often afraid of computers because you know you have to do it the right way otherwise it will break and if you know this is the instruction you can't break it or actually you are everyone is breaking it because you can't strictly follow the thought you're not a machine everybody will do it differently so it's it's from the difference because of the difference that it makes it interesting right I'm thinking that I don't know it might not be actually practical but think could be really not for now but for instance like in a piece if you record the people I think it will be interesting if you're proposing exercise in the space and you're recording the people and then you let them see that afterwards that basically they will find this is exactly what happens that happens with us I mean with with adults like the same thing happens with kids that you have this giggling you know uh if if the recording if there is a recording of you doing something uh and then there is the projection of that you will be you find this as a child like you find that as funny and then you will see yourself in the space I mean saying that that's a that's a way to basically show that that you're saying without the need to say too much you know like you're recording the people something and then you show them what they did basically right but the problem I mean we should try that but also like I can see that the problem is that people judge if they see themselves right if someone's doing better or worse or you know I mean there are so many distractions is not just good or bad but the form that I but this is also interesting to connect to you know where you started you know because if we see bodies moving then we judge a lot if it's a DOT you don't really judge well I would but what you wearing well how high how the height are wearing wearing glasses is the movement big small so many things that distracts that the dot dot is just dot it's a pure thing yeah it's pure yeah in this this yeah yeah more conceptual thing but yeah no but I think it's like it's interesting like that I think that's the work that we have to do is like to simplify this that we are saying and that's why I think it's perfect like to work with just this G and Dot in one minute because if we understand we're not yet like we cannot yet um articulate in a way that is kind of is clear we are like we are but I think that's the work that we have to do is that we need to find a way to um you know because this is the second time you're asking why do you want to do this you know like we should find a common a common ground like what is that you want to [Music] do um and one of the points is like it should be clear the intention should be clear at least uh and I think that was I thought was with with Anton this idea The Narrative of the dramaturgy that I'm lacking I guess then we will need to find then somebody who can help us the then let's say for the kinosis or also to advance because The Narrative of the dramaturgy should come um uh so what we need to we need to find Clarity uh on what is Our intention what is the overall intention of what we want to do it should be clear for us um totally so but that it should still give space enough for the people to doubt themselves alth I mean that's the that's the the magic of like uh an example that Anon was giving like what he saw a performance he said like the performance was basically you go to work so it's a building and it's a kind of a large situation so you go to work and then you're doing work basically and then basically in time you you evolve in this in your company but then we think this is these things happening sometimes you're really somebody tell at some point uh a woman came to say like to gossip about the company so he put him in in this space uh of of if it's real or not uh and at some point also he said at some point a woman came he was laying down in the bed with a woman like half naked and then she said like uh can you please take me out of here like it will it will play with his mind he didn't know what was real and what was not real because physically he was doing something that he know he was playing but from time to time it gives him space to were it was with his mind too much so he was very playful in that sense uh uh so the audience didn't know what was happening uh in that space um but that was the intention like the overall intention I guess of the piece was giving that back and forth and that's something somehow that I would like to find [Music] um I don't know how but this is I mean this is what I meant like it should be serious but not so serious like how much I mean what I'm saying that maybe is like this is not for now because I don't really understand yet also that how uh or this is this is I think it's part of a different conversation I mean but we need it right I mean sorry the sound is getting a bit uh glitchy I don't know why I can't hear you well sometimes but maybe I just thought I don't know if it's a good idea or not but we could also you know say that the homework today is to just come up with what we do on the seventh yeah what what are we presenting like say we have 20 minutes and the material we have what we do okay so let's let's put here so there's 20 minutes I'll put here so 20 minutes desent so what do we do what do we present what else you have been ask I think there something that I would like to come back I guess every day maybe or at least like now you're asking what what do we want with this is that is that a question yeah did I ask I don't know what you ask like I think like you said today what do we want with this what do you want with this yeah or what is this for yeah what or what's important for you or I don't know like what's do you want to tell or I don't know what was a question I don't know what what do you want to say it or like yeah what is the message message I me message I don't like that word so much but what yeah I mean what is this what is this yeah well what do we do is that concrete thing right what do we do in 20 minutes yeah so this is practical actually right yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah why but then why why is a good question yeah normally I mean let's just this could be a which this is a good way to go around this like why how and what so they I mean how and what is kind of in this case it's the same thing but this could be like to clarify I mean like so wait so the what what do we do no because there's a difference like what is electri performance or a performance or I guess somehow it's more like the the the physical material thing say it's um Electro performance and then how is how then is how to break down that the Practical thing like how you you will do it like you use projection a series of videos and then a small presentation at the beginning middle at end sure okay I will put it like likeor performance like there should be a different a better name performance but I think for now it works because people will understand what is that Som some BDS BDS and small small score or the people other way like uh performer to small score these are the possib possibilities like sure I mean I think we could just work on our own and then come back tomorrow yeah okay let's let's do this as an exercise yeah do it okay good yeah and then we come back and let's yeah let's do that and practically I think I will try to do that I will try to do that exercise of uh can you do the let's do the the Google Maps recording yeah and I think I will try I would like to try the to [Music] see yeah I will do the the Pathfinder but you can do also the same maybe we can do that like what if you do the the Pathfinder with your hand but use like like try to use a really low light so there is not too much Movement Like sorry in Optical flow like use the optical flow to do a Pathfinder but try to it's almost like the your light conditions are really low so that there is not too much motion actually I see because that that's based on that's based on change of image know like the pixels when the pixels move then they I don't know it look is is that based on U coordinates because they look like UV coordinates or is not the the the sketch normal map no no it's I me normal map it looks like you could kind of like make it intertwine but it's not that it looks it looks like that it looks there their normals um right but yeah double like just do this exercise like the low life conditions um Pathfinder with Optical flow Optical FL yeah for tomorrow let's do that okay and then we come back tomorrow all right uh we have this meeting with them at three yeah same time yeah okay let's try to meet like a two hour try to be or maybe if I do it from home even like with the to me before yeah that would be better for me yeah yeah I'll will try but I will let you know okay great okay I I like and then then just go back to the what how and why yeah so the two things that and this is conceptual con and this is practical yeah practical okay great thanks a lot good night", "UmrmMh9xW_M": "hey hello hey oh wait why is it not connecting to my headphones let me see oh I thanks okay so it's been a while yeah like two days yes miss you so much who is there so far today was a lecture well yesterday today I I give a presentation in a seminar and today was uh official lecture in another school and it was um it was pretty fun so I noticed when I gave a presentation yesterday I really suck at talking in Japanese yeah I can imagine wow yeah doing the same in Spanish will be right now very complicated yeah and it's actually like for me it's easy to just like just talk like continuously in Japanese and like I can easily like lose the structure like it just like goes go on and on and on so yeah today I decided to use my cards I brought my cards and then um I set the rule that I shuffle it reveal one card and talk about it maximum three minutes so so I can't go too long that sounds like like yeah that's a structure yeah yeah so it was also a bit like a performance was really fun and yeah I think it worked well yeah yeah yeah yeah and maybe on that on that point like maybe I I think I would like to then we going somewhere else then we both are on the same page because to start thinking on time wise for me like the to know like like now I'm counting I think there are 15 days from now that I have to present something we have to present something here like somehow so I will suggest that by we have this call on Monday and then we have this call on Tuesday I will say like that on Tuesday we start I mean we need to uh already start basically I think repeating we have to talk on the on a setup that we are like repeating so I mean that we have to just from I would like from Tuesday that we start working on something that it should be I mean that's what we're going to show here we are so we have these days still to experiment uh but then from Tuesday meaning I guess we will like Tuesday we'll see how tired we are but then on Wednesday we have to start working on the setup itself I see yeah because then we'll be then like eight days basically from Wednesday working days so we have to smart like so I think yeah we yeah so then from but I'm put it here like from so from Tuesday also because then we will know what happens also with Modina then we can start basically thinking on something I mean doesn't have to be G everything in a stone but that we can repeat basically and then becomes the the sharing what is the sharing so far is not clear right okay cool um so let's go jump back to time space that was the last [Music] um I put some things so you said did you read both text that I Shar with you the first one I didn't check the second one yet what was the second about check I don't know you sent to right this donter college Learning Resource Center PDF I haven't read that one I read the space time oh yes yeah that was interesting like with this what was the interesting thing on this I think I put it in my other notes let me check um why yeah I don't know I will come back on that maybe I will do something now I think we have to do something also with this the notes but for now it's because I'm having not somewhere else and I think since this is kind of becoming one thing maybe we can Bridge it somewhere else but for now I think I will just share a link to the what the log where I have listings then then if at some point there is something specific then can jump there yeah wait uh I'll just put it here how do I do the the blog thing wait you just put paste the link first I paste the link just no so no don't make it hyperlink but just put link as URL ah so I put the link as URL yeah ah okay and then you just select it with a cursor and then it should pop up no yeah this like at the bottom say replace URL chip Link in the blue bar like when it's pops up doesn't work I see it on my browser so right click on the link no no just just click just normal click oh replace URL wait chip chip okay oh wow it okay good um project check if you can have if you have access to that because then I have to Grant you access otherwise yeah I see it okay cool Lo yeah so I basically I'm there like expanding a little bit of things that there are in the other place but bit more expanded I see let's go back maybe let's go back to the for now like to here and then I thought today the before establish put it here put it here that before going to the digital virtual space is important to Define uh like or to establish Concepts from what is dance what is reality um yeah somehow like from the my perspective like uh how yeah um yeah in order to keep on uh yeah to to get deeper in the conversation right [Music] so I mean in a way what I'm what I'm saying is that like that the dance that that I'm interested is dance that doesn't deal with representation and that unfolds in present time it hold abstractions or um it abstractions enigmas and a cipher with a symbolic character that is possible only through the embodiment that it happens at the exchange between the audience and the dancer meaning that this place that is abstract the dance it's I mean as an audience we hold it and we accept it uh so enigmatic and so abstract because it doesn't car representation as it will carry normally in ballet or in theater or in other forms we accept it because we from the embodiment or just for the act of being in the same space basically with the danc yeah so what I'm so and the problem is when you try to make it uh then in digital spaces you don't have that body uh like in the digital space you don't have the possibility to share the same space right that's what we talked some days ago like that that's what it it makes it not I mean that kind of dance is just it it it's difficult to make it because if you're holding something is not really concrete is uh and you accept it because you are in the same space once you are in another space you don't hold embodiment so symbolic you cannot like it's difficult to uh yeah it's just becomes a different thing like it's empty it's just a figure yeah yeah exactly yeah so that was just like establishing that so like then I mean it just put a bit of like that um now maybe we can go back to we wanted to talk about the last thing we talk about a bit of time right and the yeah we talked about past and future yeah the future the focus in the way we we were trying to think in future which I didn't really thought about it but I was I was interested in the in the future aspect of time but something that there was in this text that I thought it was I think he was using something of what is the words he used like the I mean I mentioned this as a before as a the difference between universal time and a personal time so the times that happens yeah the time that is universal for everyone and this next to a mechan as a as a as a matrix as well as a reference point to basically do different things so yeah and the other one that is a personal time that is different how we perceive through our Consciousness the time and in the text they mention as a um well if I remember correctly that the analogy was that the universal time is align uh with segments where I think literally where literally like the yeah time with segments while the personal time was something more that it comes in waves that expands and contracts depending of your of your experiences so in relation to I think to what we are working at was thinking how can we I don't know if it's if when the time contracts is because where you are engaging in something and then [Music] um is it when when time when things happen and you feel them as boring is um you perceive time as long no is it like like stretched stretch right I mean okay like in general in general always yeah let's let's assume that like when so time uh so I'm [Music] wa um I want to doal personal waves long and short long when they bored I don't know and short when you're engaged ow no meaning let's put it more no meaning meaning short meaning yeah how [Music] to put actually sorry need yeah to have a meaningful experience with the L about the short this time what what did you thought about the text what what it stays with you the text um how do I say like it's something I didn't expect is they really talk about the stage right or like a performance like it's not it's kind of like um I didn't grasp the whole thing I mean like details but I guess the idea is that taking this physics and applying it into performance in a way like how can you frame that on the stage right so like they're not they're not trying to make a time machine like like time travel like in real life but like how can you do it in on the stage in a way but there were so there was some points also interesting like they were mentioning like the difference between yeah like the difference between mystery and Enigma like that they said like in a performance then you would like I mean that the difference like a mystery something that cannot be solved while an enigma is something that is resolved so uh uh say like as designer you have to work like in a way H mystery will be close to a black box so a designer as a technician like things must be working in a blackbox people do should not have to question about it um while the Myst the Enigma will be more close to the dramaturgy or the meaningful experience so that the person need needs to find interest in in what is happening so that it should partly resolve the pule yeah like the nigma because it's in that it once it does that then it finds purpose to do it if the person I think that was something also coming I don't know in which text was coming coming I think it's in complexity they speak like um they put an example of playing tennis um if you put a p so a tennis player they have two actors right so A and B like then both players if a is too good uh then will be a I mean from the point of view of the audience and also from the players it's boring because a will just win and the other way around if a is too bad is too boring for the other perspective like what is complex is to find that when both have more or less a similar set of skills then both are engaged and playful yeah I think that was you know way these are the words uh what is the what is the the what is the encounter where what is happening stays playful um and challenging I don't know if that was in text you sent me no no no but I know I think but I know I that comes but I think they use it more with the with the allegory of the mystery and the and the Enigma I think the way of they men that is that they should that the person the audience needs to feel that he solving a puzzle so if the thing is so the thing is completely abstract you lost them they lose interest yeah that was in text yeah yeah so I the connection between the two two things that it must be a Cross Point what is enigmatic and then you but sometimes they understand what is happening yeah otherwise you lose them so it must be at this border of being challenging for them to find what is happening um which make me makes me also reflect a bit on uh of the fact that in a way what we are researching I was thinking is kind of close to theater is used to work a lot with this things you know like the Contemporary theater I mean I'm not I don't know about that much but theater plays a lot with dis utions like uh uh there are people like I don't know I know like in history I think they mentioned here also like Samuel Becket and he wrote a a book or a theater piece with basically I think it's called waiting for the doter I don't know if you heard of that piece the whole thing is that there's a like what is happening is the for a long period in in theater is the person is waiting for something that never comes so it's concrete so because the person is waiting and they use language and all these uh symbolic uh things but nothing is happening so theater has this I will say like ways to play Kind of Magic in that uh in that sense there's history through that I mean what I'm saying is that so yes please interrupt me I I I like this reference uh what was the book uh in this text uh I don't know how to pronounce this finigan wake oh yeah yeah that was interesting I mean I didn't know and I just took a look at the book did it's like a I I bought the Audi book I wanted was like 25 hours oh okay and it's like gibberish but it's it's like giberish but also it's sometimes makes sense kind of oh yeah yeah yeah oh fine it makes yeah because it was when they they started speaking about like the malic malevich square and right W there's a lot of things lag I just putting up the text can you put also next to it the can you find my Lage Cube um I just share the window so I need to share screen AIO spell square I'm trying to find the book that they said wow this is the first part of the book I didn't read yeah I mean should we read read loud maybe we should read it River run past Eve and Adams from swerve of shore to bend of bay bring us a commodious beus of recirculation back to hold castle and [Music] environs Sir Tristram viol de for over the short sea had passent core reared

was the scene ring Sone of the aqua face I don't know we should go through next I think what I wanted to mention from this is it could be interesting like as something what I think I wanted to mention of this but I don't know if it was exactly like this at some point in the text that we're mentioning while here it say like while malevich black Square to the left is a paintly a pent Singularity uh finans wake is the literally one so I the semantic of language have rment remain intact but they have been recombined and without the key to its impenetrable code it has become inaccessible um I think because I cannot find it here but I I remembered in somehow like they were make they were mentioning this was in relation to time and space not that in the text uh in Wake so in the text that Joyce found a way to break time uh that is only possible to find after I mean they yeah after one reads like that should be an insistent in time to try to Cipher the code so a linear way of reading of uh it won't work uh that sense like that they were speaking more on time on this like he found the time to break time while the in malich what they were interested was that they speak as a singularity like the space is all condensing that so I think that the text we speaking more about time that is break and the and the malish square is a space who is it is break because it's is everything condensed in that space okay and I think if I'm not wrong that I think the the black I think the way who it was done is it was by I think there are scratches like I mean there's just a scale up of uh maybe we can put like how was how was done I know there's another image this but this looks just like you know um how I say not the fracture but like just dried out it looks like yeah just trying out but at some point also they were trying to mention also like some bovin one of Masterpiece of bovin and they were trying to set like how to make in in a moment I don't know if they say anything about the process oh there's there's Red Square as well oh that looks like a nice exhibition this is really cool when it was exhibited like this looks amazing as an exhibition what what I like from what I'm uh what I'm trying to go from try to find from here is that they found the I mean the it's very symbolic the the square is very symbolic right um I mean it represents totality uh um Singularity um and in the in the text I think they were mentioning that when you try to find like the super like the you try to do the same with a with a Ban's piece and trying to find one note in like that represents uh the Fifth Symphony said then it won't work because I mean what you will perceive is is just I don't know a pitch that it won't give you the depth of what the painting does and in uh because it needs the it needs time to unfold music needs that time to [Music] unfold and I think it needs Yep this is maybe something I was thinking when we talked about future um because obviously like we can't predict future but if something is repeating then we can kind of predict future because we know what's coming next right so it's kind it can be like daily routine you know we wake up and you know you know you're going to go you know cook breakfast or go to school or you go to the academy or whatever and then you have lunch and you have dinner and go to sleep so you know like more or less like in one minute one hour you know what's coming because it's repeating but then we were talking about loops like so but why the loops that like you music is also loops or like it has the beat that you know that it's coming and then you can shift it to um not deform but um modulate or distort time because there's Baseline that is repeating or you have the temple that it's you know that it's coming wait okay um you're saying we have to come back to the the link actually yeah okay yeah I'll go to PN then I come back y hear me yes recording I think you were mentioning something interesting with the with music I don't know from where I get this but uh I think the way how why music is universal is because always you are in the future I mean always you are um wait like uh like the way how tonality works like you know if you're in tone it's because you feel somehow like I mean you can perceive the tone and jumping into the tone uh I think in the middle of your brain somehow um so you know that you are in tone when you are like trying to catch a note is it's a physical manifestation that you feel when you are in tone so with music I think it has to be connected but you're saying because it goes in Loops you are always ahead yeah or you know what's coming next somehow as and it's actually embodied is an embodied or the brain yeah if it's if it's like abrupt it you will feel the discomfort in your in your body if you're in certain way looping then if something is really abrupt you will feel it drastically in your body right [Music] yeah and it happens in different scales right like you can say that this beat is just repeating but also you can compose it into four three or four or eight or it can be more like a verse for example yeah pop music what what do you mean say it again I think I did I lost so so what you just said is more like a beat that like there's like a Tempo that you know that you know it's coming it's coming it's coming but then it can be multiplied by four 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 that's all also repetition right or it can be even bigger like you know you have two verses three verses like two choruses that also like repeats after some time so you have like different scales of repetition in music it can be like less than a second into like one minute the loops itself like the duration of the what yeah what Loops yeah yeah I'm thinking now I like to do and what we did was not a loop right I mean the only Loop we did was like we did twice same video with Pathfinder but the Pathfinder itself is not repeating the algorithm is repeating but it's not like maybe it's not was not embodied like music can can you play the video Yeah by finder like the one that we have yeah I'm going to look for it yeah I guess what one thing we could do is like study this Loop so I guess what we trying to do some like we should break down more the process than we are I think uh okay so put it again yeah the video can restart it again yeah somehow it doesn't feel repeating I know that algorithm is you know it's timed it's repeating the instructions but not the same way that you know we perceive music no I mean it's a loop is a a it's a 10 minutes Loop right this but if you look into the program it's just repeating with random sequence right what it does okay you mean like yeah one of the things that I think it happens in music you is through like when you count there is an entrance no you say one two three one two three one there is like a there is always like there is there is an intention it Che when it makes it clear that you enter the first one you said and one two three one two three you you have this intention right and this is doesn't feel like this here at all it's quite no um what I'm thinking that is that there is a lot of information on this um it makes you think but it's too much no like I mean it's too much um I'm thinking that maybe it's a bit like um I'm gonna do something then I just put it in the I'm going to Loop it until the minute one MX yeah okay then let's use this same video what is the video okay do you have a way to Loop it there until the minute one like just Loop the first minute um I mean no I mean I just I can't do it else I can just put it here it's easy so this is the video that we want right and then we wanted to until minute max value um what is this body see two right okay okay uh can I share my screen should be allowed now where is call share screen share just this window okay now are we seeing both yeah so it starts over so you notice now that there's a yeah there was that was a one minute Mark but maybe it was because uh I mean I think it was too easy because there is the I mean you see the circle and I guess that's what [Music] .8 ah okay we still see the the beginning right the jump yeah what what is that that's the beginning yeah because yeah that's the beginning but then I can put this from Zer three seconds I guess yeah because you don't know where it ends up and where it starts again you still see this why okay let's put it from there can you see the what yeah because it just jumps CU you don't know where it ends and where it starts hero 10 why is not do this is a weird artifact I I could look into the code if I can make it after one minute it goes back to the origin that's the problem we're having I think that's what what is the line the one what I'm trying to get away from here is the line so like the beginning of the video doesn't have the I mean it could be something like artifact when I recorded I don't know but if so anyway then I should be able to Max okay okay go now try to see like now it jum okay so now I think we cannot perceive the jump right I mean you canot see this like so now it's about to finish now it it that was a loop okay yeah you saw like there was a jump it jumps yeah because you don't know where it ends it has to end let's say at the origin like where it started but it's random so it can't control you mean so like then you will that you what that's what I wanted you wanted to do like to yeah what I can try is for example like after one minute it always come back as a point in the middle for example then maybe we can Loop it easily because right now we don't know where it ends after one minute and then we yeah and then then it will jump yeah and then what I was doing is more like yeah in the video but yeah no okay but this gives more structure I think I like more what you said that every minute the point will come back to the center yeah and we just cut the video so that it's just one minute always do the same thing back to Center yeah maybe can we do one thing I guess before so yes like so if you can do that but I want to try one thing so then I think I have to I have to share my screen do um share so you see my whole screen right yes I can see okay um what is this this vdmx right oh okay you're doing vdmx see I can make bigger this how to make this bigger well okay I know for now uh can we maybe let's do the what I'm trying to achieve with is can you move only your left hand to like do the extracise just with with left hand can we do now then both only when only when the so I'm only when move so follow the do Pathfinder only when it goes right and down and I will do it only when it goes up and left right and down and down and then I will do it when it's left and right so wait but then what does that mean actually so wait right so like so for instance like left it's always I guess it's tricky because it can be left so down you do it or you keep it okay I do it I can do it you can rotation yes or no I guess depends like rotation depends no because from but from a point of view like if you do uh this movement the thing is like it's just one is one point so this movement will be up and at the same time down so right ah so up up down no left up wow okay this is tricky I think I will suggest that we do it separated and then we record it so then we that we record so left left so left up and left up and right down like aart no like not at the same time like just left left doing so like now this I don't move there wow this becomes almost like a Pula and it's just left yeah but I I didn't are you doing like two hands or just one no just one hand that's that's just I think right now it's just one hand the left one or it could be like show like your right so right hand but the right hand can only move let's do it like maybe right now at the same time I would like can I make your my oh yeah okay sorry now I can just now I'm see can you see yourself bigger there because now I'm sharing my screen no yeah oh me it's it's still small for me you and also the problem is like we're mirrored somehow well I'm mirrored or you're mirrored or I don't know this is getting more complicated right now okay exercise like so now but are you seeing the square right the lines yeah lines I me the line wait I can do I I mean I can record this and then I can send it to you just the screen because now I see yourself bigger oh so that we don't do the screen sharing but we have synchron Som oh we just say we start I'm not thaning too much right now because I also no let's capture let play Capture okay and then send the [Music] transform streen okay good all right so let's try this thing so we both do wait am I recording a a test one one yes yes recording Al so we do it now I will tell you yeah here we just do it I mean now and then after I mean for now let's just do it now like that with the right hand so with the right hand we boot we move because it will I think it will have a different interpretation what I'm saying sure like we move the right hand when the when there is movement left up that's you both we both we do it we both with both left up yeah up okay now I have to flip it okay so this is the beginning left out that you know what I think uh it should be even there should not be a line like there should be a point right now yeah like we should try like make so we don't have this or like this I mean I think that that's that's interesting that's that's because it or we have to clarify it of become something but right now I think just maybe make the sketch there is just one point randomly degreed yeah and I think I made it so that another version that comes back to the center after one minute so I can make a video Loop yeah yeah yeah just one minute yeah of so the point going everywhere yeah this just a video Loop of the point going everywhere um and we moving when there is up and up and left but that's what you follow we both follow the same okay like up up left and then yeah I'm then another one when is uh down right the same video same video like we both we are doing exactly the same right like so you make the sketch where it's just the dot and then we follow Pathfinder with the right hand uh for for one minutes left right so we move only when it is left right and then another one when it is down right sorry left up and then another video when is down right yeah this is this is so this is so simple as so up right now isn't it rest up right down and how many Loops do we do do five Loops maybe like a video five Loops like so five 5 minutes yeah that's uh it's good amount yeah uh so on the video like make so make the video of five minutes yeah yeah so like the video Loop is five minutes right strange okay I'm working on it yeah I'm recording it right now and just a just a dot yeah it's going to be just a DOT I mean I'm just recording so I can't do the screen sharing right now but um so yeah I'll once recording is done I'll share it with you double check so we can close the chat yeah I mean can yeah yeah I think that's good um I might be a dance studio tomorrow should I record it there with my whole body or should I just do it here doesn't matter maybe do both if you can do both because I will be in the space and I think we have to start thinking H but that's not today like we start we need to start thinking to put it on on space like in a in a big space like one one element that I that I know is interesting but I I I don't have I haven't had the time to explore is when I'm when I record the action in 360 and then I was the video in 360 and then then when I was recording the action of me in the doing the same action uh that was interesting um I don't know exactly why but uh that was some there was something there because it has this aspect of V virtuality uh not not only in the in the in the headset but of course because yeah the fact that I am in the same space repeating the action [Music] um yeah there is there is something there with the with the how some how I think I would like to connect it with with the VR headsets like the the projection of certain action in the VR headset but we don't have to think on this right now because I don't know exactly why it's interesting but it goes on all these things that we are speaking Yeah Yeah I don't know if I understand it exactly but basically the one that you were trying already right that the videos you sending me yeah video that I sent you what I was doing that like when I was in space repeating an action that was projected yeah okay let's come back to the this same link again the call is ending I okay I'm trying but something went wrong of course so I need to fix it somehow the dot disappeared is so weird I just share my screen it just disappeared somehow I have to debug so this is what I got now I shrunk it to 10 seconds just for debugging and after 10 seconds it goes back disappears somehow it didn't go back to the origin I don't know why like I tried to like record it and it was like not working properly oh well but it's fine I mean for now what we need is that it goes back after one minute yeah but it I don't know if it was actually going back because when I I just recorded once but it was not going back to where it was somehow I don't know it's a bit weird and I think I'm getting a bit tired um no but can you can you uh run it for one minute like just do that you do but uh what you did but just put it for one minute right now yeah but yeah I don't know it just then it start to like you know you have to wait for like one minute every time and that's just so there's another video that I just recorded and I don't think it was working um wait oh my [Music] gosh maybe take some like you know what you should happen like so maybe just like we call finish the call and if you can just send that to me today yeah I think so because otherwise I then it stop right now but then just send it to me like in some some sometime yeah so yeah just before finishing this is what I just done so I reloaded so it should start from here this is origin and then after minute it's always Dot and it just disappears here wait but but that where it started yeah three and then in one minutes go go to the minute yeah it's where it started yeah so so I just have to trim it there okay yeah let's just use this uh yeah I think when I reload it it shows this weird bar on the right why is this I don't I don't understand like can you I think it's the website that it's showing it um should we disable it because I think if I do like okay let's just do that so so do screen share I'll just screen share everything think I should have just done that uh so we have it here and wait so what's happening is if I reload it shows this bar I think theb itself so I have to do like in CSS overflow hidden and let's see yeah it doesn't do it anymore so now I open OBS it's like a tutorial so I start recording um this I reloaded okay so we wait for one minute and then well now I know that after 1 minute this dot disappears then I just no that's 10 seconds come on I have to fix that because now it's just 10 seconds yeah for debugging I did it like that but it's good you know now we know that it's working so start recording reload it okay all right so we just wait for one minute so you said one video left and up and another one is right and down right down yeah oh yeah so but this video normally should be five minutes no like should be Loops five Loops yeah I can edit it in ffmp or something or even like quick time somehow okay yeah I think it's possible easy yeah just duplicate the video five times yeah just s together okay that's done stop recording REM and okay I'm gonna maybe just stop here yeah so I'll send it to you later Y and then we we we talk tomorrow cool yeah we back tomorrow uh okay let's keep in touch tomorrow okay", "AAy9lc2BYMA": "okay yeah so I'm getting a bit sleepy now um she this this sweater is not really helping that it's really tight on my neck um the movie so we watched the movie which is quite surprising that we both watch the movie Doctor Strange Doctor Strange yeah it's you know like it's it's entertaining I would put it that way um like to be honest like more than the you know this geometric you know like shifting stuff I found this funny like the the the way they do the spill it's like Pathfinder it's super nice like yeah it's totally Pathfinder and have they great I was actually start checking in in you know like oh you can work with te brush you can um you can put these things in in in totly you can make it totally Pathfinder you know just the square another square square and then the other square a bit like that I mean there there some it's nice because there's all these geometries this are sigil the are the sigil right maybe I should book a flight to is it Nepal and then you know uh train that maybe when we I'm ready to do that I didn't mention also but for the project I thought like for the change of out time time zone I thought like yeah maybe just you have to move go take a travel and go to I don't know leave in the same time zone yeah like Africa not in Europe and that's it yeah like in India like yeah they should be kind of similar to the or I don't know where yeah Africa I think like South South Africa should be like more or less the same Morocco Tunisia go oh yeah nice yeah okay I'll think about it yeah actually I felt the same too I didn't of course you to like I think in Norway nor Norway is not part of the au but shenen I think they're not part of shenen so I mean like the they have a really low security after because they have I think they're very integrated in the European Union you just land there and from there you go illegally to Germany then you stay illegally in Germany then I really become get into a problem but anyways um let's go back to the doctor strange wait than yes or just make a portal then you can go there something that was nice I think was is that I mean I was I was like surprised to see like the many of the things where in the in what we speaking you know the whole movie a part of the the drama but it's like to open this Channel and then you go somewhere else and I found there was one space I think they called the window as space in between like uh where they were manipulating the physics of the space I think they call the mirror window oh so nor like normally you have like the reality and then the the the the open portals to a another space right but in between they is is in that between space is where they were manipulating the physics and like the world was looking different was it like it doesn't affect the real world something like that what they really do that space yeah yeah right yeah this like a lot of things and then they started like shifting time like rewinding time now that you're eating apple oh but this is good that you're saying that the the time yeah because you mentioned this that's a that's a point that we that we should come back on that right you mentioned I think the last week the the fact of that you can go uh ahead time or back in time um you were you were talking last you the feedback because if you have a feedback you normally see something in the past right past yeah you cannot go in front you cannot go in the future you always can see the past not the future yeah but if it's like scripted or choreographed you can see the projection moving ahead of you I mean you just have to fake it make it concrete like example like like what you were doing I mean part of what you were doing is that like normally feedback projection is what's happened already right in the past yeah but you can if this is not a feedback you are watching something that's happening in the future which means you just have to follow what's happening in the projection so the other way around like so it becomes like other way around yeah okay yeah but that that works if you know the logic of feedback if you're just watching if you don't know the idea of feedback then it's just someone who's following the what's happening in the video so all right yeah that's why that's why very stupid with the video like because I was following the video and sometimes look very exact and sometimes you could see like the yeah yeah yeah but it's interesting yeah and there was it like explained in the movie that you know like last part in Kong they were like rewinding time right to like save the the city or the planet but then at one point they were like casting kind of a spell to themselves so that they can move normally in the rewinding time yeah that's something that I didn't completely understood and this no they didn't really say anything about it but they did some kind of trick and then you know like the body got like sliced and then like and then like now they are like not just going back but they have their will to do something in the rewinding time which is kind of it's you know if you think about it it's actually quite weird yeah but the were yeah there's another movie where this guy appears and he's talking of because they basically manipulate the loss of time and space and then when they do that then something will happen like that's that I think that was the reason in the movie why this other guy who he said like I'm out of this because yeah basically when you do something like that it will although it doesn't look like nothing bad is going to happen it will something bad will happen at some point like it's you're not supposed to temper with this time space that's what he's saying right yeah but this was not really like they were not really digging digging this into like deep or because there are like a lot of like other films or series talking about this kind of like time Paradox stuff I mean I'm not you know I'm not so knowledgeable but this this anime series Stein's gate it's like the protagonist wanted to save her friend uh his friend so they were like rewinding time like over and over and over until he gets really like tired of rewinding time I mean which was also happening in do strange you know like he came to you know make a bargain like again and again but I mean that was a little bit comical but you know like this is something that I mean that was also like not really clear why how he was doing it but I think this is interesting like maybe I don't know I would like to see as an exercise like you know in choreography like in the work Martin Martin spam I think one of the choreographers he did I don't remember who else the name but where he was using like uh mature choreographers I think people were more plus 40s or 50s I was something about R what P there I think is this no anyway I think like the what I what what it was interesting at the of the piece that there there's just there's one Loop for the whole piece and it's just it's slightly some changes happen in the loop see so it's almost boring but because it's so much like so I was falling asleep and then at some point you see like things are changing but there then you check and then they actually just the same or or you don't know exactly you start questioning it you just give you this glitch of something happened but you don't know right this too fast and it's based on a loop based on a simp Loop so I mention this here because I would like maybe I don't know to work on that premise on the video [Music] um and something El that I thought is like 10 minutes is too long so let's for like doing something true I think I will what should you do because like because you bed and then I mean I don't know if we should do something but then about this time thing like also we talked about you know this Pathfinder thing is like something like repeating because it's recorded now so whenever you do it and whenever I do it it's going to be the same quote unquote and that's like you know kind of playing with time as well say it again sorry too tired sorry no um like a frozen time what say it again path fine recorded well I'll just write it down uh recorded Pathfinder is frozen time I don't know if it's makes sense to you you know it's like you know packaged time is like packaged yeah yeah there actually like a it's a slice of time because it's I mean a picture a picture is like you're take a snap shot of the time but this is uh this is many pictures uh is a yeah the video the video is a many pictures yeah but yeah capture the sequence of time or whatever yeah sure you think what we do I think it's nice to have exercise but I don't think I have time tomorrow though I I'll try what I will suggest is more I think that I was thinking to take today more like I reflect a bit on what like uh we did last week so I would say let's do today as like re group a bit on on thinking what what is this that we are doing or what could be interesting uh especially if it's about there were some things that I start found in the we you don't have to know all but then just copy paste some of keywords I start like work a lot with chat GPT with um perception yeah time yeah okay I will just keep it as time you know like let's do it just time and then what I will suggest is like let's do this let's do some kind of like theoretical or like B so reflect a bit on what we did and then let's reflect on time and perception of time according time perception and cons Consciousness like is that I think that's a is that difference like Consciousness the perception no consciousness is about yourself Consciousness is more like but per and perception perception is something from outside so more through the senses right like something senses yeah I mean it can be about you but it's about by sensing something but it's not about thinking about you know like not about okay okay okay so yeah I I can of agree with that that Consciousness is so perception will be close to the the sense you will experience how you sense this is for me like what and reception and isn't that too much like like on time and the perception of time and space I like I think what I would like somehow I I found that it's interesting the future aspect of time because that's that's that's close to oh Magic in the sense like you have to do some trickery to speak about the future you have to you know you have to go to that metaphysical space to uh yeah or even tricks to try go in front while there are ways where you can capture how you can show the past right right so there are ways where you can show the past but there are not really ways where you can show the future I mean or you have to is I mean what I found interesting of the future now that we're speaking is that it force you to go to the magical spiritual sigal space it force you to go to something that is not there so you have to make up something and convince me that it is the [Music] future right I mean we can keep it open yeah just we come back with ideas because I have something that I have fure you're getting more groggy time we should go you know what like because like I just like keep it like reflecting time refle time yeah like now I already have something that I can share so I'll do it tomorrow time uh yeah and then I do my thing and then we come back tomorrow yeah okay I let you go and then I need to have some lunch house yeah yeah actually tomorrow I will be visiting um Art University there will be like a seminar or something and he's actually doing a live coding he's live coding Professor so it will be fun so then so but then you won't be online like around two three let's see I mean that's during the day but I have um I'll have dinner with some friends but I'll let you know I mean I think I think like like today would be good you know like 3 pm or something but just let me know yeah let me know like uh we'll see I'll be online from 2:30 3 yeah cool then I think it should yeah okay super okay SL well and if you can you can out I guess like I think I want to see this see I think the second movie there's a second movie yeah you want to watch it yeah then fun don't make spoiler I I don't know if I would watch anyways anyways okay ciao CIA thanks so much and thanks for watching I I don't know I haven't uploaded the one from yesterday but I'll try I'll try to catch up okay for", "t67diPdKjF4": "this first arrange okay separate wait give me a second stop mirroring stop mirring I was thinking like for the next rounds I should just write it not not a chat but a working session or something because we're always like this this is not a chat this is like work work session this is work session we are working ah wait wait mirror no this is the main display stop mirroring extended display building display extended and extended right yes okay just want to do put one of this do they change my projectors know I have like a 12,000 rans okay uh and I'm checking wanted to project [Music] the this is this now of us here I bought my new nail polish in in in in Japan in Japan yes I mean it's not amazing amazing actually like I can't believe like I brought some of like the really good ones so I can still play with these premium ones Hy to see how much yeah this is what I brought from Germany I mean it's imported from the US that's the one part of your project right yes they should sponsor me is from Colombia but this is not is not urgent right now um those here hey so I was thinking that practically speaking that I think the we should uh I think we need to uh start working on a template of a website like then we I think we need to have if I don't know if this possible can we have a a video Loop that is always this universally that doesn't matter when somebody opens a website is always at the same time it's always in the same point that's good point I think that would be great I think that could be something that yeah because that's like where we were heading to and also and also other people I think eventually you know like because I saw you you were doing this with your phone right so I thought like I mean it gives the possibility that so that the video is always there the loop is always there yeah I was wondering like because since like we started like this like because you know you can program it so that always this random generator random number generator can like output same number every time like that's possible so we could like not instead of like I mean we could also record it as a video Loop but also on the web page you know with the canvas like kind of real time rendering like how it's doing now but program it so that it will just Loop the same numbers code is always the same like like with Burling no exactly that you can set some algorithm that random seed Rand exactly the random seat yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah actually but then yeah uh so that good thing but then um I for I'm thinking that in the page but it should have like the full version of of maybe not the full version but I don't know that it should have like uh maybe the full bird it should have like the program I think it should have like some buttons but um that are not necessary right now but I think it's something that we could use also with Modina you know like that because we can start thinking in an interface it has said maybe has like the full interface maybe we can discuss that in another moment what do we need because maybe for maybe it's too much like it's a lot um is that you or that me the music that was weird like I heard something it's [Music] not so I'm projecting you're here H am I there yeah because it's YouTube but can I can I put this YouTube videos in Loop the if you you right click on the video there's like loop loop true yes there is okay uh okay like so this is I guess in the comment that we should start thinking in an interface like this should be an interface so that I think that should be part of the project like it should be a website that is an interface uh with you me and the audience um for now I think that that we need a feature like that uh like for today for instance if is is it a loop I it doesn't matter if it's a video or if it's a program but I would like that if that the video is always running I mean do you see what I mean that there not that the point is always in the same place even when you open it there or when I open here so there is not a starting but there is at some point you mean they're synchronized that they're synchronized like yeah exactly that's yeah I thought about that too that would be really interesting like wherever you are you just open it and everyone watching this see the same thing right when I pH I mean I don't want to get stay too too much into this but I think I will narrow down this and then I will pass it to you something specific I have been reading something uh is this is quite interesting okay and I'll just here I think one of the one of the main things uh is that so Aesthetics they are some that they are experiencing time so through perception and perception is defined through your senses and experiences I mean if we Define the perception is uh perception is something that you perceive through your senses right it's something that it happens and it passes through your senses is different from Consciousness no that is is a very different thing so just an a it's a temporal experience that you you have through your senses and athetics er also ER expand through through your perception basically [Music] um there was there was a point on classically speaking um art uh with art you normally you you need time time and distance because you want in a way blend so basically you want to yeah you want to blend uh in the art uh so you want to have an objective subjective experience of the artwork um in a way I think I'm reframing this in different wordss but I think the idea is that classically speaking with art you need distance from the art to sit and appreciate like so give full attention to the art to let the art speak into you basically and with the with um our interactive media installations uh this um is not longer the true because then the viewer uh I mean the artwork needs the intervention of the viewer to to become something as like experiential yeah I was trying just to point something on yeah this and this is specifically on on web inter in web uh interfaces while made specifically about generative web based installations CID Point could be extended to Encompass interactive new installations how a viewer participant interprets The Narrative of an artwork and interacts with its it is entirely dependent on her experience experien in the world this could also be extended to Encompass the art world as a whole in which no don't pay attention to that I don't know if I think I I don't know if I'm what I think the point I was trying to somehow said here is that the time it's interesting that this Loop if we make so that the website like the artwork is there is always in the same time but regard of if you open or not open the art work is there that was in the the other text you sent me about the you know the museum when there's no one or something like that and that because that's something that you know like Martin was saying in the with the painting painting the yeah yeah butet do also but I think he was had the same reference about you know like music like the best time in the museum is like when there's no one something like that best time for the paintings I don't know iot what's exactly okay um but going back to this so I think let's this is in the how would you go that like can you make that the museum no like the the loop um the loop but this is really interesting like the you [Music] know so I mean we have to define a few things right so we are talking about like several things like one is the loop that always does the same thing and the other thing is this synchronized thing that whenever you see it wherever you see it everyone's watching the page they're seeing same same thing but they are two different I mean it's not to separate thing the second one how would you say I mean I was thinking about this so basically just check the like the time and the program is doing the same instruction like based on the time so you know like if if it's 10: a. it's this movement I mean repeat for one minute you know basic the time Computing time yeah yeah yeah and then just use the universal time so that you know well it doesn't have to be even universal time because it's just repeating same thing every every minute no but that makes sense and then it's up to to you if you want to make it like with the program itself you know then then it's just the the program with a a seat like making a loop like a random seat using seats or if we work also with the video because the result will be I mean the same for now yeah yeah maybe yeah yeah let's see which is easier I mean video is not easy solution um no because I mean because the problem is that we will have I guess at the end more that we advance but we we will have to have more flexibility no so the right we will we will work with more with code so we can bypass it now by by videos but we need to start understanding how to control this in time totally yeah yeah um but think about it so that's something that we should start thinking like this should uh yeah it should be like this so that's uh my homework yeah make something and [Music] then and then the other thing is that I would like to start like bringing back then no cool so I would like to like that we talk again about like the sigils like how are we what are the sigil like that we make we start thinking on that and physically do something with it um but before that let's talk about the experience let's go back to the Contemporary Workshop yes I actually took a uh contact infro Workshop yesterday oh yeah that was really nice like yeah I don't know how to say um maybe maybe I can start like from saying that the way I mean because just from the physical experience um is connected through the Clon you make you send me a message in in WhatsApp that you were mentioning the Clon time right the way who I because we cannot keep on moving if if the command or the the score is to move La up there's a point where you cannot go up right so basically yeah just to recap we had the the dot moving around and then first we did just following the dot the first one so it always comes back but then we did we only follow when it goes left and up and we just ignore everything right everything else I mean right and down and then we did the opposite we just follow right and the going down and so we were saying you're saying yeah like we can't keep if the point so if the point is so we are saying that we do left up at some point the uh given moment the point want to go right that maybe and the next Point might be left so the way who I was dealing with that it was if I'm doing if if what is happening is up left this is what the point is doing like up left right meaning that I only will move up left you can see it maybe yeah skip a little bit or yeah just just you can fast forward in a bit more like in the middle you can put it I was really stretching okay left okay so let's check what I'm doing so it should move up left stop okay stop stop stop stop stop so like go back like two seconds I think yeah I think what I'm trying to say like I'm resetting my movement and I was if you go to the 254 really hard to find to so I play with the mouse with the two fingers you can oh you can go faster go down up I figure out here right or is it you see like this which which one are you looking at the you on the left or the right left the one to the left okay so like again yeah like this here yeah so my hand you see I go down up so go maybe few seconds after before again yeah this here this okay stop so when when there is no motion so when there is motion right down I'm not moving but the next movement that is up or left I will go I reset my motion to the last Point uh yeah you understand that uh maybe I'm not explain really good but I think you understand what I'm trying to say can you ex can can can can you said what I'm saying so oh my gosh um I had a long day so you're trying to yeah like kind of swing like yeah you were resetting yeah I'm instead of like stretching to like really like reach out there so that you can start from the origin somehow yeah because also otherwise I could not move anymore yeah but that's interesting because the way you did it is like you are already like at the limit and then from The Next Movement you need to follow you reset it right but the way I did was so so you are already at the limit and then you're waiting until the next up that you can't do anymore yeah yeah so so you decided that when there's up you reset and go up again I reset to the place I mean to the grid because yeah yeah to the grid because you're already drifting a lot from the yeah so if I keep if I stop if I stop in the limit of left up uh because there is right down movements the next time there is a left up I will be out of the grid right uh right so if I'm at the limit of left up uh um and the next movement that it will be up left I will just reset in the G that point to where is in right left right down to yeah Bally to stay in the greed the way I did it was more like I try to like stretch and then instead instead of like waiting for the next thing that I have to follow because this is repeating so I know that okay there is a time that there like right and down and right and down so I just like go back while I'm kind of like resting when you cannot move anymore so I can't move anymore yeah but then here like I know already that next it's coming up that is like right and down and right and down that I don't have to follow for the next movements so there's like a gap so that's the time I decide to okay I go back to the center so you but you're reentering you are resetting to the center yeah when I don't have to move yeah but you are resetting when you have to move kind of yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I reset I have to move yeah yeah because and and also it gives this quality the quality of movement changes no because you have to catch up you have to so you have to go reset fast before you do the other movement yeah I mean this is something that we didn't Define so it's interesting like how we interpret differently which is I mean this is which this is what I think is interesting when within the research that I propos Ser about the perception and how we interpret the same thing uh that's why like the the projection image like this is something that I found very interesting like the the the one to the right up because I my movements somehow are similar but they are different like and and you did like some kind of like different articulation in the second one at sometimes I was like literally putting my hand left you know like I think I was putting my oh oh but this I remember like I remember like that sorry like that this was something that I thought was interesting like in this exercise of projecting yourself um is that in terms of future you can play it with this with the future thing because I almost sometimes could go fast I mean yeah I could go in in the future following you you see sometimes I will go faster then then the projection interesting oh yeah and now I seeing that you're resetting yourself like in I was watching like the in in the video down right you are also walk you are resetting completely yourself to the middle yeah yeah did you make a recording with you doing fast this like at two speed twice speed no this is just a normal speed can you like maybe show like the one that I think I did twice the speed think it's called Fast let's see uh fast or fast projected should we check no fast that's just fast so stop share and then do [Music] sharing no uh so it's like double speed right this is double speed the the dot is a double speed and I'm moving left up yeah yeah yeah okay now it makes sense like why you're doing this movement because that's the resetting at first I thought it's more like the like different articulation you wanted with the movement and I didn't know it comes from the idea of like reset and then move yeah yeah yeah exactly yeah res something move yeah so also the quality of move M will come like that because you need to go fast yeah yeah I was just thinking like if we decide to make the the dot moving only left and up that's possible if we wrap around right so if the dot hits the limit then it just like wrap around like it comes from the bottom and it goes all the way to the left then it just like wrap around and comes from the right yeah so that's the kind of thing that I me mentioned because uh I mean with the nonan space I don't I can exp can you expand on that because if you're just moving to the left then in the ukian spaces you just keep moving to the left but we can define a space that wraps around that's nonukan space I think so like at one point the point disappears and shows up on the other side but it's not going in circle but I think that's I think it's interesting that that maybe let's we have to come back to this yeah this okay same link I think it's interesting because we can uh it will provide also more more motion it will I mean if if we do at some point you have to if you're going left up and then the point of the left will appear to the right you will have to go there anyway to or you have to do something with that uh so it will provide more motion by wrapping around like just going yeah yeah yeah I mean I just found like it's like really nice idea to like Bridge from what we talked about like this hyperbolic or like non uclean in space and VR and then like what is like to embody that so this task actually is to embody this non nucle in Space by just following left and up and then some at one point of course you have to reset or you have to decide something that is not in the instruction but this is then interesting in I see them the possibility to acknowledge that it changes like I mean I like that the way how you're connecting that with with the the virtuality uh like not being or changing from the real space so real space be in the grid to an out of the grid so to no C the space um but then maybe it gives the chance to then do something in that moment or or to acknowledge that they a glitch but yeah like I see or to to go back then to this metaphysical space like then to a uh it gives so something is out of the space uh so what I was speaking was from a physical perspective that will be interesting from motion that it it forces you to move but uh if what I what I'm interested in right now is like trying to bring this back to the the conversation of the sigils or the metaphysical I think through this Nu no Lan perspective on this grid it could work like the I mean in concept works you know like I understand why you're saying that it works in my head it works like it makes sense like it enters a the that metaphysical space in that moment it is going somewhere that allow the dot to appear to the right part watching the video um Can can you play the video of the that is called Fast What fast and projected I think fast projected yeah it's like you're competing each other almost it has this quality that it feels almost like the the two characters that you see that they are different person no like the while in the previous one then you don't I mean it they seem this one they see quite different though you think so like I found like the movement quality wise the last one is more different but this one it feels like more like a competitive like you're like competing with each other like you have to be the first one yeah and that was like everyone was you know like catching up I was really trying to like is but I think is interesting is in the previous one I have I'm playing full uh with almost this possibility to be in future and in the past um I can allow myself to play with this and then try to be sometime fast or sometimes slow uh I'm almost playing with this feedback while here I'm just trying to be faster yeah yeah but this is I think it could be interesting like what else like what what like maybe they should be other other things that I could do you know like uh what I found interesting and this is like and that's part of my notes is like this element of Loops multiplicity uh is interesting uh so perhaps there are ways [Music] to to find basically different scores like in this one my score was being fast right in the previous one I was trying to be playful right um maybe I could do the opposite like maybe I could try if it moves to the left I would move to the right I don't know like to find yeah to find like to find ways like to give purpose to to to this other character I I really like I really like this recording uh of myself doing the exercise because already I know it's like then it's that I have one instance of myself doing one task and then start trying to do things with the with that with that base yeah this is like definitely something more than how we started like At first I was thinking you know like different shapes and I mean this inner feeling that was also interesting but then it's something like kind of added quality to the movement right like we can move softer or more grounded but that's kind of like articulation like that's kind of more like you know what you add to this movement but now we're talking about you know like do it faster or doing like you know playfulness that's something more of a instruction concrete instruction that you have and then the body react to it it's not like the body is trying to manifest something but you have the instruction the choreography in actually two levels one is the Pathfinder itself and the second one is another like added instruction and then we see how like what body does I'm trying to think about like where we started or you started about this VR being representational geometric and it's hard to embody and we are already like embodying it and it's not VR but with this geometry we're embodying this geometry right somehow through this exercise embodying the geometry like we're trying to embody the geometry I think there is this element of like difference between the viewer and the performer like I'm seeing that I'm founding interesting things when we watch these things again um yeah because if you think like from the Mover like perspective then just the commands gets clear so physically you are just engaged in doing something but it's not really you're not thinking from a metaphysical perspective it's just a physical action that it gets concrete for you as performer to do something but then when you as viewer you are perceiving that you make you start giving meaning of that so then we start talking then in your words then you put words on that and I put words on that I I start giving meaning because what we see is something that is un volving uh in Loops I mean there is is not random and it's also is not completely perfect but there is a there is a there is a a cue in what is in what we see as as as viewer but we are experiencing as a mover like I really thought about this uh twister I never played it but you know like it's it's like a mat with you know different colors and you have to like you know touch the color that shows up right it's basically like that like you know at one point becomes impossible but you still have to follow but this is interesting what the why the Twister it's not possible because there's more people because if you if you're alone then you can keep on doing it forever well I I don't know exactly the rules but I guess you can't like at one point no or like depending on like your pose if I think depends more more or less about because I think the main you just go they tell you your hand or hand hand left right and right left foot and then it's fine as if you are alone I guess but once you are with more people then you cannot do that I mean at some point you just get in Tangled and then just you fall yeah yeah and then I actually when Mi was presenting like like at his talk I think he made Pathfinder because he wanted to make some kind of inspiration that basically like impossible to do so he started with like a little Avatar of the body that moves like completely random and that's like the way he wanted to have like in inspiration for you know he was doing popping and you know like imagination is limited so he wanted to like make the algorithm just do random stuff random movements with the avatar and try to do that with your body and then he moved to Pathfinder which is more geometric not like a human body but I think the idea came from that kind of impossible movements I was thinking that what then maybe we could try to think from the perspective of the viewer like what if what is that we like we would like to see as viewers like saying that like what we are doing so far I think is trying to make it clear for us as movers performers sure um so what do we try to switch and try to think what is that we find interesting on this so how what what we would like to see more of of is right just just throwing something really General but people tend I mean most of people like to see bodies not lines what do you mean like this geometric stuff like some people are super interested in this kind of representation but PE often people don't get engaged in just you know watching dots and lines this super General thing statement I'm making like that you mean like people will be more interested in seeing people than ex yeah even if it's like projected visuals because I had this performance like many years ago I started with like generative stuff that I took it took like hours and hours and to make and everyone was like just like like yeah and it was really weird because the audience like most of them were like families from the neighborhood that was in Korea and then s like at one point I started showing my face Pro did and they start deform my face with face tracking but be even before doing face tracking I just projected my face and everyone's laughing and I mean it makes sense now now that I think of it makes sense but then what happen like so if is say this is projected and after two minutes then the person comes in space and then it does something with it the viewer needs to start finding out what is his person you will need to start to figure it out what is the purpose of and then after a point like if it's just straightforward it will get out it's just following the dot right um and then you can start decomposing I mean like doing something with it as we we were just doing in the past days like like basically increase the complexity somehow the algorithm that you are trying [Music] to [Music] um and that's one way to go I guess um I this is something from the things that I'm reading that there is not about showing I mean that in this kind of work or the way I would like to approach this is uh yeah actually that the difference put between performing art or interactive media installations of media artworks is not about this that that in performance you often you show something to people um while in interactive Arts then the people are doing the artwork with you uh and something also like that the artist is not changing ing the artwork while is is presented to the PE people like that would be in perform in performing art you are changing what you're presenting you're presenting something and you people give you attention and then you start yeah you're presenting something you're sharing something with the people um but there is this distance no um um yeah and it's like one to many most of the time yeah interactive stuff it's like one to one or like I mean it can be different but but I was thinking like do you want to use spoken words or like text absolutely no like I think they should be uh the most I would like to make it very clear so that is not so starting like from saying like this is not the performance like you know this is like the sharing of something but like to basically to clarify the expectations you know like what is what is this not about or what is this about what is this not no I just words but but are you thinking of something like a lecture performance or is performance yeah like I think I would like something as lecture performance H I found like I don't know this is just my personal preference but like this lecture performance thingy like really tricky that it's not a lecture and it's not a performance like I end up to me like it ends up something like it's nothing yeah no I get it so I guess the way I would like to see it is just like to be to use wordss when it needs to be used you know like say for instance like if I decided to do in this way uh just an example as I said like just the Greet then the person then involves in something um then just saying that that's gonna happen basically um just literally underlying things that they are obvious uh which is normally not the way how I will I work uh and in art in art you constantly you you yeah you make things interesting so I think my approach to this will not be make it interesting somehow but more obvious I would like like I guess my my the goal would more if h a grandma or somebody who comes here with no knowledge on this can get out hey that's what doing like my intention will be more in in clarifying some points that I think are interesting to share I I think that's really on point like regarding the audience that will come to this event I think it makes sense what did I say well you just said underlying things that are obvious obvious yeah things are yeah yeah things are obvious it's good I think yeah like now interesting working on the perception of dance one is mediated through digital environments and that eventually will I mean digital environments like virtual reality headsets that's uh I mean that's where I want to aim this um but not right now I'm not right but this is like next question right like what is this four because this is not is this a VR piece that you want to make or is it like a stage performance you want to make or is it something else people will question I mean regarding the audience who would come to this they need to picture like what is this made for what kind of presentation I mean yeah what format is this what do you mean [Music] the so like super practical but for example you know someone from the theater another theater comes and then see they see the piece then but then they need to know are you like trying to make a 30 minute performance from this on the stage or is it something like VR installation you want to make or is it something else for example I mean we could say it's a research but then in a way I think is I think the performance will come anyway uh because yeah that's from where for where I come from and also it will also happen with and what we work with Modina also is a performance right so so I think I see it more like as a performance installation like it's something that it has a moment where uh expands I mean with performance moment but it's also something that can stay as an installation I mean that's what I would like that's what I would like to see to go and the reason why I like this word like performance like Elric performance is because then what I'm doing I see it as a this is a research yes it's weird because like I actually I wanted to have this as more like to actually work on the content like I'm researching again like this is a research um so the content is not here yet like and my my proposal here was to work on to and where I like the content is what I speak about like the sigils or trying to find something that is yeah yeah content basically that um yeah you have to create the world basically about like yeah what where this resides yeah and this is not there yet so and I don't know I want to F I want to to use the sigils as excuse for things there I mean that's my I still I think I want to insist in that idea and try to let it become something um it's through that that I think like the content should appear yeah so coming back to what I asked like what is this for I feel like I don't know like what probably like we're on the same page like you know this kind of this is something you know plastic or something that can take different forms right it it is a performance but it's more like this itself is the media like best practices for example like this itself is the media and we're not making the performance but it can be a performance and it can be a workshop and it can be a web installation somehow and I think what like this this project is also like like maybe the sigil is something that is in the center but it kind of goes to the performance and also it can be a performative installation or it probably can be like a VR experience as well or web installation that it's like mixed media like mixed media [Music] um it's I don't know like you know like one content can be a movie and also TV series and you know they can have merge different angles I'm I'm trying to think something like that more like a popular culture where you can have different Outlets or it's like a Comics that you know becomes a movie and series toys but I don't know if that's like clear to those people or the audience or is it just making it more complicated yeah I think that it makes it more complicated yeah yeah because would like it like like to bring it somehow to or at least to to approach it with forcing it or to become a performance or to become an installation or something that is more clear because I know by the nature how I work will not do that completely while if I just allow just to keep it open it can be become complex in in nature to um yeah like the yeah like practices like it becomes more something that is uh yeah it's something in itself so yeah um as you said something in itself yeah so I IDE like I think I would like in also was thinking like um I don't know like to use Maybe so like the people perceive dance in different ways mediated technology but then is that do they have to then see a dance you know meaning that then meaning that if you then is do do I have to show them a dance uh or are they the dance you know like it is if um if they are seeing a dance and then through technology they perceive the dance differently is different than if they are doing the dance whatever that dance is and then you get the point that I'm saying like basically who are they they is audience the AUD view yeah like if I present some dance and then through technology then show different perspectives or if they are the dance like interaction Interactive yeah like they become the piece like if they are the D they aware that they are so there's a question like yes I think I I feel like they have to see something instead of trying out because from the earlier discussion it's like we found more when we watch us mov moving right I mean that's more the interesting part in this project I feel I mean of course as a m there is there are things that we discover but from the distance we see something that is was not intended in a way which is interesting yeah so they should be at dance they should be at dance like that we should create a dance for them to see it's not an so it's not only an so in that sense it's not only an inst ation they should be a dance in this way how we I mean now we are approaching the dance through the PA Pathfinder in this case is the dance um could be different things but in these cases like right now we are approaching through Pathfinder right and I'm totally fine with that then uh um yeah I still question is that but more the question is like is that the only option I don't know I'm just I mean one can assume like the dance will be like say like the loop like the Pathfinder just itself without a body you know you can present as that um but I think an easy way to take it at least I think until the next week like but is will be through a buddy so through me or you like through like performers who are doing Pathfinder somehow like uh and then see from there if the audience is invited to do something or if is the if is required for the audience to do something [Music] um something we didn't talk about is when we do it you're filming your back with a projection yeah when I do it I fil myself like this so that you don't see Pathfinder video right yeah that's something we could play with also you know because I was like keep think I kept thinking like what if at first or you know at one point the audience doesn't see the dot that's just the body but this is something I mean this is something actually literally that I can do what if for instance if I record and I can do it in a loop like you know like then using the same [Music] Loop um the loop the loop happens then I go into the space then I do with the loop uh and then I project then I use my headset and then I basically do that but then there's no projection I'm not projecting anything uh or I can put it the other way around what if I if I go into the space I project the loop in the VR headset so then I'm I'm I'm doing it but nobody see what I'm doing people are just seeing that I'm moving uh yeah but you could also do the same as I do just have a laptop or you know it can be a projection but just film yourself from the front without without projecting that I mean you could project it but if the camera is at the projection I mean just just have to move the camera that is filming your back just move it to the stage or the well know the me yeah just film you then the camera will see you but not projection right yes I'm just thinking like for example like if the audience just see that maybe as a video at first then you they don't know what you're doing right that you are actually following the dot but they don't see that they are following dot I'm just like throwing this there is like you know some like missing part if someone for the first time to watch that video that you are just doing this yeah let's come back to the call again wait I go to the to give me one minutes two minutes and I yeah same uh so I'll just close it and then we come back to same okay something I found interesting so in the video like I shot in the studio in dance studio so there were some people watching like I asked them you know like can I just take five minutes to just film myself and I didn't explain anything to them and I was holding one phone and using another phone to film myself and after I finished like they asked me like what was on my phone and then they thought like I was actually like watching myself through another camera and doing some kind of complex feedback or whatever but it was just the thought that was moving which I found it's funny you know if you don't see Pathfinder video people try to think what this is and they come up with like crazy ideas and then in fact it's just dot that's moving in the grid and that's why like I thought what if we project or perform something without showing Pathfinder at first what I think it was interesting I think I totally followed your idea but somehow I like that what if is but you're doing basically the same if I'm if I'm having the BR headset h i mean that could be one scenario right it looks like you're doing something really complex if you have VR headset and trying to no you are moving you have a VR headset you're what just watching Pathfinder and following the dot but visually if you have the headset and if you're moving then people have to think what you are doing and then it looks really complex thing that you're doing I don't know if that's something you are yeah yeah because I mean what I like is it just I think that's something we can start thinking that I was thinking of that like we have to expand of that no another moment that but perhaps one way how we can may work with through the technology is maybe um do it uh create an augmented reality application that you can just put it in a foam or and um don't know for now but perhaps that's something that I thought that maybe we can think about it oh what is so what is the purpose of like the so to think more like in in the nature of the of the medium so medium being the the VR headset and they not wanted to deal with the whole I mean not wanted to give like 10 beer headsets for like I don't know like so working with the nature of the of the of the medium so yeah in that case it's like through the through the VR headset that you can see Pathfinder and you are doing it but the people don't know what are you seeing so you're hitting that and after you just showing them that I we just record it and then we can talk on that like I just do Pathfinder so the loop one of the videos that we have right maybe we just stick to the five minute five Loops thingy yeah the last one yeah what I'm thinking that yeah maybe just we can talk on that like what is the because what we're trying to achieve here is like more like see what is what what is the perspective from the audience so that maybe just could be just that now like then I do the exercise and then with the head with the headset I record myself into space doing that and then I project then then also then I record myself I mean I try to do it in one action there's just one one one recording then I just then I just take off my headset and do the same but without the headset and you think you can ask around just show the video of you moving with a headset and you know doesn't they don't have to watch the whole five minutes but just you know ask people other artist what they think about what you're doing of the video that I should like then I showed them the video yeah that's I think that's easier I mean they can come to your filming for then becomes a performance yeah no just a video but then I'm thinking that the I don't know I'm just already seeing like the problems you know it might be it might take longer than then but I just I will do it I guess and based on that then yeah I mean just film it and then see like I was trying to think like what I can do I don't have V headset I don't have big space but for example like what if I just do the exercise like maybe like draw on the notebook film it so like I I'm going to watch Pathfinder and just follow with my pen I don't know if that makes sense but like filming the drawing part or I could you know I mean I already I already did in front of the camera but what else can I do that doesn't show the video itself but I could do something it can be also you know like connected to Ritual right like what kind of ritual I can do from the movement of Pathfinder yeah and I like more that like than I I think I like the the but you said like just drawing then you will draw differently like and how I will draw yeah can we do that then like just for a second like can you take a paper and then we just take and then we then we can show each other I would like to see what is that you see we just follow everything right not just left and up and it's just well whatever whatever you do do I have a pen yes I have a pen okay I mean I wanted to record it but let's see I can I can use my phone actually to this thing has this this phone with this phone you actually you can do that but it comes I don't know with your phone you can but with your computer I know you can do it you have I mean I just have to hold it like this for five minutes or I could maybe put it [Music] somewhere yeah I'll try [Music] this look what I got my family are musicians I mean my brother and my mom no I know I can do this by this state manager I know this okay do this I'm G just start wait I need to H why like this my God Bo like I [Music] I'm okay yeah you can share can you share wait I it still three minutes and can we do it again what I'll just finish for another two minutes and then I'll show it to you h okay and I got video recording I don't know if I can just like do airdrop to my computer will take some time maybe but can you I'll do it proper way I'll try to do it proper way it will be fast uh it rotate right sound off play and just we this video five minutes is one minutes five times yes so if you finish it's like 1 minute and 3 seconds or something I was not looking at the notebook at all it's really funny to see it really creepy it looks like I have some kind of intention I think what is interesting is that it's quite simple is that we don't know why are you are doing something that is concrete but we don't know why exactly like you try to guess what I'm doing right yeah exactly you constantly I I'm constantly trying to like what are you doing yeah that's what it makes it interesting yeah I like that my left hand is not moving at all that nice performance yeah yeah I mean it's quite clear I like that that is quite clear shall we like so you do VR I mean you should also do this I think or we just provise what we can do so what are we doing yeah we can improvise but but what are we doing we're trying to I thought like film something that doesn't show Pathfinder Pathfinder okay but we keep the same material like the same like five minutes Loop I mean we could have like Concrete in the concrete tasks but um because I think I'm I'm bit lost in I think there is something that is kind of getting clear for me somehow in I don't know how to articulate this with words that maybe the FOC I mean what we we trying to do right now is [Music] to yeah I don't know yeah okay maybe just like let's do like this for today and then but because I would like to to go back to to this idea of like the seil like what is right um but maybe it doesn't have bad but yeah doesn't have to be forc right now but I I I started to think like the video of loop of Pathfinder itself is like seual that I mean in that article you sent me like Sig is something that you create right from so you have like a wish or something and then you construct with different shapes and for example this is like complete nonsense in a way if you just look at this but we started to like I mean we already worked on this video Loop like couple times so we started like generate like meaning although it was generated completely random and I think that's I I see that's kind of the entry point where we're creating Sigel but not in a way that normally you would do so you will see like that the sigil itself like the sigil is the Pathfinder itself and then we choose and then we choose how to reveal or not reveal that right instead of we design it it is designing us I don't know if that Mak sense but and I like the process because it's kind of like flipped and something that would be overlooked we're looking investigating something that is overlooked normally what which is just the dot like people wouldn't really value or Find meaning in just you know dot moving like almost like random fashion but we're trying to Find meaning I mean it is already in a way Enchanted it's Enchanted dot right and we're already initiating the ritual to enter the the dot which it might be part of the the geometric or the VR space where you started or there the symbol symbolic representation but we're flipping it's not like we're capturing the body and quantizing the body into dots but instead we started from the dot and we're embodying it we're making ritual around it I mean it doesn't have to finish with this idea but I feel like this is like interesting perspective to your project or our project because you know we like really literally flipping the perspective so we that we are so yeah so because normally so in flat what you see is is a DOT that is moving right so then you're saying that we are not what the words that you use that we are not quantifying that or we are not mimicing that right I mean quantify I said because you know if you use motion capture that's a process that you quantify or quantize the body into dots right points that moves in this 3D space so it kind of like degenerating your body but instead we're like expanding from the dot to in like as if we're trying to make the dot into the body or embodied experience or to change like yeah to change the to manifest the dot in different in different the different different ways so taking the dot out from the screen and how yeah I mean that's literally what we doing body or in any other different action yeah I really like this actually I think it's really cute also so if the if the if Pathfinder is the sigil and then we are saying that the sigil connects what is what is in physical through metaphysical um in the in the in the exercise of the of the drawing the physical is the physical of you doing that and actually becomes metaphysical uh when the viewer see it right I mean for it's going back to like for for you you are doing an action you know like we can let's but then from the the audience is the one who has to find meaning in your au action because it is concrete but the yeah the the audience doesn't have uh the information of why you're doing that right they have to extrapolate and they have to imagine what yeah and in fact it was just a DOT it's just a DOT moving that you're seeing but we're not seeing but this makes sense that you know that we can say that actually dot has a meaning because you thought about the meaning as an audience try to you know fantasize so many things from the dot this is like but what we you you said like so I'm trying kind of to say this so the theil is in the middle so theil connects like physical and metaphysical or like dance uh with dance with meaning yeah that has physical dance with movement s then one I this also is objective movement yeah yeah okay because I'm thinking like so this is like from the perspective of the audience so the audience what you're seeing is like there's objective movement so like this is objective for everybody just seeing this right um right it's concrete it's concrete [Music] um it only makes sense I mean they have they have to start finding something through the through the sigil which they don't see they don't see the Sig they don't see the sigil how much maybe that's a question how much how much or or how do they see of the Sig then in this case is Pathfinder that that could be something that can like help us afterwards to think in ways to show part ly or to do something with it that but in this case uh the physical concrete movement of the hand they they don't see but they connect the the dancer wait they connect the dancer with the view do they connect the dancer with the viewer wa answer you mean like when dancer is following the dot yeah I mean it's the same process right they would the viewer will think try to imagine what they are doing when do they say the dancer that following dot try to think what the intention of the dancer is right because they don't see the video um so CER audience uh tries to you understand I'm motion and I think there's different implication so one if the camera is like watching me and I'm doing like you know like as just like what I did with the setup that I see the video on the screen and I recorded with the webcam versus us do it with a VR headset because if you're doing with the VR headset then I mean if if I'm doing like this then it might be like a choreography that I remember and try to do something but if you're wearing a headset then people would probably think that there is something happening in the headset that is something I think there's something here like that that we are not mentioning but it appears in in that is U what it makes it interesting from this exercise is that we have traces like you have like the paper keeps I mean the paper still is there like and it will be there um I mean it stays there especially because it's physical no the paper will be there [Music] um so that's something this the traces is like um let's come back tomorrow yeah um yeah and I don't know I mean probably you want to try the VR or something to just record yeah let's let's try to let's try to keep it open if you see also something yeah yeah I'll try to think what I can do if there's anything else I mean I also have the homework to try try out know how to make it repeatable Pathfinder web page yeah yeah yeah yeah this like you can check on this I think on that yeah yeah yeah yeah okay now if I come up with that other exercise I'll I'll do it um but let's see yeah but I think we we're touching like really interesting ideas that not just interesting for us but you know it's probably like interesting to show and that's yeah good yeah and you just need to find a way like to articulate that right but it is yeah I think it's interesting yeah yeah it's it's we we have a good concept so and I think the", "pNOkA-iO6xo": "right so how was it for for you to do the the excise yeah maybe you you can just share it while we right so so this is like the the circle you know when we sit in a circle and no we talk about what happened the contemporary dance worship exactly yeah who was it for you yeah who was it for you okay I have to come back to that moment right it's been a few hours but it's like wait sorry can can you can you can you share your screen while you saying this yes wait a second um by the way I started to find the way to do this with command line like to make the video composition so it um so really is like Linux command like from the Mac yeah because Mac has the I mean Mac is like Linux right I mean yeah I mean Unix and you can have like FFM FFM command line and you can write it's more almost like a program to like set how you want to make the composition with four videos and then what's start time I figured out how to set the start time so they're not perfectly synced but more or less like you know know synchronized like I I adjust it manually but instead of like cropping IM like videos in quick time and then put them together but this one like I said like okay this image one second delay this one two seconds delay because everyone has different delays I just writed that in the command line and like put them together anyways so I'm starting to find the pipeline of you know I me or workflow to put them together this is interesting I would like to get to know that but mean now yeah so um so on the left side it's the more like inside right how you feel about this I mean you have to feel the shape uh is it like a how was it uniform no protection is a circle um but instead of like expressing we're feeling it and on the right side they're the ones that more like expressive yeah so like but so the exercise before this the the symbols was to do with the body to follow the the point and a line right just that the point the line and then after dot we introduce a circle a square and a triangle yeah the separate from the line yeah yeah and then that the circle was about protection right triangle was about manifestation balance balance manifestation this and then the square was about grounding grounding yeah stab I don't know what rounding it's funny El to see okay like yeah but please go on yeah so so because we did like twice like first round I was like just you know I kept thinking like what would it be in the second round so I was like already kind of like thinking about it although I was not doing you know like gestural stuff in the first round and then I kind of like like I was like mentally rehearsing like how it would be like what would be the movement while you were doing the first one first one yeah yeah I have time to like yeah to prepare and then but then like you know it's because when you were talking about this idea like it felt like almost like you know you apply like different styles to the movement so you know like Circle would be like I don't know like can be like type of dance movements or um style like you said ballet for I don't know like was a triangle triangle yeah yeah I was like kind of I mean okay so first of all I don't have like formal dance education so I can't do that um although I can just you know pretend something but but then like you know I I felt like that's not really the what we're looking for because that's just the style right just something like added on top of it but I felt like it has to come from the inside so so I tried to take it more like simple like triangle was the easiest one to me because I thought about balance so when I was moving like I try to like really think about the balance of the body so if you look at me like you know in the video like when the hand is going this way and I counterbalance myself just to you know think about the the mechanics you know about the the body itself but like really like exaggerating that um and the square I really like did the opposite so that I was like really like still like and then just like feeling the um the arm really light so that it's like not affecting the the trunk or the Stem Circle I don't know Circle I was trying to like do something that is more like round and yeah but I it was not really like doesn't really clicked me can you fast forward to the circle to back go back to the circle to to the to the square square yeah okay so this was when it started almost yeah I like how my gaze changes but it's a little bit subtle I think what I it is super subtle like but but that's what what I think is what I like from the composition is while I was doing the excise I noticed like my changes should be very [Music] small so then you have a yeah you have um half of your body's the composition of yours is you are in the screen half of your body's screen right so then you can see the subtle changes in your intention but also like the hands for instance your different yeah by the way I was not looking at the camera image of myself when I was moving so that's why like sometimes it goes off the screen because I was not really looking at myself I was just looking at the video Pathfinder because otherwise I start you know like it's like a mirror in the dance studio and contemporary dance studios they don't have mirrors but something that I thought that is that is needed in the wait did you did it one after the other I mean did you do this exercise for 20 minutes non-stop almost yeah yeah how was that for you um this is really like contemporary workship I know I know no it was it was good like you know the only thing that was tiring is my eyes I have to say because I I noticed like after like 10 minutes like my eyes started like like not dry but I think it was dry actually because I noticed that I was really like Focus focusing on the screen and then okay like I have to Blink like otherwise I mean this is not good but right in terms of like going to the flow I think it was fine like going like for like 20 minutes I could I could do it easily yeah for me was like because I was using my whole body it was intense yeah yeah I can see it yeah it was quite intense yeah give me a [Music] second and that's it oh do you want to see it again yeah you can you can you can keep it you can put it so I thought it was um uh I think that that we should um spend some time more in the so I think in within the storytelling or in dramy or in the narrative um me with that I mean the the intention what are the basically the selection of the words what the triangle means what a square means and what a um because that that I mean that's that's the sigil basically so that's that's what ideally should create meaning or open like a special meaning for you and for me so I think we should find like we should spend time in there it should be special so yeah it should it must be something different um like for instance what like what you remember what I my memory on the on the commands were protection protection um manifestation so protection yeah protection triangle manifestation and grounding square right so and yours where what what is the stat in your head like like if you think fast what what were the three of you I just saw it again but like uh I think Circle was like Unity okay like I or maybe I thought uniform but I think it's just unity and balance the triangle and grounding yeah that's interesting so because I mean these words are given from us for us so what I found is interesting is that we have a different interpretation or like we jump into something that is for whatever reason like I I guess I I just it stays in my head but was the F the some personal reason stays in my head that word uh so I think we could find maybe we can just do it now like let's like to to write possible um meanings for this circle triangle and square okay like just to ex expand extend exp this like yeah see find another place circle triangle square but like from the movement or like the experience or whatever whatever that's a trick yeah that's a tricky no that's tricky yeah like we have it's interesting because we have already experience with it okay I will just let's do let oh what I did uh no know what I'm doing oh you want to write it together I thought like we writing separate yeah let's just do it now and then for form it later round circle [Music] circle is equilibrium correct Tre talk about it yep I think I put it in the wrong place so I will just take everything up here yeah we just put it there on yeah because yeah I thought we'd write separately so I just like B underneath but it's that's fine so just put okay so now what do we have in circle so we have Circle curve softness round complete stable uniform flow eternity infinite the last on yeah yeah yeah like a circle is I think is uh it's a it's continuous no is a is a continuous thing yeah yeah uh maybe just let's read all of them first triangle equilibrium precarious potential precarious yeah I kind of like this I just potential perspective yeah difference is different yeah visible angle Edge yeah yeah um square square solid rigid slow grounding always there continuous line modular pixel block kind of Bor kind of boring why I don't know but that's my feeling noise B it's just Square I know what you mean yeah it's just like when you do like a circle it's just a circle geometrically I mean you make just it's a square with many more sides like polyg in a polygon so it's so it's a so a square is just a boring a Bard a boring Circle it's a boring Circle but so you know way it seems coming like kind of like the triangle is kind of a start like between these three things like triangle is a shiny thing there a shining thing um the square I don't know if it's Al because appears at the end could be that the bias that we have that maybe but it's kind of like ah it's just like the Earth it's just like the Earth like you don't question that the Earth is there you know but you you need it but it's not just it's not something that you would really think about is just is the Earth is I don't know it's like yeah neutral it's kind of yeah it's neutral yeah true it's a neutral thing now it's funny like we have these characters the symbols but yeah but this is this is I think this is nice this is cool um and the circle like so and then the circle is kind of like it's a stable no I mean the circle is like the it's stable no but we said square is stable I mean not stable but like we didn't write stable but it's like solid or like is neutral ground yeah because I don't think that the that's I don't think that I don't see that the the circle is grounding I think that the the I will say like the square is more close to a physical man a physical thing and the circle is more close [Music] to um metaphysical um how to say it curve sness round complete stable I almost want to say equilibrium but that's in Triangle that's like it's kind of funny but like circle is like a movement it's like dynamic dynamic it's Dynamic it proposes it's it proposes movement yeah yeah is that namic yeah I like when um I think there was like saying in iido that um like the Stillness we're looking for is like constant movement like it's not like you stop and you have Stillness but it's like always you know in movement which makes sense because body you know you cannot stop right because the blood is Flowing all these you know things are happening so when you want to be still you have to like like there's like micro movement in there in your Stillness yeah so that's something I relate to the circle that is you know it's like constant movement Dynamic but it's like staying there in a way it's like a top you know like the circle yeah yeah that's true it's like a top when you spin it it's just staying there but it's like constantly spinning right that's how it's balancing but you don't see it like but I think you I think you have a good point is like and that that's is connected to what I was saying like physical and metaphysical in the sense that the circle is kind of like the Earth like the the Earth is is rotating is moving so and I mean and the planet is moving so fast but we don't see it because we are in the circle it's like it's something that that that is stable is a stable but it is it is dynamic but um you are part of it like you cannot see it because you it's like a spirit you are it's it's a spirit that you are in it's like the planet I think it's more concrete like the planet is spinning fast but we don't see it because are in in the planet while the square is while the square when I speak about the Earth is something that you perceive I mean every every step that you take is the square is there the square is there to support you I see like a Bas or like I don't know what's the right word for it I think it's a good I think is yeah Bas is a good word yeah is it's ground yeah base base ground is the is the base of a circle yeah like the Earth like this small Earth I think is is I think it's scale also in the way it works like in that analogy like from the universe and the planet rotating and you in the middle I will say like we are the triangle in a planet that is rotating so I was say like the triangle is inside of this sphere that is a planet and and but then they exist because there is Earth I mean I think is this this is like the seeing the planet like in this scale is Possible only because the the earth I mean without Earth without the physical Earth there is no Planet there is no triangle there is no nothing you see what I mean like the the the Earth like or the start to start thinking about the planet it's possible because there is there is a lot of Earth yeah like building blocks actually I this you know like modular I actually I think it's funny like this kind of analogy with a pixel because Square always like making with pixels yeah but I think it's that that the [Music] um it's just a bunch of Earth that becomes a planet or like if you magnify Circle then it you know starts to become like like a line right like the circumference of the yeah yeah yeah then Circle you know see like like in a micro level I don't know what sort but no but you mean like if you if you if you scale up if the planet then you see I mean that's why we don't see it round no because it's just it's flat it's flat so the Earth is flat but then how is it like we don't see the round of the do we see the round of the plant do we see the round of the roundness of of the planet I mean when you look at the sky is it round not really sure like some people say you know like if you're on a you know Tower or something like higher up then if you look at the Horizon it's a little bit like round but is it because the Earth is round or is it the perspective I think it is because it's it is yeah like because now like if I think of a 360 video it starts to you know like deform like this you know like I'm not sure if it's just the perspective or it's actually the the roundness but the Earth is round isn't it like I mean it's flat but it goes around no you can just walk I mean yeah it's just this is a it's a thing of a scale no it's exactly in a in a circle you are walking a line that it just connects at some point but it's just a matter of scale it's just you're walking a line that the circle is is a line that connect itself but then you won't see the P you won't feel the perception that is inclination uh because is because of the scaling like if you you could like you can just walk I think we were talking of this with Gabriel and that's like in K's Theory like that yeah just it's just a matter of scale like we are walking I think it's the Earth should be round isn't it like the Earth yeah like I mean that was that was the years ago it was established Earth is round yes um so I guess it's just a matter of scaling it's just like you are you are in a segment so and you keep on walking you're different segment but you are walking around yeah it's just approximation you know just driving for few kilometers it doesn't really affect that it's the Earth is round doesn't really effect but if you're flying then it start to you know affect the story right like I mean the travel distance if it's get gets longer and longer then you have to take that into account but normally like if in daily life it doesn't really matter but this is like okay this is going somewhere like like in a different place but I think it's interesting I mean I I see like because it touches the perspective and it's something that people can relate yeah this I found is interesting like I don't know if you're like familiar with like um hyperbolic space or something like so can you something um is it the right word I'm going to check but basically I'm just saying this because there are some video games that yeah I think it's hyperbolic space that basically some video games like in VR they try to make simulate this kind of space that is not flat basically like no I'm going to find some videos but this is interesting so normally like you know if you walk I don't know for one meter to the to the front turn 90 degrees 1 meter turn 90 degrees 1 meter turn 90 degrees 1 meter then you come back to the original plma right if you walked in the Square yeah but in this space it will end up in different space for example so depending of the angle or what because it's kind of like the space is kind of deformed yeah and there are some VR like video games that they simulate this kind of space I is it hyperbolic space actually not sure you you can work with unity I think it's really like you have to come up with something smart because in unity it's it's you know XYZ it's a cartisian space nonan space something like that yeah I know yeah that's why yeah you have to do some kind of like like rate tracing or something if you want to do it like in a physical level so um I don't know maybe you should just watch some videos actually like space so oh we should watch you know watch watch this movie I wanted to watch today like have you seen this thing called I haven't watched it but I think it's going in that but more Hollywood style I guess that I think it's called Doctor Strange a Marvel movie have you seen that movie No Doctor Strange I think like so it's a Marvel story but I think it is is just based on uh Multiverse of Madness [Music] strange like this is something I was explaining oh yeah so you go it's a different wait I remember this guy the V4 like we we were joking and they were talking about this nonan spaces so what is so what is an like the traditional geometry isian yeah eion like XYZ okay so a nean is it use a different references to create things it's like deformed so like if you're standing in different place you know things look in a different scale for example like this one I this one is like wait what what is going on it's just like three rooms but it's in the Square I think yeah but because it depends of the where the when the the door taking it transl take you to a different rooms yeah because normally like if you split square into four you have four rooms but here now you have like six rooms like you know but they're all Square I mean but so so I guess so like portals in a in a game engine works in that way like when you're working with portals right is there Nole yeah I think in in this case they simulate it as like portal I mean there are different ways to like simulate this but basically like portal is like one way of doing it I think yeah could watch this um should watch this I don't know how useful it will be but I think we should watch this thing all s you here like let's watch the trailer together like okay so I'm going stop this for now uh maybe we have to to reset zoom okay I'm going to just load it I mean I'm going to come back and then load it again yeah that's the way how or work evolves like now are we watching trailers of movies and is this one it's call Multiverse doctor strange and the Multiverse something wait am I not sharing sorry oh my gosh suddenly I feel so illiterate in this every night I dream the same dream and then the nightmare begins I did what I had to do to protect our world you cannot control everything strange you opened the doorway between universes and we don't know who or what will walk through it Wanda what do you know about the Multiverse this had his theories he believed it was dangerous dangerous he was right I'm sorry Steven your desecration of reality will not go and [Music] punished we should tell him the [Music] truth things just got out of [Music] hand you break the rules look out and become a hero I do it I become the enemy that doesn't seem fair [Music] Str I think the first one they seems more interesting I mean that that they get the point sharing this yeah that's yeah in in short like then if I understand correctly I mean I put it in the notes also then like I mean you can make this analogy like oan spaces will be I mean you can put it more attached to reality or like uh or like the the way we understand the world how we construct worlds and also 3D I mean classical geometrical objects and then this no uh Edan space like to a multiple spaces or like things that are not real or that they don't follow the physics that we understand right right okay know I get why like these guys were joking so much like with this like no clear spaces so wait so like a noclean space somehow is like a Sigil like from that this analogy like a like a Sigil like basically like if you use the sigil it should transort transport you through a different space like it could be one way yeah one way to see it like a Sigil is a I mean I'm trying I guess to mix things that just make no sense no like but just like reality with or like I don't know if it's reality like yeah reality with things that are metaphysical like uh and mix it with uh knowledge somehow like a established knowledge like if you use so if you're in a space in a real space but then you use a Sigil or you use magic then you are transported to a so the spiritual space so the spiritual space is just a nonced space actually it's just it's just a Knowle in space so it's not that it's not existing it's not that it's metaphysical and it's so weird it's just a know in space yeah I mean I don't know if it has to be like Ed or not but I mean in in in a way like coming back to what we where we started like because in VR everything is different from this world right and then it makes sense like in VR just think about circles and triangles and squares that we don't really think in this world right we don't really think about okay wow this is circle what does it mean you think about like that but then in the VR space it makes sense to you know like if a circle then what is this circle or like you know what's this square and that's that actually has the meaning um like we talked about it can be extra extrapolate expanded to like ukian onle in space idea as well but I mean it's it's kind of interesting because in a way like kind of what adds when we talk about ukian nonukan space then that's kind like expanding our knowledge of shapes like in a you know like in this world you might think about dog species or you know like what you when I go to Colombia what kind of fruits I find this these you know Encounters of you know new species or new um products or what ever but in the geometric let's say VR space then what's exciting what we encounter is you know different polygons and then you know you have like nonukan space and you know the lines start to become square and it became like a cube that's something exciting in that space what you would discover like like colonizer I don't know I don't know what I'm saying I don't know like I think this this interesting partly because they can go with like we have to go back and this that we have to move [Music] um on the on because of the time and and on the space how like I think time is would be an interesting factor I think could that in the sense that maybe we can start playing also with idea like maybe using clocks like uh thinking that should be from the outside like then like the then I mean going back to the practice I think one of the things that work is because we like there is this time there's this clock so the reference start uh it gives us starting point a reference point um because I mean time only it's just time is a reference point and when you start when you start becoming complicated as you were mentioning is when you're moving set in this in the planet for instance like when you're moving time zones and this because then you have to start like breaking down what is time so but time is just like the way how we use it is as a reference point to exist basically right right but I think but I think in science it is being seen mainly in two two ways one is like there is an universal time somehow there is the one that we share like that we establish um but there is also the internal time like it is close to the perception of time so that's to to Big different uh uh ways to perceive time and I mean and that you can go really into like I did that at some point like last year uh I was reading and doing something with that can go really into that but I'm I'm start seeing that the the element of time um we can use this element of time somehow at this point I think because uh I think we should put like uh so rather I will say that rather than doing in by practices normally we work a lot with black box in a way like like uh we don't describe or we don't know somehow what is happening we just do it in a blackbox way so I'm trying to invert the process here like say for instance maybe we just I think like this element of time also could be literally like it doesn't have to be aesthetically interesting at the moment but it should be present like this is what you're doing for this is what you're doing now when you're doing the videos like you're using with your you you you you're playing with that right you're putting it there nicely like I mean it's nicely done what I'm saying is like what doesn't have to be like it's just like I'm thinking from the from the outside point of view I don't know also what I'm going with this but it's to help somebody to understand what if it says like the four videos have been synced or something you know there's a message that it says clearly these four videos have been sync or like just doing doing being more literal in the way how we access do anything yeah I mean this is a little bit different example but I don't know um if I ever share this to you or if you have seen this wait a second I'm going to share it um this is like brilliant example KN each skip forward [Music] are they receiving Electro electrical impulses yeah so like a you know stimulation on their muscles actually kafi also does this um but this is from Dao Japan and basically you know everything is timed so they recorded and they put together as a montage and that's just like how we did and this is amazing this this is close to what you're do I mean is is yeah it's very interesting yeah and of course synchronize yeah yeah it works because yeah it's synchronized but then you can see everybody is different yeah yeah it is really interesting yeah can you put it in reference there like in yeah I think um okay I have to move but um I really like like somehow I don't know where the are we going with this but I'm I'm very excited and um I think it's it's interesting uh what we doing yeah quite exciting yeah we should we should do a practice yes like how like let's let's talk on that the coming days um right have to narrow down next week start thinking like more what to% for the the academy but they still does for the eight so it still there is like 20 days yeah and I think we are on track and yeah we just if we just have to continue and then it's good yeah um great okay so tomorrow then we see us each other before so I guess then we have a meeting at 3: no yes them tomorrow is at 3 yes sorry I'm imposing my European Time over you like you don't exist my mention time realiz it's at 11 PM for me that's fine I'm just like like Gabriel was like some he was like yeah he's like I'm so European like so he was teing me that like you just don't care you just assume everybody has to adapt to exactly like it's like no everybody has to speak English everybody has to yeah vo yeah um okay cool I'm gonna go I yesterday I saw a piece I saw the I don't know if you saw this piece of Briget I just saw the video like this glitchy thing right oh he yeah it was interesting I don't think it was like I don't think it was bad at all it was interesting it was interesting like the way she managed to put a lot of  and a lot of different things but it was also didn't feel overwhelming like for all the thing that she was putting in top yeah doing interesting thing yeah I really like the approach yeah yeah because it's messy also I think she like she start she a motion capture system and then she does this a very nice the way how she started like she's just bringing this thing and she does it in front of you like the The Notches like you you just see there this lights you don't know what is it and then at some point you understand ah those are the things and then she just sits and she does the ritual to put these things and and you don't see them right away but then you see them afterwards so uh in somehow like this space passing from this analog space to the digital space you're taking care of in the joury she Tak care that is like you are getting there um also I think the team that work with her like they were working real time I don't think you can do that with unity it I was curious that should be unreal because they're using Unreal but I I'm sure you with unity as well but yeah but it's a bit hacky probably because I mean unreal is made to work on real time no yeah but yeah I I don't know yeah I don't know everything is possible cool then we talk tomorrow and yes I'm gonna see today something um today something about this I'm curious to see it like she won a price last year or something this girl window is no it's young but it's kind of like it's going good for her oh my gosh what's wrong with this website I know like that's trying to be very Crea and then it's just like oh my gosh all this design studio it's up no no I don't know them but okay yep I'll see what happens okay so then so we have this meeting tomorrow at three no yep okay so we can talk before I mean I'm here so uh well let's talk in the morning I mean the morning in my morning around the same today like we see yeah that would be better like after that meeting I think I take it yeah okay yeah don't don't worry let's just we we are we are working I mean know today Sunday we are working every day so like yeah it's good that we find the workflow somehow yeah but we cannot say that for them like like this is a workflow like like this is just not working workflow is not but this is no this is different because like we are not dealing with other people that's the difference like like then deal with other people like like I mean meaning that right yeah decisions that the it just well I mean it's just a matter of you know perspective like this workflow works because you know I mean this is the best we can do so we can't do it more than this yeah yeah yeah yeah all right see you tomorrow uh thanks for the talk I that's very interesting can you if you manage I know but it's sleeping time for you if you can will be nice if you can see a movie but maybe tomorrow can you try to see that movie if you can like the first one well I'll check what it's on um I don't have any subscription any anywhere right now so but I'll try to check it out like the one of 2016 like because I think the other one is like very dramatic but the first one I think they told more about like how the world works on this thing I see yeah okay mate thanks a lot J", "w-0_Z0A4ipc": "I have to confess like yesterday I think second part I didn't record or I thought it was recorded but couldn't find the log we take we're so it's fine I saw a video like what I saw a video yesterday because I posted on my Facebook but when was that that was yesterday that was yesterday there two there day for yesterday that was recorded perfectly like there were like three parts so I put them together and yesterday there were two parts but the second part was missing and I yeah I was really sad I mean it's not a big issue as my situation right now but still like I was like oh like you know because I like to um yeah log everything so anyways yeah don't know where it's fine it's all good okay so where do we start we have a lot of things I saw uh H maybe let's do like PR practically I mean let's talk from what the what you share with me yeah that the video video I it's interesting because just we can what is the video can you maybe just share it what we talk let me [Music] check what is my videos so I will do share screen and then i' say it's optimized for video clip but no sound and goof time player there we go yeah so obviously I was doing it here and you still have to do some work to synchronize the videos yeah I mean so yeah they're like small problems I mean we have to synchronize them and also like I first tried to do it with iMovie and I noticed that you can't just put videos like together on like side by side like it's not like meant where you added to this so I used um uh what is it called FFM Peg like command line so you go to the terminal and there's like a command that like crazy command you can make uh you can write and make a grid of videos so I used it um so I but if I do it again and again then I have to think about a solution for this because I don't want to do this every time but this could be recorded in I thought like in Live LA you can do that but totally yeah if you're doing it no like in live you can just yeah if you're doing at the same time then that would work yeah but what I think I found interesting of this is that yeah yes oh no what was interesting for you can you first the the interpretation is different like there is a I mean is the same yeah I mean of course you know like I don't have any space so I had to adapt that's one thing um but yeah the way the way we move the way we drip it it's different I found this interesting like I don't know if it was in the original Pathfinder but like the rotation comes first right and sometimes like I notice the rotation is always like this way let's say but then if wait h ah okay so if you if you stretch the line if starting from dot if you stretch a line like this then you're like prepared for this rotation but if you stretch like this way and the rotation comes like this and it becomes super awkward you know instead of like this way like sometimes like if you stretch it like this and then this instead of like this I see that you were doing that and that's what I meant like that I think because this is about inter this is about interpretation what so what I found interesting is that the command is so loose I mean we basically just say like just to follow the line yeah we didn't even say what to do but because we we we we knew the the video but it's yeah just like make a point the point when there's a line make a line so I was I was reflecting a little bit of that and how could that become something something um that doesn't demand much to be said for instance the way who I approach it is every time I see a point is this is a point there a point my hands are to [Music] um but but a point can be just that right you know I mean there's so many different that there is a there's a point and the point moves somewhere and then at some point becomes a line and then then move the line and then becomes again a point and so then you can or follow the then you can keep on going with the point or you can just keep on going just with one hand disappear I mean they give so much many possibilities that one can make it clean if you know you can go in that in a choreographic place or an structure way to make it more complex but I think but the beauty but I thing is if it's uh for other people to to jump in is that it must I mean that anybody should be able to do it without too much to say it like so everybody will interpret different like as you and me we are doing but then the intention is the same I see right I mean intention or the the reference or how to say I think because in a in a way what we're doing here is like we both are speaking the same language like it's not what we doing now we speak we are speaking a language so we speak English we speak with different accent with different words and even if we are native in the language we will use the language differently each other because we have a different perception I mean we have a different uh we are different right we have a different perception of all realities and the way how we exist in the world um but we are using the language so we are communicating in in in English right now so symbolically we make use of this this with the grid what I found is interesting is really narrowed down to a really simple command and then what I found that is the beauty of this that is a video so it's not generative so it's like always it's it allows for like it so it's this is close to this what we were speaking of kind of a minimal B what is the minimum somehow it start seeing kind of this is as a minimum you can have maybe you even we can reduce even more I don't know but this is really minimum in the sense like we both understand that the we want to represent in our body a point or a line right and it's basic and it's happening in the same timing for both the point or the line the way who we H make that point or the line in our bodies or in our composition is different because our constraints [Music] um physically speaking um but also one can an extent that I guessing somehow I'm trying to go there is I'm hoping that or I I I would like to believe that if we insist in something like this then you should be able to extend this that is simple in the material way I'm mean speaking about right now if you see the video the composition the way how we approach the exercise because of of our technical conditions we I'm speaking about technical things so reality right now right um is different um if I lost bit my my line of thought but I was trying to go this is that if we insist [Music] on no like so if we have this or condition are different or composition technically are different [Music] then I yeah I would like to see how then we can start then um more meaningful things happening there in between um yeah I lost a bit my thought but somehow is I was trying to connect this yeah but do you mean like so right now in a way it's like meaningless this somehow point in line yeah it is it has a meaning but it's people wouldn't think that's something meaningful but how can we connect to that idea of like but then I think the the reference you sent me the about sigil was really interesting because it's about making symbols right right I mean what I thought like this is like technically I thought like when I was like first like my my application and and also what I was mentioning thing is somehow originally was going in that direction and I think like now somehow start coming back there that H and it's is kind of making this analogy using from sigil and from Magic like I put it in the notes like in one that from reality you when when from reality you want to move you from reality you move to a spiritual space doing magic so the action is doing magic uh through sigils and the sigils in that equation of that algorithm somehow that's what I in the notes if you see the notes I put in in in bold in a way because I'm start seeing like I think there should be things that you should be able to if you replace the words it should be possible to to almost create a formula that you can follow up um so again like so in in in in Magic it's like from reality to a spiritual space you you access doing magic so magic is the action and the and the sigils are the interface how you access the spiritual space so the magic is like the the doing but the doing needs an interface so the computer for like the sigil is the is the place that allow you to go in and out but the sigil itself is nothing is the sigil itself will be just like a computer that you don't use the sigil is there but it needs to be activated through magic right and then I was doing [Music] then the analogy of I mean like the yeah so then analogy will be then from dance so from physical dance to dance that happens in digital environments uh accessing that through magic uh evoking sigils so I make I do exactly the same I use the same is in the notes there no you can see it there I use the same thing like so yeah from from the reality so from dance physical space to the digital so the dance that happens in the digital space through magic and wait so because this is still it goes a bit too extreme to that metaphysical space what I found that the that that is interesting from the siges practically speaking is that they are figures so um I I send you also in the like there are different ones but like simple ones could be like you have a triangle a square and a a circle a triangle and a square right and so what I was thinking for I mean like that one Avenue could be in in the in the codes H so far like then you before the white line appears there is the sides okay let's me put it more simple like what if from time to time there is or a circle or a triangle you know something that is huge in the whole grid that appears said like the video is for 10 minutes uh what if in the first minute there is a triangle and then after three minutes uh I mean just a triangle that appears and maybe disappear I don't know there is a triangle that some point appears um and disappeared and then after other three minutes there is a circle and then at some point after 3 minutes there is a square so it's not generative so uh yet so it's more like following a composition line a simple line and then what then I think could be interesting is that in terms of meaning or is that the triangle then when there is a triangle it means that the way you start approaching the exercise it will be more close to with balance Harmony manifestation I don't know if you're seeing the are you seeing the link uh I have it open yeah if you there is a square like yeah so when there is a circle there is that you follow basically the instructions where it's a circle there is about wholeness Unity protection so that you approach the exercise on that regard and then with the triangle well with a more balanc more Harmony harmonies I was thinking more almost like ballet kind of thing uh when it's a square that is more ground more like a African dance something that is more grounded but you mean the movement quality I mean for example I mean that can go all the way till a an Avenue that it becomes that but like now now I'm thinking more in in the intentionality so uh I guess yeah like so maybe yes so the movement quality or like I I think will be more close to no yeah I think it's more close to the intention because what I'm trying to to I'm bringing these things up as I see it as a potential is that if the exercise is flat in a technical real but it's clear it's understood from both so that's great uh and also will be understood for audience they don't need to know more than it's very simple um so it's a universal truth then lacking meaning then my intention my what I'm trying to understand is that bringing these symbols should uh allow the people to become to make the thing unique in their own like to to give them more agency basically so what will mean for them um do you see what when I'm going with this I think like the this is like trying to use this because I see that you can put it in the Greet that you can bring them and that will be the metaphysical space how the person can create a whole history story with this and right I see interesting um I was I had like different take after reading the article that you sent me that like so there's like a Sigil making part and then also this like ritual part like how do it how did they say it um so they have the how to make a Sigil and then they have this um this sex and Dr sex Dragon rock and roll thingy how to activate Sig and basically like their take is like you know to make it like a ritual right to be like trans for example like to like a flow with the music or um yeah like music is one example um I don't think sex or drug is a good example here but something ritualistic that you know makes into like a Trans State and that I found like kind of um yeah like a correlation or relation to what we did because I don't know how it was for you but just following this you know becomes somewhat like actually it's good that it's meaningless because it becomes like ritual because the ritual is like you know following the beat or with the drugs you just think about nothing else but it's Trans State and that's something like following Pathfinder is actually exact well can the that experience as well but that's like activation part that I was thinking about yeah but so I think this is interesting but you're you're mentioning here I mean the way what they what they said in in the article so they they mention that three steps no like there the way is that that like no that's the way how they I mean they proposed like their approach what I like from the article is kind of it it is it's a theory there's a book based on this so it's kind of easy to maybe jump in almost implement or like do an analogy of what is there how are they trying to do this I'm trying to see construction phase ah no I guess I didn't get there I didn't go there but you yeah yeah I mean I yeah 15 minute okay um okay I'll check this more with more care but what I think I was trying to bring this because originally that was my intention with the application actually and it was coming from my uh from the research at motion bank because I have this ritual of dancing every morning because there was this aspect of repetition and the only way to make it kind of okay for me was to find a to start going into a ritual space in my head because otherwise was just really cold right every time there to the studio make sure that computers are on really early in the morning and then all the Cali all calibration all the technical elements to make sure that they work and every day work differently especially with a system that is really affected by light which is something also that the VR headset I realize now this very sensible with the light if you want to work with cl um so the only way for me to doing that was through in that ritual space um but I did not really dive really dep in depth into that because my purpose was in doing the applied research um for my own sake I was doing my ritual and I thought in part the conclusion that that there was something in the struggle with working with technology as a dancer that give me some peace like uh so it was for me to make my time working with technology more yeah to not suffer so much with the technology right so so I'm bringing this and and and original application was here to access the virtual space through yeah through through sigils I I mean that was conceptual idea like through symbols and it was coming because I was literally creating models no in my first cycle I was literally drawing models in a paper and then putting them in and then coding them into designer I was creating models that I then then I was coding and then after I was going with my body in the space to try the the the models the geometrical models on my body so it was coming from that place of yeah creating something that I was representing after in my body literally in with a true motion capture um but I'm seeing here somehow that this could [Music] be so I just Cod it something [Music] um here just as an idea like how it would look like and yeah it's basically the same thing but how does it look like if circle is like filling the I mean like you know it's like it's a line but with a circle that's kind of like surrounding the line are you are you there I'm here yeah is it showing the video or not you got frozen oh no are you there I lost you okay but are you seeing the screen or yeah I saw it um I saw okay maybe I just stop it now um but the idea is just you know like instead of like line it will be like circle like the line is the diameter of the circle I don't I know if that was like something you thought about or I mean what I thought was just like simply I mean I like this but let's not go there because this what I what I think is it could be dangerous go there right now is that this could become some it the interpretation if the interpretation is like from the point to line uh can become more complex I mean I'm thinking from the audience from somebody who is not here because already a like for instance already there is this lines that appears sometimes but it's not real and uh but this is a technical thing so like it's not I don't think it's or you just show it in the background for example that's what I thought like that so that's like additional information yeah just appears at some point like say if it's a 10 minute recording appears in the minute what I don't know a minute one or minute two and then it disappears it's just like a appears it stays for some seconds and then disappears yeah and then after maybe we could time it if it's a 10 minutes video like say it starts in the minute one and maybe fade fades in and out could be like for some time no not make it like that I think just appears stays there for a while and it and it so fades in and Fades out in the whole in the whole grid yeah a triangle a circle and a square yeah that just fades in and out yes just that right I'm just quickly sketch it but yeah um so that just gives an idea of like what kind of quity we should yeah but then the important thing is like some I'm not completely happy with these words like with the I think that's this is part of the storytelling and that's what I think is that because that's should Boke um meaning in each person through movement uh because that's the thing in our case what we are working is with movement so I'm not happy with the I'm just here with this words wait I'm just okay like from from the text yeah yeah so then we have to if to think for both like the ideas that they should give us more I don't know so circle circle holess Unity protection um if we think from a perspective of movement Circle protection protection so I understand protection almost as a construction uh harm almost has something like almost like manistic and a sare something that is rounded okay uh okay so I changed my what I'm saying I don't know did you well maybe you should just try and see what happens what is your interpretation of unity protection what what do you think when you in terms of motion when you you think on wholeness Unity protection what is your thought what is your thinking Hess Unity protection I don't know if I was clear but yeah I mean you know people do this as Dan construction Circle Construction triangle manistic something like ballet uh circular constructions uh protection and square like grounding I don't know like yeah grounding yeah what would it be I mean so we're just like following the lines right and then we need to have different qualities to the movement we're doing this [Music] um but I could see more likeit yeah what if what if is we could try to do it two times like what if one is just you do it just with the intention like so the thing appearing you can see it what if one is just like about intentionality somehow so like that you feel that when you're doing the exercise but the circle is there then you feel that um that you are whole unit protected you know the while you're doing that's but that's a feeling so it's um like we can say one round is about a feeling and the second one is that you try to physically represent that like uh and to see if there is like some change okay to see what and then we can see it in the recording what happens yeah we we and and and now thinking actually that it should stay there like from the moment that it appears so like the divided if it's 10 minutes like the from the beginning or maybe just give one minute nothing is happening so uh so there is not there is no Circle no triangle no square and then from the minute from one to three no from I guess two to what because it's so we use three minutes three minutes and three minutes meaning like the first minute nothing is happening from two to those quad quadr and Counting yeah sorry yes true minute one nothing is happening from two to 4 there is or Circle or triangle say maybe so from 2 to four there is circle from 4 to 7 there is triangle and from seven to 10 is squared wait yeah so 0 to one 1 to 4 4 to 7 7 to 10 yeah yeah that's what I didn't I was not getting from one to three yeah yeah zero to one yeah I was counting zero yeah yeah yeah yeah let's and then we do two rounds the first round is about you feeling so it's about a feeling and the second one is a m and the second one should be a manifestation of that feeling in your body I think that's clearit so so I can put it here second one one round second round this does that make sense so first one is the feeling yeah mean like inside yeah whatever is that because that's what I mean that's what I'm trying to do right now is like well I'm trying to not try to clarify too much right now sure that's fine yeah because it should be other people doing it that's why like the circle with around the this thing is is nice and actually could go it just can go in a in in very nice ways but it it should we should assume that the less that we have to set is the better the better um yeah so the first round is a feeling first round is about the feeling still like the task is the same there is point that there is a point you follow the point um you follow the point with your arms uh with your hands I mean there's a point you're trying to how how can you describe this can you describe it what you're doing the command what we were doing yesterday so basically there are two dots or one dot and one hand you follow one dot and another hand you follow another dot okay okay now this this is great I think we should have started from that you see what this what I mean yeah this is I like this please okay please so slow I will try to take notes because this is right this the use so one hand so this is so Pathfinder happen no right and then so so what are you doing um one hand follow one dot what one one hand yeah one dot yes and another hand follows the other dot you see the two dots  like that's now now I'm trying can you send me the link of this we have to come back okay we cannot go we have to clarify this is now like so now I understand what what was my confusion I was saying because there is one dot there is fade so there's always two dots there there's always there's one line who has a full color right okay this is only the full color only the the full one you were looking at okay H we have we have to come back we have this we have to clarify this uh I we have to come back to this uh because this is gonna finish soon so let's just come back here I'm gonna go go for a Cofe but like in 10 minutes then let's just come back here now no like now like now I'm just okay okay cool then same l y okay and wait give me yes have you been have you been in the kitchen here well during that um opening yes the the nice view you have yeah it's really funny window I have to say King this has this level it feels like King like you go here and then you give a speech is a balcony an inside balcony you see what I mean is it like inside yeah but you can you make a speech like in a communist country okay so yeah go ahead like so what what's going on with with the because there is one white what is one fate line and one full color line right the Fate ones are the previous ones and the next one the what is that say it again the previous one and the next one where it's coming from and where it's going there's faded ones okay and the solid one is the one that is you have to follow yeah oh it's yeah I know it's a bit confusing no let's like like can you just let let's and and and I like it because it's nice but no let's let's just use the one color like for now so no faded ones no faded ones okay yeah I I was actually also confused a bit sometimes so it's good that you said it I like mean that can go that's you can go and start pushing that to is a choreographic thing yeah um but let's keep it okay let's now just because if the idea I think somehow we should try to establish Common Ground so that is real and un clearly understood from both sides at least what we supposed to do uh technically speaking uh and then from there we try to put a bit of intentionality or meaning or all these metaphysical things that we are speaking and then we can maybe increase uh the level of technical complexity um like I think we should go rounds like this round round one is really clear is just one line then from there start talking about how to create meanings of this how to allow for meaning to happen or all the metaphysical conversation once more or less we go there we record then we analyze the results of this and then we can move to a second round like do we want to based on that like do we want to what do we want to do with the technical complexity do we want to increase it or how do we want to approach it again right and then because then we can follow up like we can document and understand what happens and we can speak clearly about it yeah oh you have the queer Square already cool so I just well this transitions like every 10 seconds but I will do it properly later and record it but yeah so this is nothing here and then after 10 seconds I think it will start showing Circle and after 10 seconds it's going be the triangle and square I'll just let it run for a bit but yeah so I'll perfect yeah that works yeah yeah great something that I thought was cool also yeah I think I really like that uh and it's really simple but then and also graphically looks good no and yeah but y now it makes sense that we dis disabled the past and future because it will be super confusing with all this yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I had that concern too yeah that I thought I mean this is just like loose ideas but I thought like I don't know if you saw like I I record that also with n360 and I uploaded did you that uh that eventually can you you can put your phone in a in a cardboard and check I mean just to check inside like a 360 video yeah like a like a DIY thing yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I used to do that too yeah yeah it's really fun because it was something like I check I mean I was projecting but I guess this is more like on my setup you know was projecting the the recording of was I of what I was doing no wait I I was projecting the video that I record about myself doing the exercise so that was being projected in the loop I put the camera and create a composition when I'm going there and in a way start doing the same uh but I'm but but I'm with the beer headset so in the v headset what I'm seeing is at the 360 recording of what is happening actually H interesting yeah I don't know um I think I I need to get a bit more lost in that to explain myself better like let's stay with this because this is not so confusing yeah for now it's it looks nice I really like you thanks and I'm glad that this now finds new life I made this like years ago but I think is really cool is that it actually it works now so far because it's not this is is not generative it's not a right if it will be generative we cannot count in in what is uh is imp we cannot choreograph something because a loop because it's a loop I can it just gives relability yeah yeah Al it's random and almost you can almost in 10 minutes learn the video so you know so I mean if you repeat so much you will know more or less where the line is so it will give you agency to in a way be free and then come back to certain cues yeah from something very simple so there is no there at this point there is no need to to run a generative because what we want this to no to have the synchronize us synchronizes yeah yeah which is really interesting but then then it's funny because then because at the end it's just a loop it's just a video you know like yeah just a video but so what is the end of what is the end what is that you need like do you really need to make it more complicated in the code and running and like if the purpose if for the purpose right now is not doing anything like that um and if if the purpose like is to share it with people who are not used to work with this like in a way like the ideas to to make it as simple than that you don't have to explain it basically yeah I just love watching this it's nice now it looks good I thing yeah but I think it's funny is relas that so I'll render I mean I have to I'm going to check the timing of this shapes and then I'll record it and send it to you you okay yes yes I have something in my leg I don't know what is really funny because the last I mean the previous former building was just one floor right in the academy so like every like I mean there's no stairs but now you're like you know I don't know how many stories you have like um like three levels four levels and now the connection is lost are we coming back hopefully I should make OBS that the background is Pathfinder yeah I know I should be able to do it let's try because I like this kind of stuff um just it's okay wait a sec have change this to c so now I'm just Pathfinder and and I should do filters effect um little key oh that's really crazy and H interesting okay so now I have kind of have Pathfinder myself I don't know I mean if there's like a background filter with body detection it might work better but or if I have green screen but it's okay ah because it's the rendered version that's why it has weird noise to it I could also try to get I should just get Firefox now here Y and then instead of Pathfinder this one would have [Music] filters L key wait did he send me a message or not um I think he's trying okay cool it's kind of cool oh yeah I know wait a sec so I to stop this", "t62alTyb5bU": "okay hello everyone hello just just to feel that it's not that we're talking to you but I mean you but not you it will be this funny like is this legal as part of like what I'm doing or this is like a secret state is it in part in the small t uh letters in the contract it says like you cannot publish uh you know like I think what would be worse is whatever content you make there will belong to the academy so that it will get into trouble if you upload by yourself no they take all the copyrights from you get off I still have some just control now thanks my the batteries of my uh thingy are getting my thingy the batteries of my hand my controllers of the VR headset are oh uh so you saw what I did no like with the like uh yeah and it actually it took me a while to I let yeah it took me a while to to get it to work in VR it's always it takes always isn't like yeah you don't learn I don't learn from this that I thought like yeah I will I mean it's just opening a browser yeah yeah in theory opening a browser in VR um but then it has to be streamed I mean like all these things it has to be stream then for some reason I don't know why yeah I guess there are some reasons that I willn't mention but like then the Internet connect the Wi-Fi connection is dropping constantly oh because yeah then and it's the Wi-Fi casting uh I mean it's not it's it's not casting it's streaming um yeah there were many things so at like I spend a time until I just I I left almost at 12 and you have to be at midnight here and I was like almost because at midnight you have to leave the space at midnight oh here because otherwise I think if there is I think the alarm you can trigger an alarm when you go somewhere and that becomes a Dr oh yeah okay that becomes dramatic yeah yeah but I I saw that your recording uh was time stamped like 23 yeah you know yeah at the end because at the end I thought like yeah I think I have different I think I was trying to do it also gradually at at some it was not working like I mean gradually as how I made the first videos of this week of the water um but then it wasn't it was not I couldn't do it like uh because I could not control many that's but okay that could be interesting like to then jump and connect but we were speaking yesterday like then then increasing the kind of layers as I was doing in the previous videos when I was just drinking water that was possible because I have I basically it was just analog somehow it is let's say that yeah I I was not depending so much on technology right it more a simple setup this the camera that was this is the camera basically what the only like technical thing that is is there is a Wi-Fi switcher that I'm triggering from there switching between the two pre-record images and the LA feed right the technology is only that there is via Wi-Fi there is a connection where I'm switching what is being projected at the moment um while yeah while with using the VR I didn't know like also the if it's too dark too too dark then the VR won't run in pass through and I want I I just want it in pass through um so if you I saw your hands yeah because I also realized yesterday then I started like playing a bit with the understanding the gestures and trying to make it work just with the gestures which are quite fine if you have light if there is light you can do it with that and as side note I thought like it's that's almost like a that's the dancing that's a dancing piece like trying to make work just the interface you know because you have to make you have to be physical with the interface and there's so much going on in that yeah I mean you can uh I was thinking that you can create a piece only on on that like how you can basically deal with that right um because also people can't relate to that I mean there is something on that that I guess I won't go in there but I was thinking like this is actually totally you can see somebody doing that a piece on that yeah but this is like this reality thing that we talked yesterday right because it's like a different reality where you're in and like also the body like B your body is not for this VR uh like how do I say like you have to type the URL and you know open the browser and you know set it up that's something that with a computer it's physical but with within the VR environment with your controller it's just like you know the body is not optimized for that the environment where you have to TP like type your type the URL with your controller and stuff it's not like well and you were mentioning you said that what that [Music] um that that it was interesting to see when I when I was when I lost the connection because then you could not see the image but then see the so I commented that was that was on chat right I I sent you the message but like because there the projection sometimes drops like you said like the because of Wi-Fi or I don't know reason but then I don't see Pathfinder that you are seeing but because you're continuing because you're seeing it right it's not interruped in VR but it's just interrupted in the projection yeah I'm not aware of that yeah yeah so like in the recording that you sent me I know that you are still following it yet wait I lost you oh okay I lost I lost I'm losing you yeah but then I don't know why like the connection today is not strong but be mine but are you yeah but today I found like sometimes like I was just watching videos but it was dropping sometimes so it could be that I'm G to just close my browser just in case um if there's some weird stuff happening but you know like here's like five people living together no I see like my Wi-Fi is weird stuff yeah oh okay could be also because that because they're setting things for the festival I mean there is there is happening a festival right is it already happening today or it's opening today yeah I I'll I'll try to go and see two things and I think the thing R will happen here so I will see that tomorrow cool yeah say hi to them I don't recognize them because I think I hav't when when do do I met them somewhere with you I don't think so I mean Brig I don't know if is crazy the connection no it's here the pro is here yeah how do we do this now uh spe test should I switch off videos let me try to see now I just use my my phone would work I can I mean I can use mynet personal H button wait I don't know if I should say something while waiting maybe I can just present some of my stuff I brought now should be now I mean I think now was stable stable yeah I mean I I hear you the video is coming back yeah okay I hear you yes I was just faing time uh showing some random stuff I didn't give you this one right I made Z what is that it's a te like just you made it yeah this is this technique that you printed out and you cut in the middle and you fold it like this and becomes like a little book yeah yeah I found that really difficult to this H okay but now it's yeah now we can talk okay let's so what were we saying I the the interruption actually this is funny because we're talking about the video you know drop drop drop out drop off Interruption and this is happening on our Zoom but then so I was thinking on that like then safer is we here what we're trying to do is like it's not that our research like we are trying just just to use the tool to communicate so here is not interesting I mean we need this to work right we need to rely in in in the video call yes the video call yeah this um so I I thought it was interesting what you said but then how how to play with that you know like then it's somehow that you give a glimpse of um that is part of the game basically that is basically part of the game to to to to play with the fragility of the connection right because if is because I think from outside I think it look only that there is a problem I think I think there should be hints or some or even maybe just could be like literally saying just before that that acknowledging that that will happen I mean if this is an element that that that you want to use it must it must also do something it cannot just be the the glitch cannot only it cannot only be the the the error and if what I'm trying to achieve somehow what I'm trying to research is in the The Clarity somehow on I think I'm trying to work on on being clear on or or understanding somehow that the people understand what is like our somehow the intention yeah I was talking I thought yeah I was thinking on that interesting cuz the way I saw it like when I saw your video like first thing I kind of idea I had was like What if this Pathfinder is not random but or one way could be like you know it's just video that plays back so every time you do it it's the same or it can be like you know connect to the server and server is like broadcasting to everyone so when you're doing it I can also see the Pathfinder on my computer and we're saying seeing exactly the same thing and then like so there is everywhere you mean yeah like wherever you open the website it will see it will show the same thing and then from there um for example if just example but if we both film ourselves moving with this but without Pathfinder the screen or it can be you know sometimes shows up sometimes goes off but then if you have side by side like let's say like in this Zoom right now I mean we could we can't really try it but we start moving with the Pathfinder but without showing Pathfinder then it could be interesting because obviously we will see the correlation because we're moving with the same instruction yeah and yeah so it that work because then then then intention is clear so it's maybe it's too obvious I mean it's not fine I think it's it's not bad in this moment like I think I'm more keen to make it obvious like that's what I was mentioning even like to read because normally it don't work like that like then we would work also I think at the other Spectrum more like on completely in in in in a black box we speak about the practices um so then we like to be more going to other spectrum because I know then I will naturally try to just glitch or get into the errors um and then going back a bit to to this that we talk about like the [Music] immersion yeah or evoking I thought what is what this like yeah but I think I mentioned thater to you like but what if the action for instance is that I thought like one is that every like that and you portray this into halves and then one first half the performer it's a candy and then you have this a setup with three cameras so like the same example of like the three cameras and then changing of the view so the but the action is like eating a candy and then afterwards then the public it's the candy I mean what I'm using like the candy thing is because it's easy to go I mean you have to the cand I mean when you have a sweet then your body everybody candy differently so there's a whole story that you you can make up out of the candy interesting but also but also could be I mean I thought that but also realize could be very messy and could take too long because you have to eat a candy um but what if it's like for instance like the like folding and unfolding a paper and and then um So based on the same thing like uh based on this formula almost like first like you establish something that is understandable for everyone like what the only thing you have to do is to fold and unfold the paper and but then you um you work on some dramaturgy there like you you try to put some maybe some story or some some triggers that allow for the people to create their own meaning so their own like or their their specific meaning of why are they doing that um uh because the intention with that is still will be on a boking I'm trying to mix this like with um like the dancing somehow the like the dance with the greed and the path finder I like it and I think could go I mean that can go within technology in different in different places that I could see moving um but then what how to move how to integrate the two things like the yeah one is like to evoke of how to play with the inversion yeah like that so that there is actually meaningful for the person um or does it has to be meaningful for the person because maybe maybe doesn't have you know like if it's could be that is about to understand the game you know this goes close to what we found interesting what you found what we found interesting in the losing a connection is that there is something there that is not yet solved so it keeps the attention for the AUD for us and audience to try to understand what is going on it's not so clear it looks damaged so you it it creates an incomplete line that forces you as an audience to try to find right if it's Ian I mean if it's that's what that's what I'm saying if it's approach it in that way then you have to work around that with technology and dramaturgy uh so with the choreography then to make sure that the people also understand that it's in purpose but not completely so that that is not completely closed it's something that it must stay open for the person to keep to keep the audience interested you know like if you if it's if you don't mention in any sense that it's part of the performance literally or not literally then it can just stay on till they talk with somebody after was as like ah I thought it was not working so it must be if it's that intention is uh it must be taken into consideration how [Music] to gamify because basically then you you create a game no it's like almost expl then you how you choreograph that game and give hints to understand that I see yeah so wait sorry so this is I'm seeing like the like the moving with the Pathfinder can go within technology I can see it work um but then how you how can we Implement something that are first like is it necessary to evoke something like to go to that immersive space of evoking more personal things you know like when I mention the candy when I mention the paper uh is close to this what we spoke about immersive from a p personal perspective like when you yeah yeah uh um and that is a very different space than the playing playing with the p Pathfinder right that's that's more like a that's more a code a running code like yeah like to Cipher what's going on basically right and the other one uh so I will say that in the Pathfinder approach it's about generating an uh a game so an algorithm that is there actually and then use your hiding things and then you you create with that but then the other place is more is a bit more it's an intim space where actually you are uh is you actually you're like the the performer is not creating something is the person who is creating like the meaning rises from the audience so it's not about understanding but it's about meaning what does it mean like yeah I think if if we spoke about like evoking like yeah immersion to evoking personal things or at the other side uh understanding an algorithm yeah but I feel we're maybe missing one step because if I see a show where performers start eating candies then of course I have a reference of myself eating candies so I will think about my experience but then I think first thing I would think is like why are they doing what what are their intention yeah and that comes from my experience to guess what why they're doing because they're hungry or they you know want to desert but that's coming from me but that's projecting myself my experience to their situation and then in the case of Pathfinder I just don't have the reference right if the performer is following Pathfinder then I will think about you know why are they doing but I don't have a reference of well I have a reference but normally don't have a reference so that's I think we I think weing something that that is interesting let me give me a second I understand that question mark and the other one was but like aoking immersion [Music] um but what if it's about said is like I think this is what you know somehow we're speaking about like it's yeah it's yeah it's an algorithm somehow like because what if it's like just there are two elements but then we don't know how to put them like um [Music] um what if is you are showing an audience how you will approach eating a candy or how you would approach Landing a candle or so so what if it's about like the performer like what is what happens in the space the performers show an action in the first step and the second one is that the audience is invit to do the action um clarifying that they can do it I mean somehow in that way or not but what if it what if it is we invert then and then the first action is there is something there I mean the candy is there and you tell them to eat the candy and then you do the and then you as performer you do the the action of the public yeah I mean meaning that what is happening like Technologies things are happening in there no like the the the first action will be me I will be switching I will be trying that I mean this idea of like the evoking through immersion in this U that will be close to perception no so then we'll be close to switching points of view uh so while I'm presenting the eating the candy like then I will switch I will use this trickery basically to um speak about following sorry the connection dropped I I couldn't catch what you were saying but I'm saying when I'm there could be or yeah that you can invert the the the the order or how to present the things right I mean it could it depends no um what is the they trying to achieve I'm trying to think I mean um I'm going to say something that I it's something here but I can't really articulate so what you say you're say start to feel like it's like a kind of role playing so you know like this role playing game like not as a video game but something that's yeah like lar for example yeah I never played it but you know the idea is that you have to follow Like rules and you know script and everybody takes part in um as their their role right so that's like kind of like video game but analog version of video game but you have rules um so that's one thing like could be like what you said I think there's like it's becoming like lar which is interesting in a way but then not fully diving into that but like what is like Pathfinder kind of thing I don't know what I'm trying to make a connection that doesn't click yet is it like Pathfinder lar I don't know everybody's like trying to be Dot and line I don't know or because pathfind is really interesting example that you cannot relate to but it has clear rule set MH maybe it's a reduced version of yeah role playing you just have to be rotating stretching lines but you know there there's no story behind it there's nothing like developing but is it really maybe like just maybe is then I mean now that because we understand what what was the intention somehow or what uh we are in this Loop of conversation that's why it was interesting for you when you saw it because then you thought ah you lost connection so the meaning so like the meaning pass through the technology um which could be very I mean if if we could achieve something like that could would be very interesting what I'm tackling somehow is like the technology takes away the meaning of like that somehow what I see as a Problem in Dance is that when you translate literally dance into a virtual space it fails as such uh in the translation so like the meaning is lost right that's my argue that's what I'm arguing somehow can you put it that I said it nice words we write that what uh is I just meaning is lost when you put dance in v r yeah yeah when you translate that when literally you trans translate dance in V the meaning is lost yeah yeah that's what somehow I'm arguing or trying that's my assumption um so I'm saying that the technology takes away the meaning of the dance when is virtualized in that when when is digitized in that in that way um but what you're saying here is if the technology if if we find a way how the if the technology can actually give meaning to what you're doing or what you're perceiving in reality what you're proceeding then somehow it's it's it's interesting um it's kind of reversing this if it doesn't make does that make sense what I'm saying yes and no I kind of get it but that's also I'm trying to say you know like that's why like I'm trying to articulate and I couldn't and but I guess we kind of share something yeah share something but it's hard to articulate this but that's what that think that's what I was mentioning and start seeing somehow it seems almost like a as a formula or as a algorithm that is yeah we have to understand um yeah um so let's come back to this link again the because the call is finishing the 4 yeah drop yeah but uh I I need to go to the bathroom and then I'll be back yep okay", "TkvkpKKf6qc": "okay yes he give me a second no just um there's a new Mac OS I didn't know I'm not going to do this oh yeah not going to do this right now I because no worst worst thing ever you could do now because I mean Chang to V like because you remember I was I was a boy to change it for like I think two years and I think finally I changed it when already was not I mean it was some versions already um and it took me a while I mean to make sure that all my software were working but now they change of course the  it's who it is hey what up yeah I was in Tokyo today like hour yeah yeah I sent you it's just run I have a friend of mine who is in teni I mean he was he sent me a picture that he was on the beach so I asked hey isn't it so too cold to be I mean sleeping on the beach and it's 33 degrees there what three 33 degrees and here is seven yeah normal but it's it's a big difference it's like almost degrees difference right crazy it's like when we talked about this you know application that we should fly to somewhere warm so we can save the cost for heating something like that right yeah yeah then between how much it cost like the the green the oh yeah the footprint theprint and then the or the heating cost yeah crazy and you have good heating there or no but here's I mean I don't have to use it so far I mean I guess like it should get cold but so far no because also as soon as I start using lights it becomes warm true so true yeah so so far no you saw the super video I sent you from yesterday so was it like a like so how is it like it was lagging because it's sending from the headset to the projector or yeah so yeah and also I thought it took me more than what I expect of course the time wise then it was casting from the headset to the computer yeah yeah the Ling was that that was send from the headset to the computer um yeah well it took me a while to to understand like the the video file I got the camera from that you were using the insta 360 right and it took me a while to understand ah that the that the form that I could not just right away use that format yeah downloaded did you use their their their property software yeah I think so was it do you have to use a phone or is from the computer I forgot but something weird uh I mean the Ina insta Studio thingy yeah yeah because the the I mean I saw like the I was checking uh 360 video is not related to the I mean for you to see it it's an MP mp4 file I mean could be an mp4 file or it's an mp4 file so then I just took the the insta format and I put it in the I I used the hand breaker this software I don't know you know like just I use hand Breer and then I just put it m before but it was a bit weird and it was but it was really cheap I mean the the because it's so expensive the the the original file was like for I don't know less than a minute or maybe two minutes still like 300 400 me megabytes yeah um and now I haven't done yet some file management computer so every gigabyte I'm like I have to eras stuff right so then I check when I put it in the when I just converted from the hand breaker it was like 9 megabytes I was really happy but then I see that it was not I mean when I use handre their their their editing software when I exported there as MP4 I could see it as how it's supposed to be um an mp4 but then in my in the VR headset like yeah yeah and so like I didn't really I couldn't really see the projection but uh so basically you record it on the spot and then you transfer it to the headset I record like where did you record it the video I record there like I put the basically the maybe I can just because I can I share it uh how does it work uh Academy development we please how can I I'm trying to see the because I can't see that um how can I share my screen choose select the camera no this share screen button or maybe it's in the three dot you have to open I don't know it depends it's weird reaction no you should be able to yeah yeah sorry um yeah just hold the screen for now so are you seeing yes you see yes this is what I record oh interesting but you can also like move it around like this view really or no no huh oh you rendered it so it's not 360 anymore um yes I mean this I see this everywhere what [Music] oh no have to open with a VC or something because I was seeing this maybe that's why I was seen wait so this should be seen like this right okay so maybe I'm doing something wrong yeah and can you open this that file with BLC that demo [Music] video no so it's not in 360 be right I mean there a question like because then I'm a bit confused so this is is just recording but when I put it in the in in the VR headset I see it all around but yeah it's hard to hard to say and how is the original one like before like you have this um proprietary version this thing yeah this is this one you could if you open it you can like move it around right with the play but I can open I cannot open this oh but you don't you don't have the editor or yeah now it's opening yeah oh okay yeah I guess but you first exported in this app or yeah because this should look like that right in the pr like the left side like where it has this Yellow Frame like that it should look like the rendered video should look like that this kind of deformed one but yeah but so far then it looks like this so yeah like this that's just the one Viewpoint so how what I'm doing wrong maybe you can yeah press the export and then uh yeah you see that tab at the top it says export refer video and if for 360 video so that's why I think oh yes you're right yeah yeah but it's really confusing I had you know this problem like when I was working with camera a lot and after finishing rendering you notice that it was wrong okay no but yeah that's why I don't I I see what I see in the BR yeah I was very confused but I just thought I conf confused because I'm V whatever but I guess it's just because anyway like there's an option that you can just put all around a to the image Whatever video it is yeah yeah wait I going to export this okay thanks to like so it should be it always should look like this like in the middle should be yeah some kind of weird deformation it's called a rectangle it's like the you the world map my never GRS 360 360 where is going okay so actually on today I want to try something but this is just I mean technical I have this thing you want to share stop shareing screen maybe I is this yeah I have this thing where yeah have this at some point I bought a lot of these different side different ways of tribals to month to mou in the body I remember that I was yeah in Co actually so you put this thing like this yeah you trying them not t yeah I have one just one for the neck uh but that doesn't have a a mount I think so but this one can be here so I'm curious um I'm try this and then try to move spe so to I mean to to dance a I want to dance a bit with this oh it could be really interesting because it can cancel out the rotation so again you know like it has like the sensors so that you can kind of cancel out rotation so like whatever you movement you do like it has it's not a compass but you know it's always is facing north in the rendered video so if you if you if you move a camera normally you change the Viewpoint right you rotate with the camera but because this is 360 and it has sensors like even if you twist the camera it looks as if it was not moved it's hard to explain yeah I don't get it completely yeah yeah okay so but this is so technically I think this want to explore it was with movement yeah and then try that in the so I also have a different 360 camera so this is the one from here this is for recording but I have something that I have from the school I never brought back so me so I I don't upload this video one no I have I have a 360 camera yeah uh that is it's called Rico Rico yeah yeah and the story it has just internal storage really low I remember when I they gave it to me I thought it was like it's less than few gigabytes it's ridiculous for the files yeah I have the the original one which has 16 GB but they also released like cheap per version is Rous the amount I mean for the files like it's really difficult but what it has it has a live people I mean it has kind of like a um idiot proof way to live stream more HD yeah so what I'm thinking I'm trying to see is if I can I I'm thinking like in YouTube uh wait I'm trying to achieve is is if I can see uh live streaming in 360 from YouTube I never tried it because I mean I have never I have never tried like videos uh YouTube 3 uh 360 YouTube videos have uh in in in VR have you tried them no but it should be live stream yeah no live just like a 360 video like I know that there option I mean in YouTube that there are videos 360 videos I think yeah yeah so like content so I haven't seen it in in in the in VR 360 but if that works it means that a live stream would work also because it's just a platform right yeah from not from the back not from the other not from the client side like the client is the one who will be busy trying to make it so this thing will be be busy making it live streaming and then on the other side will [Music] be uh yeah if if this works on YouTube in 360 so that you see like um uh this kind of video that we just render in it means in my head like that you should be able to see it also in the art yes right um yeah so I want to see I mean there is something there that I thought like because of the space that I I thought maybe I would like to see on that thing being in the space being in the space uh yeah around these things guess it's not really completely clear but around around this area of life and 360 H but what for like to play with the different locations or for for people to watch could be like for playing for for seeing different locations um because there that one element that I would like to I mean when I speak about like hybrid places like that's something that I would like to see if is like how I mean that's a hybrid element I don't know something around that uh but this is anyway all so this is technical so this is technical it's not completely clear I'm Just Landing um but I think around that a bit around that um yeah and I started seeing also yesterday something I was awake until 6: in the morning yeah you sent me quite late the video I yeah I got to this h of doing checking things so then I found I was playing again like with a a Medi control at um liap [Music] motion I don't know I guess I different like technical things but [Music] um but I would like to go back to what is this yeah actually there's one thing I wanted to say um wait I just opened the document and I know was something um so when I watched your video I thought this was funny because I don't know how it was for you but you know drinking water like from a glass with headset is a bit awkward like you're in headset and you're trying to like drink water and then it kind of bumps into the headset that it's kind of funny but did you notice that I saw that there was two rounds of that like the first one I I I bump with that and basically I stop I guess so the first one I I guess I acknowledged that something weird was happening and then the second one I did it I mean I adjust um but I guess like the gesture that thing could have been more explicit because I it was a surprise for me know that I could not drink the thing yeah yeah right I mean that I kind of related to what we said yesterday about the candle I mean I I was interested in this candle that you can't use in the space because of some fire security issues safety issues so in that space you can't light up um candle and you can't drink water in the real real space yeah yeah actually this is something I mean not particular person but I've seen a lot of people like having this um kind of ghost thing happens when you're doing a motion capture and you know you climb up um clim up on something or you know or like you throw something to another person but the object is not tracked so in the BR space or you know the the debug view of the motion capture you don't see any know you're just like flying or you're just like doing some motion but in the reality you're actually do like throwing something or climbing up on something so this is kind of this you know Detachment from each either reality yeah so but I think I I I should be I don't know like so I still I so this for December it should not be isn't a performance I don't think so so it should be more like an installation where um [Music] um so what is that I want to do I mean what is what is that I'm trying to share try to clarify if it's yeah I think that's the thing if if I want people to see something or to experience something you know like one like something will be more close to like then performing something and then the other aspect will be more like if they want if if they want to for them to experience something more close to what we were speaking yesterday about like the inmersion yeah oring something or perhaps could be also like a mix of both thing I mean I just think that it should be uh clear somehow like and so it should be minimal what I present and I think I should be uh clear in my head what is it somehow so for instance like could be like what I was playing the last time like when I the the First videos um and so that would be like sharing with them that and then somehow so that and then uh another think where they experience exactly basically what you said at some point that you talk with William that you said that's exactly that point like that kind of divided into one where we when the audience watch and the second when the audience interact yeah yeah yeah exactly that that based on uh and then with some words uh yeah presenting basically yeah yeah I like the idea because I think it's nice if you have one aspect of like more like proof of concept I mean is proof of concept but you know like what's the minimum interaction well for example interaction you want and at the same time you know what's like Vision you know like what's the it can be fake but something that you want to show because tech people can understand from like minimum interaction to you know kind of extrapolate but other people are like you just don't have that imagination no yeah and then what my point will be more like trying to reach the other people yeah yeah with a simple a simple proof of concept somehow yeah that will be the that's that's what I'm interested right yeah maybe like you said like you have to have the concept really clear in your head and I think that's good starting point and can be like really minimum right like what's the the thing that you want to tell what is the thing that I want to tell or why are you doing this yeah I think the why is to to Showcase or they to share the the the virtual reality is BAS I mean this virtual reality is something that we always it's just a different perception of how we perceive our daily reality I think this yeah so basically the virtual reality is not belonging is not it's not the technical thing it's just a different focus on yeah the S yeah it's a different and focus on what is happening right and why you need this different reality or perception would you mean mean um how can you elaborate the question like because you want different real well you want to investigate like different reality is that because you are not satisfied with what's in the reality or well that's not maybe good perspective but you know how I say like yeah um like for example like I'm just imagining VR chat and I don't know like why do people do VR chat they can talk to other people who is not there in the real space they can use different bodies I don't know what I I'm not really I didn't really got into it so much so I can't really elaborate but there are reasons why people do VR chat or people do I don't know what other other good examples but I mean video game is clear because you know you have like alternate reality that you can play inside BR chat is not a video game no I get it and I guess in some should be somehow to acknowledge the the proc I mean to acknowledge the um basically to give time [Music] to of the transition somehow like I think I think what I'm interested in that space in between like what is what we consider real or what is analog and then the tech techncal space that's that's what I call in different ways or a gesture or a ritual or fire or that's what I'm trying to do I guess I'm trying to I think I I think I I believe that staying in that pace because and then that's what I I use the magic and the ritual of these words that a bit more yeah they're not Material somehow I guess it's because I think in that space something meaningful something meaningful that is not Material happen while when so when you go with a in technology like virtual spaces there is no material there's there's not something material so your body feel that is or that it feels that there was something missing in that space because it's not Material you're dis embodied um so I I think that is this emptiness somehow of of I mean there is something that is missing in that space and the other Spectrum you have your normal life the one that you just so it's I would say that it's full of everything reality I think the way I see it is like yes that you have reality that your life is full and in I guess in digital environments at least for me could be different with ages also I think uh how people grow up with technology but I think like for me the digital space like especially that virtual space is not full is missing is missing a body is is missing is not full um I think it's interesting because when we say VR it's about the the environment like something that we connect to like virtual environment that you create but are we talking about the environment or are we talking about the body or both or is there actually a distinction about the environment or the body environment or space and the body because the body is in the environment in a way yeah I think like I think that's a super good point like the way who I see it like in in that is I guess that my my assumption is that I don't see a separation between them in the virtual space of the space and the body there just one thing uh where my soul is not there somehow like my spirit my my I'm disembodied in that sense in the reality I I don't question that I mean in reality you're not questioning your questions come more from existential point of view from the in that in that in that way we'll be more close to the the immersion of like I mean how in reality okay I'm trying to say two things like so in reality you can use this uh immersiveness that we spoke yesterday of like evoking things through your self and through your experiences through your Humanity Through Being Human you can create this immersiveness and then also existential crisis and so on so um um then um so things are metaphysical uh that are not some they're not Material somehow you cannot prove them of like but you feel them um and we speak about like then the virtual space then it's uh I feel that the yeah the body and the and the environment I think that's part of the problem who I feel that's that's a good point that I don't see a separation between that's a good point I don't see a separation that's my perception I don't see a separation of my virual body and [Music] the and the space I I'm not I'm not there I don't believe that I'm there like it's it's not it's not a rational thing it's weird because you are I mean I don't know if if you feel the same but my feeling is that if you don't have storytelling because a different there's a different thing that is proof in the studies like with virtual reality if you have a storytelling you can take somebody and the person doesn't have agency in questioning something right um You just Tak them through a journey and then the person goes but if you're just wondering uh then you know there is something odd like I mean you start like there is you start like yeah there is just something odd that is it not about it's not a rational thing it's just something that is like in your belly like you have been all your life living in certain way and then now you go to that space is like it's uh it's something that you won't feel in reality in in right but it's funny because your body hasn't changed from the yeah but maybe that is the problem because you not adapted to the virtual space because you carry the real body to the virtual space Maybe this is very I mean like do you have something really like I thought I feel there was something strong in that there's no separation between the space or the environment because I don't know who we say like this is comes from um H phenomenology like the per like there this embodiment like all these things lead to embodiment that that you understand that you exist I mean you don't question that you're you're not existing it's not it's not even a thought reality I mean you know like normally [Music] and I mean and also like you separate yourself I mean you understand you have this belief that you are not a TV you know that I'm not my chair that I'm not part of my chair like you have this clear separation with objects uh and I don't think this is I think you were touching something interesting here um and it doesn't have to be necessarily connected with the physicality of of wait wait this is gonna finish yeah so let's come back in the what was where were we not trusting V environment because it's not real like there's no separation between the environment and yourself and you're saying like you don't question the the existence in real life no that's that's a good point yeah you question other thing I mean yeah let's not go there but um and it's but I mean this is my my my my my experience my feeling with v is is because this is also is not like a thought it's not that you're that I'm rationally in the vard space saying like constantly consciously is this real how real is this it's just an a a missing feeling is is it's a I guess it's not it's not a trust there's not a completely trust in the in the environment it's kind of like a sus I feel like they suspicious somehow because you're because my all my senses are reacting to it so yeah so my all my senses are reacting but so I guess this is a rational thing that is I don't know is rational or irrational but it's just is this thing of the is connected with exist yeah this is doesn't exist this is not real right so I I guess somehow connecting bringing back to like working with this I think would be interesting like to show or like to so if that's the problem somehow you want to see it as a problem like that that that I don't trust in the environment I don't think it's real still I feel that it's really weird to see like somebody dancing in a virtual space um I don't think it's weird to see an avatar dancing because it's a video but making the connection of somebody dancing on the be on the Avatar or something like that I think that's what it becomes weird you see what I mean like seeing like a a video of dancing things and stuff is is a video so there's no problem and I could be nice as aesthetically as it goes it becomes a problem when a real element on that is happening like when I yeah when the a real body I think it goes to the same place of like weirdness of if I see a video of bunnies dancing and I think they're really cool and I like them and then after that I see there's actually people doing the dance U with the digital translation then I feel that it's odd you mean like a motion capture capture yeah I see but that's also interesting because like actors also use motion capture right like to like move avatars but they probably develop skills I mean it's like a perform like same as like dancing and perform forming like you kind of try to create your own reality or own or like choreographers or director reality and you try to act in that or move in that space But you're not wearing headset but yeah but I I think yeah I think it's a good point like I was thinking of um I think with actors and is that I think in virtual reality is fine as long as you're when you make stuff when you make things that are concrete you know when you have things that they already are form so not abstractions uh I mean in relation to humans let me expand or to break down a little bit of this so I'm meaning that if there is a story line to follow so something that is concrete then you follow along or if you said it feels like a the brutality of a character if it's formed let's say it's part of Lord of the Rings so is go golum is a so it's something that already it is defined it's not it's not blurry it is it's something already um the thing I think uh with with dances like Dan is is very abstract no so it's not really form um so it's not yet something um uh yeah it stays quite abstract right I mean I guess it depends on what kind of dance you do yeah I mean that's like that's why like people are so much into like B and stuff like that right because they kind of tell you all these like like fish swimming in your belly stuff like that and then create the reality I mean yeah like a reality from that kind of symbolic choreography Sy I don't know how to say basically yeah like those symbols that you try to embody it to make it real and that's the way you move I guess but then then how does it work in bu then it's like like but you know if is uh the the only I know is that they have these kind of like really concrete stories especially with like animal or you know or can be human you know can be like old person or um yeah I don't know if this example I can just find but that's the RAR three they have but is that that they're moving [Music] from how it happens like the motion you know if the motion happens is defin it like you go from point you have a b c d you have five points to go during one hour and then you know you have to pass through these five points or I don't know how this like movements are like um I mean they have like story I just opened um this like really nice website called B Caden um and I just open a page of bull uh you are aware of Bull's horns you are also aware of the Bull's weight and the hoof split into three you are dancing the wall painting at alamira Cave they are ancient Bulls as you dance you are aware of the Bull's Elegance weight and slightly wet body hair the horns turn in precisely seven directions the bull stands at dusk and it has become cloudy it is just before a storm the Bull's Head is decorated with Dalia flowers wet with the rain the bull is aware that he may be sacrificed that he may suffer pains and it goes on so yeah like they have like a stories um I can send you the link um in WhatsApp but also like in this page they have the video of the the movement of the story yeah because I think so the story and you know the the video of the actually the dancer moving with this because I think that's the way originally uh hijikata made this this repertoire writing all these stories and no he didn't even write he was just telling all these stories to his apprentices and this the guy who's in the video and made this um originally CD ROM and now it's a website uh yeah he was The Apprentice and he was just taking notes from hijikata the master of B and he was trying to learn the movements I'm just saying this because you know it's something concrete but yeah Narrows down to the movement right from the story yeah yet this is not VR it's different reality they have to construct but this this is some so this is a kind of I mean immersion that as an audience you want to pay attention full attention of what is going on right is like I I wouldn't imagine like interacting I mean you're trying to especially if if if it's boal that is so it has this space like to you want to give full attention of what is going on no you want to just basically let yourself be immersed in The Proposal yeah but the story is happening at the same time or like or people are just seeing the video I mean or people are just seeing like the movement normally I think it's just the movement okay yeah but I don't know like but could be interesting I this this could be interesting I mean what's interesting is like as soon as you wear like headset kind of VR it's very difficult to relate to your body or like the way you said was what um no you said even like no separation but yeah you were not sure about the space and but like in performance like in B they're not wearing anything but they can you know take these stories and you really immerse yourself I mean that's that's the whole point right the performers are really performers are really immersed in that story and moving and that's really real what is real the the the reality they construct in a way it's not real but it's really real it exists like yeah because otherwise you will feel I mean yeah it is it exists because they construct that reality yeah yeah yeah yeah this is something that yeah I remember when when I think I was talking TOA like two days ago that and it's connected with that is like the difference between like the fire that you fire that you see in reality and the fire that exist in virtual reality both are fire both are real in a conceptual level like um both have the properties to for you to understand that there is fire like one might burn you like we go virtual reality but for you to understand that is fire and that is not a a football it it is it must has this characteristic of fire so like in that sense like both both are real yeah even the one even the one who is in virtual reality is real until you prove that is not real I mean say like in until if you try to you can cannot burn yourself with the virtual reality fire um but I mean there are other properties that we might not have but they are real as in in a big as a concept you know as like that's that's not a dog that's a that's is a real fire that I'm seeing right I me then it comes down to you know what is real and what is not real exactly yeah I was thinking the same but then how not to get because this is I think is that's the point I was seeing that I think it's important then to kind of at least for then then the research then like it's not that is an absolute true but then kind of a state like what is more or less the reality that I'm proposing uh and what is the dance that I'm proposing because then I can kind start speaking about based on that then um otherwise you have to go back and for the constant definition of reality but also so also I don't want to get lost in that you know what I mean yeah yeah yeah right because that's yeah that's something that's your PhD like I mean that's a that's yeah that's yeah and still you don't you cannot dance um yeah so like something like very naive take on this or like idea would be like so for example dancers create or you know choreographers create this kind of reality and just for example that how can you recreate this in VR so that non non dancers can experience it like that would be like something that people so for example in BH you create this kind of reality but for non- dancers I'm not pointing so but non dancers it's hard to experience this right because they're not trained in that sense or any you can be dancer but if they're not trained you mean like in in creating that reality in believing that that exist exactly yeah yeah okay creating reality so how can you make it like a similar or like glimpse of this experience through VR but I think that's kind of too naive but I'm just saying because this will be like one option oh okay like then TR we are that then then they they they can see what they cannot see in the real world yeah but I think the reason why I don't like this idea is that you're kind of trying to like narrow down this is different experience dancers experience and VR experience they're different so if you try to like mini dancers's experience and V our experience then you know you're missing out a lot of things yeah it's inherently different things yeah I'm sure this kind of project exists already like to give the the I mean a way that that's what I was like like that was what I was I was doing I guess in my first cycle was I was trying to give Agency for the answer to move differently so to basically to construct a different body know that's what I was aiming for that the dancer you as a dancer could dance differently the from the normal body that you have then then the tool was and so that was narrowed out to that like then the virtual reality was used for yeah it it helps you through your senses to to to believe that you basically have a different body right yes it's a kind of other way way around in a way from like what I said how because I I wanted dancer no non dancers to get something that dancer would experience right you're kind of flipping you know so that well not really flipping but um but I get you know like there's a lot of connection between this like it's just it's interchangeable in a way M but then where are we going this yeah um the agency so this is yes like when when you explained uh your just now like your previous um project like it's also like how choreographers are doing right like for example also you know like maybe with the space like T around um like their I don't know methods or technique that's about having dancers to experience something that they haven't experienced yet by defining the cube or um kin spere or you know this kind of exactly yeah yeah yeah but but in that I mean that's like a straightforward at that's an um an applied response to the need of the choreographer which is exactly the same I guess what I was trying but my first cycle was creating a tool that was the point I guess was a tool for to help the person to to to to go in that state um but also a person I guess should be able to a dancer should be able to do it without that that that's that's I guess that's that's using the the entry of the virtual reality and so the connection is it was it's just more as a tool as a tool to help achieve something that is clear I mean that was the purpose yeah that's the purpose actually this is interesting because I think I told you this before but you know the uh Pathfinder from me this dots and lines this thingy um when he created like he like Mo explains it like um kind of like I forgot exactly the words but like he's you know making like a fascination of the machine that generates like new ideas that dancers cannot because you're stuck to your experience but computers it's just doing random it's just doing random geometric transformation but that's completely you know random that U human cannot do and but then Rafael Rafael hbr like you they were working together on this project and Raphael's take is more like using this as a tool so that um one concrete Workshop we did with um dancers uh in the school was that the students was that we watch Pathfinder like doing like geometric stuff and you try to follow with your two hands exactly like how the line moves and after some time you close your eyes and you just continue and you cannot say it again repeat again so we changed the Pathfinder so that it's only like like line so you know two dots like line that's projected and it's doing random movements just one line doing that one line yeah like rotation a DOT becoming a line yeah like sometimes like you know it TR like translates and scales and rotates I'm trying to do it very precise now um so you're just like so just do what I did you know just follow it watching don't improvise anything try to like do precise as possible watching the projection and after sometime they close your eyes and continue yeah yeah yeah interesting and don't improvise like you have to do it as precise as possible that how the machine would do and that was really really really interesting as an exercise yeah because because it's very concrete yeah I mean I know the code so I know how it works but for those who don't program I think it's really difficult at you know like they probably get the idea of how it would look like but what's happening inside we probably don't have access to can you would be possible can you make a sketch of that like just the two dots when you have some time like of this that you're saying in in [Music] in like processing TR if you have it I mean if you have it that will be great and because I would like to see if I can I check I think there's the possibility to yeah yeah I mean I have two versions like one is the original one I mean I have one the last year you give me one that is the complex one okay but the one that I I think I would like to see is just the the simple one that you're just mentioning just the dot becoming line and doing just just one oh I could make that like so there is web version I did so it does have like nice effects but this is like I ported it to p5js and it's doing the basic stuff with the Pathfinder but this has you know line not just line but square and triangle but I can make a version that doesn't transform into different shapes but the line yeah I think yeah so and as I thought it was it's just a point that becomes a line yeah constant and I could actually do it now oh the code is this code just that no that's not true yeah there are a lot of things um let me think it's possible to yeah I just have to do it like andom two so now yeah now it's just dots and lines and can you make that the randomness like the expand the that is more drastic to change uh the expansion of the lines yeah right now it's really small right I don't know why it is there that it changes differently how big is yeah not sure what yeah I will look into it later but well we can just like can you just can can you go back in the code for a second y I just can't process it now especially like while talking yeah no but but I guess for now can you make it just I guess just multiplied line so I guess it will all of but that's that's the thing like it has some kind of like logic that um okay so it has this line State uh random grid plus oh interesting so maybe like this let's see just thought come on why is it just this line oh oh now it's a little bit bigger but I could just hardcode it now um from one to I don't know five oh oh interesting and you send me the link of this yes you want to try to see that yeah how to make can I see it can I see it in VR yeah yeah true um send you on WhatsApp should actually work on the phone as well [Music] you you know how can I see this in full screen oh um yeah it's little bit I'm not sure if E5 just editor allows like full full screen but I can put it on the web site and you know glitch or something and I can send it to you after this call or I can just do it now while we're talking yeah I can do it I should be able to but yeah I mean this is a really nice project like I don't want to say like some about Mo but I mean the way that you know Rafa took it it's really pragmatic this is something that is interesting in there like to make somehow that thing should be possible what if the thing is what if that thing is is um is three-dimensional um what what if is a cube so so in a 3D space yeah I know that they did it yeah so this I think only like this version cannot do it but um the processing version can do it but and they did actually with VR and I think they didn't like it I want to see that like we some documentation on that the thing is like I don't know how it works with um processing and VR I have no idea never heard yeah never heard processing MBR but they did it and I don't know how I really don't know how but yeah we could think about it how we can do something that follow those principles because it must be rendered in the in the in the headset yeah yeah this would be one way like I was checking out yesterday like I mean to how to like render things in touch designer um that's the BR that's the way I was doing motion Bank well it's not made for that but if you do the what you need to to do like the coding somewhere else and you use just touch designer to render then you can see inside um okay but I think maybe like then the I I think I would like to check this in and just in 2D for now like to make it run to make it see that I can see it in in yeah so I think what it I mean I think it has potential I mean I don't like somehow also they can become just a tool you know like the Tool uh but it's really PR practical in that sense I think I still I would like to touch the the elements that we are SP speaking so I think it should be possible to create a setup where you can do both things you know you can I mean do both things like do a practical thing where people can interpret this you know like it's just really you understand as an audience what is happening also what you're expected to do and also this could be installation you see like you can just like you can think in ways how to create installation and then maybe my role or or role will be more especially you will be here I would be great then because then you could be the dancer and then my role will be more playing with a setup that I change basically doing the what I did with the uh recording like just basically changing perception of changing the perception of something that is universally understood I think this is kind of more safer is like yeah changing the perception what something that is acknowledged uh yeah something that is universally understood in this case is first you understand that this is just that it's a DOT that becomes a line and it moves in a GED everybody agrees that is that right so once agree universally then you move towards how to start like changing the perception of this and then could be in different ways uh and that and and that gives space to the conceptual layer you know like it starts from a simple element but it goes into uh more a conceptual Avenue H so I made kind of full spring version it's not brly proper but but this is really interesting because it's like the the fire you said because this is in a way it's legitimate thing as a line right yeah it's an universal truth yeah and can't complain that this is not line something that I always found maybe this is this is I don't know from where it goes but I found very interesting and I couldn't develop somewhere in the concept when when I work with motion bank is I research like in geometry and in different software a point doesn't exist like it doesn't exist a point a point is just a point of reference for something to become so uh you canot I mean a point is just a point until becomes a line or until becomes you're saying about the point the but this is yeah I don't know exactly where it goes but that it can go somewhere is that in the point it it only exist because of the is in in a in a program T designer you cannot just make you cannot just make a DOT right you have to make something with it the the dot is to is is there to be align cannot exist by itself it's just the reference it's always waiting for something it cannot exist for itself yeah I think in like um kind of more like high level rendering like a game engine and stuff it's always the case like in unity it's really hard to draw a line or a DOT because it's you know because of the dimension the dimension the dimensionality of the program or why like it's made for rendering 3D objects like you know like like volume spes yeah but like faces like the triangles because triangle has a face right it's the solid part but line doesn't have anything solid so you have to make your own Shader because drawing a line is actually not really simple because you have a thickness and you have to calculate arc tangent and so on because you have to make uniform thickness no matter the rotation is and that's something you have to calculate and this anti-aliasing and all these like tricks to make it smooth and that's uh there's like art of drawing a line or a DOT because dot you say dot but it's a circle on the screen right unless you just pick one pixel yeah and this yeah yeah yeah but this maybe like something to this you know going back to this VR topic of VR because and normally like VR uh like you know game engines or touch designer you don't draw a DOT or line you have these faces right something solid you mean you have things that exist but like you have I don't think you can you can draw a line but it's not even called a line like in designer it's just to you connect two points I mean what I'm saying is like if you try to render if you try to see them you cannot see a point but you can see two points connected I see is line I see and and then the of course like then the engine will be more keen to like you can make circles you can make you can make uh spheres yeah actually it is true it has more problems like a circle circumference not maybe not like yeah polygons like a circle in a way I think a circle is just a polygon with a infin like with many sides until you just see them as a circle yeah I different ways it te the wayold I think design is made like it's just a polygon start from three and then becomes a circle yeah or it can be actually like a 2d Sprite of C Circle there's like trick called billboarding so every time you see like wherever which angle you see it's it's kind of following you so you can see it as a it's just drawing a circle on the screen on that point in a way what I never really got completely understand the concept what is a Sprite Sprite is just a just an image it's an image yeah Sprite is an image it so is a 2D image or is a like to the image like texture so no matter what you're seeing in the space that you are you will see the image don't even rotate because that that's the thing with a 3D object right if you rotate you you know the image will be like thinner and thinner and you disappear and then you know you see this like if if it's an object like like it's a plane right yeah normally but the thing with Sprite or billboarding I don't know what's the right term is but it's in 3D space but um if I change my viewpoint it's just following all the time so it's always like square or Circle so it will be always so you cannot see back you can you see the back of the Sprite no that's I mean Sprite may not be the right word but this technique called billboarding that always like follow you like so there's no back or side because sometimes you want that kind of information like text on the I don't know you know like some something like this object and you want to have like some kind of like status of the object and then you don't want this to rotate right like in the virtual space I you know maybe I see your avatar and I see your name on top of your avatar that I want on the screen not to rotate right like this text horge should be you know like that and not not I'm not looking at text like this because it's just inconvenient so there's like a trick in 3D to make it keep the face always facing you so that never rotates on the screen and the dot dot can be represented in the same way so that it's it's not a sphere it's just a circle but it never rotates so it's a actually perfect sphere all the time wherever you look from but it's still a circle it's not a DOT I I don't know why why I'm trying to like really into it wait so going back then like then practical then we try we close we round it then did you did you said you send a link you put this you make a web you you put the sketch somewhere like the full yeah the last one in the what's up last one Pathfinder only lines maybe you have to like enlarge it or something I don't know yeah can you uh can you can you enlarge the the the web Yeah the code I think so I mean the thing like you know when I start doing this like I have to change all kinds of things um yeah because I mean I'm just trying to limit I mean it's just in V that I just have to because this I I have to see it in V yeah because I mean I here I know I can enlarge it but I don't know right yeah yeah I mean that's I have to look into like different stuff um it's really weird oh it's coted is it like this can you reload it y this is better yeah just makeshift it's fine yeah it's not perfect but it does the purpose okay let me play with this level let me see what happened with this is wait let let's check part okay yeah yeah I going to do something with it let me see what happened let's talk later hey but I think this is this is I think this could be something interesting because because I think we we touch let me just go back to the notes like just to to see so this is really touching like the universal true like um can you take some notes maybe yeah like um so I think it should like Universal true like like as the fire or like the lines like or so is this Universal true or or reality I mean as into sharing no because it's not it's not actually not to demonstrate how good you're dancing this is what I'm not trying to go you know you know it's not trying to demonstrate how good is the software but is like to make the point to make all the point of uh yeah things that we are speaking before um okay let's give some time and then let's let's talk later yeah it will it will come yeah okay let's talk okay this is exciting this exciting exciting cool uh yeah I'm really enjoying these conversations I hope I I hope I can sleep today like not going like that yeah don't go too crazy um yeah okay let's just talk later yeah yes super cool okay", "5k7zBjEPgmc": "hey hello hear me yes yes I haven't seen your space actually no I mean I have never seen actually was the space where we see the the talk of the of this Maro Marco Mar the Italians yeah cool and Grand yeah and this is just the I was working with this at some point with these slides nice two projectors that actually I'm planning to use for sure like that is that one is projecting there yeah and the other one is projecting in in that direction which I mean it's solve so and my mes I mean here have all the a lot of different Hardware yeah vs and stuff yeah I see and yeah things that I have not yeah St and yeah I don't know H nice and so let's because I saw like also answer the email but let's not maybe not talk on that like right now like no let's focus on on on this and and trying to follow up the conversation because I think it was going somewhere and that was good should we up this uh the chat sorry the video that you sent was like the practices every day over every day life cooking yeah from nid the cooking piece yeah and um what I found that is interesting I mean but I think is relevant like maybe that's why you s it is because it has this element of reality that is reliable I mean that is not really complicated like somebody just cooking yeah so it's it's easy to from something that already is established and people can relate like everybody knows what is to C then other things happening um so so it it helps to nor to normalize the weirdness of I mean it doesn't seem so abrupt like the I mean what I'm saying like the technology is fading yeah yeah you don't have to understand it I mean you can but it's not like completely new reality and also what I think is really is that is very clever because just really simple you know and it so it does the purpose like there is some basically some video effects on I mean there is a choreography for sure like there's a choreography yeah there's a structure um and there is some video effects right so it's really simple in how it's presented uh also you know it's just a projection in the back and so it's very clear in that sense [Music] um which I think like that's somehow at at this point I feel that is what it stops me is that I feel that I need to use I don't know the robot lights that I have here you know like because I have the space um but if at the end the purpose is like the people have somehow something the I mean the small or the minimal that could be presented I mean if it's for the purpose is to for the people to get something what he's doing is very smart I think yeah more that and they eat afterwards I didn't show that I sto it like one minut no I think there's no like full video but the idea is like after the show because he's actually a dancer and you know good at cooking and this is actually difficult thing when so to I think Tony he was in the video and he had to like join s or something so they had to find a replacement dancer but it was really difficult because he like the dancer has to cook and actually good at cooking wow yeah that's bit challenging AIT so it's no fake in that sense so yeah again so again you see like where where I'm trying to find what are like what did you put notes here like in the hybrid document yeah I think I put it at the top is it maybe I need to refresh maybe sure I don't know why I still kept it here yeah a yeah okay so there's a meeting back this space yeah it has to be a littleit yeah so is again like there a big a huge point is like which I think is interesting uh and I think is value that gives a brings a lot of value now is is this idea of yeah the reality what is real like what do you define for real yeah you say um you know what I was thinking that was is interesting and I feel that I think I think that we will we were ahead with what we were doing at with best practices especially when we start at some point at I remember that we have this conversation like I thought that we were ahead of something and and now I see like there things for instance like in transi like the new the new take is the thing is called content content content okay so like and from at least from what I in my head or I don't know if I share it in these words but like what we were doing in a way was like not working on content but on the medium and then the medium was given the content because the problem I mean that was one one of the points that I developed in my in my thesis in in the in the in the school that it was not about normally that approach through the technology it is high end and we approach it through doing from what we have yeah and yeah true I think we can see it in different ways like the way I see it is like like it's possible like now because the computers are good like 10 years ago probably it's not really possible and I mean also the available tools I mean 10 years ago it would have been very different or like we still had to develop something for ourselves but now we have a lot of tools that we can just download or we can go online and it works so we didn't have to spend any CRA this thing that I told you is crazy like the the thing with the phone oh wow I didn't know my phone doing that what it's like you see scanning face I mean you cannot what tricky this is such a bad I mean in terms of security is such a bad thing like that because everybody can just you know you you're sleep and somebody just put your face check if you're awake or not I don't think so wait same problem with the fingerprint right I know I think he needs my eyes open because wait show it to me you try it without opening your eyes just show it to me then I can can tell you if it's open or or does it have to like you should like you have to keep looking or I think have to no it needs my eyes open okay yeah that was a problem with the fingerprints kids finger and that's it yeah yeah yeah kids want to you know buy some apps so they just bring it to uh their parents napping and this fingerprint but it's crazy to see like I mean this like the the possibility like what I was just I was just trying that yesterday like in a flow of doing stuff I mean it I was doing the things from this uh from the stream deck was and it was working really well uh then said If if you are a guru and and in OBS on how to set up these streamings then it's just like you're just basically tapping you it's just I was very impressed how reliable was how stable was the the thing I mean for a fast run running out yeah yeah yeah remember tried it with a media controller but I didn't really I wasn't really impressed but I don't know maybe I have to like really configure it because you have to map the commands right yeah but then also you will be wired yeah exactly so it's really limited it's more like you know having the station and you know just add some physical sliders to it in that case actually you know what like one thing we did at the Academy was um there was like a web socket add-on like plugin for obs so we actually hooked up the uh flock like live coding like collaborative one into OBS so you write some command as JavaScript and that triggers different camera on OBS so with like small code you can H from FL FL yeah so set camera zero and then you know OBS sets camera to the first one set camera one I I I forgot the how function was named but um yeah I think it was working yeah we tried it and just like you know Hydra you have like array that you can make a sequencer like sequence of numbers so we did like set camera array of you know 0 1 2 three and then it just just like goes through different cameras with a like 2 second interval something yeah like kind of like a light show yeah so it's like DMX but with a camera yeah I think now what I will do here is just like the I will just use this like the normal lights I think those are cool these are just profiles like these are just normal yellow light H because I think today I will think I will play a bit more with this um but then I need uh like to have a decent light because yesterday was was just up so like I guess I will ask to just put uh just light in all the space that the yellow light goes to all the spaces wait so but before we left you were saying something that I thought about was the OBS camera stuff what last time uh wait what was it that was so I was looking for references and we were talking about you know like making those elements to make people somehow you were talking about like I mean I remember as a dramaturgy somehow like that you were mention somehow like like there is this elements but then somehow that there was there should be some some relation between how to or I remember in my head some kind of like as as a dramaturgy yeah so either like you make it dramaturgy or PE like people watching or interacting develop their own story like practice right that's so you provide some elements that has this carries the story but but then these elements must be definitely clear like I mean they a interaction of the elements that you propose should be somehow afford certain things and not everything right um because that's the whole point always with interaction is that is and when you use the sign principle is that you people are people and you don't know how they're react now so then right um yeah I mean I kind of see it like my cards because I mean it's it's quite different but the cards like what I like about about it is like people go through and you know they find what's interesting to them and that's like really but the way yeah no yeah and then like sometimes like you know they talk tell me like stories about that like what they got from the card you know what's something they relate to me or my story but it's their story they're telling okay so this I mean these that you're mentioning this is I think is relevant I mean connect something with I have a problem with this but at the same time wait um you are mentioning something that like in a conversation two days ago with Anon we talk for quite some time he he was mentioning this um perspective on immersion uh by the way like I think he's doing something interesting for the he will present something here in the in the coming days like in part of this that I will not do um and when I when I have the conversation with him he said like I mean it's the first time that he was like really diving into virtual reality he was very interesting with the all the things that he has to said um sorry so one of the one of the thing that he was saying that I was trying to mention is that he was saying like this perspective of the immersiveness like that in one hand you have this that is through a augmentation and acceleration or or in the sense of like the more the more you give the for senses to the people the more they will have in their bodies and then the other um through technology but also the the other Spectrum you will have immersiveness uh that is more close to to evoke things which is close to what you're saying saying for instance like when you read a book you are immersed and you are in a virtual space you go to I mean it it evokes things things on you that they are precious to you and are meaningful to you um and I'm relating this to what you're saying with the cards that yeah there is something that yeah the the with the the people find something they will stay there and and then becomes about them because I think that's a key L how experience like that it should be about them I think it should be about them like how to convert to converge uh in Mery n so that the people get engaged basically because for the people to get engaged um they should find something yeah did you take any notes I just I mean it's actually it's recording I mean I'm writing I'm taking notes but also is recording so and I was thinking like this chat maybe we can upload it this is just interesting yeah so if people like know like that now now is in Japan and now we're trying to strug and see what the is going to happen um okay so but something that is for like besides of anything is like that in in in the position that we are in in in in in what is happening right now politically wise but the projects is that there is no I don't see like there is operation at all like because we cannot afford that anymore like the in both I mean in both project is the way when I started speaking I started just seeing like as kind of like this is just one thing um that's the way who I perceive because everything is just so anyway this is just something I was just thinking that that um but like okay let's just stay focused like not let's not the and because also then maybe can be uploaded wait so I said about immersive as in augmentation of Senses then it's basically you show something to people or how to say this like you know what I'm trying to say that like so what I found relevant of what uh Anon was saying is that in one hand then you have something that you are perceiving and then just you take and then it becomes a a a discourse on technology and then and then just a race against technology basically that always you will be behind because always you're behind something I mean always you will be slow there was aversion every three months so if it's about immersive where you augment an experience for the people to take something uh you always will be running there um or rather than when so because basically you are you you show something to them so it's for them to take something uh what are the other Spectrum you have something that is basically they share something with you through an interface that you propose so it's an immersiveness that happens [Music] through evoking something that is personal to them right or you basically think like I like that word that is an IM immersiveness that happens through evoke you evoke something yeah so that they can relate to their experience story yeah and that should be close and that that you're invoking should be close [Music] to um re reality like a simple reality you know cooking uh your experiences of what you when you're traveling the the experiences that you have in the last 10 years like in the case of your cards you know um so it's are things that they are not yeah there's not too much creativity in that it's just like basically documentation it's just stating facts where people can jump in you know it's not it's not uh creating um a story where where I don't know when you're creating the story of the princess of a castle of I don't know like certain beings aliens or I don't know you be super creative and and in a way like I was trying to think with the best practices but the way we worked is like something that you know we don't like everyone doesn't have to you know watch everything or doesn't have to agree with everything but they just pick what's interesting to them so it's like a preference but also that's related to you know like preference come comes from their experience and you know all these things I mean I I think there is like a similarity to it because we produce a lot of contents that you know they can say I like this or I don't like this yeah because something that is clear like to me that is that because I want to hear their voices and this is something I guess that where and then when I start thinking of like technology somehow comes through that in a way like I want them through I want to hear their voices or there is an interface or if there is just a Google Document or a poll or I just that there is uh I think I want to listen to them I want to listen to what they have to say or I want that they what that the people should interact somehow that they're I mean if the things are running the people are interacting somehow so the because are engaged but that that we could use their engagement uh as part of the output then and then that generates B basically it's like doing exactly what we do but then with content then because here we start speaking about content like or like yeah this is about somehow content and I don't see a different what we do because then is what we normally do is I propose a a composition of my image I send it to to you you use it in your composition you send it back to me and that fits mine and then keeps on going in this uh feedbacks and we are fitting each other right so in sense it's connected to I mean that's the way who I see it um but I guess more in a tangible way like so more maybe that's why because at some point I said like I remember when we in The Way We Were work is because we we work with glitches that is really easy to block the I mean to just uh use all like that the buffer takes all the pixels at some point we have this conversation where I was trying to share that that I guess how careful are you choosing this is an analogy know like in their practice uh in a matrix of a screen when how are you using the pixel you know like the the decision of like painting if you see like the the screen has agreed are not passing so randomly as normally what I was trying to say is like in the best practic we we um don't we I don't think we slowed down in that that point of we just are doing things but I guess what I'm trying to that I found interesting in order to talk about composition dramaturgy and content basically is that there is that there is more sense of yeah like to be basically more like to to slow down the process and to privilege the negative space basically if that makes sense I mean or the blacks space I mean understanding from this that every pixel that you will paint it now I mean maybe not every but that the pixels now are painted somehow with a reason do that could be rational or irrational but more over also that is um is now actually involving other people like say it with audience there is an installation happening there is there is something happening that evoke for people to interact with and these interactions should be fitting the the GDs these pixels they should be adding color to the git that's an analogy okay but like you're talking about like someone who's interacting or who is watching or is like a mass I can be both could be both but in that sense I think that then then our role will be more so similar in a way how the workshop in the sense of more like guiding and helping the people to get in there um but also more to know where to cut it you know like this is something forance that in in our experiences like well uh we much into the practice and then the metal bow is passing next to the computer right so I I think this is part of also learning this that that it just demands that the the the the the role that we are taking it has more responsibility if you want or it has just a different role where you are more guiding and actually you you are the only one we are the only one who have a I mean at least at this in the way who I see it um because also it's an analogy but could be could work also physically in in in developing something digitally um that we are the only ones who have like the power of delete that we are the delete but say it as a as a a GED that is the buffer is full that we are the only ones who understand now it must be deleted like now needs to be reseted again because we are sensible enough and understanding that it the cycle is pass and it needs that it needs a refresh yeah if that s right yeah I mean I get that point but trying to think like so are there like different ways they can interact like so this I guess this is like an analogy that you said about the pixels and like what are the other other but are there like different kind of stages different mini games that they can play and then at one point you kind of clear it up and then provide something new or like what I mean could be but because I think that one becomes tricky because if we if we especially when you when you speak about a crowd you know when when it's not one to one when it's not one to five is that to evoke something you need time and Care basically you need to care for the person you need to give time um right yeah so that yeah H is basically I mean I'm seeing just like as analogy but I think this this is I think I'm I'm I'm I'm start seeing that in in this conversation I start seeing somehow like that this idea of a gesture that pass through reality or pass through uh uh sigil symbols or rituals um it really it really soften the landing on on something that is technolog technological yeah um but it's so It's tricky because it as as we said for one of the points is like um if you have 50 people you cannot allocate time to each of them to to really listen to their story of their kma for instance um but what if somehow this is an analogy like that you have 20 people because also like then I can I can propose also like maybe just parkourse of 20 people um we can propose par yourself like then then you understand somehow that so you're giving you're giving time to the person like so you're trying to invoke something to the person and once you start seeing that the person is I mean there is something that you can use like let me try to like put it like this so we're trying to extract from interviews pixels to paint a matrix that is behind a screen that is behind with a matrix and we are trying to take color and colorful uh interactions from the interviews that we have um so if I start talking with you um in the interview and I see that you are engaged and then I already have a pixel that I can put there so I do it somehow I let you go but uh you should not feel that I'm just letting pass you you know that you should feel acknowledge and you should not feel that I just need to go for the next one but I need so but but I need to go for the next one so I mean what I'm trying to show is this is the problem that we need to find a way how and this is like an analogy in this but they should this is like in technology also think should it will pass like that that and I don't think I don't think it's a problem of Technology but it's a problem of a structure so and and and I see like that this could be interesting um because the starting point this is a virtual reality but uh it's connected with a problem of with technology in general like that the they're not understanding something that um allocating space and care for people to hearing each other um so to mediate between technology that is really fast um and just keeps going fast and humans who wants to be at knowledge and care that that demands time and is are completely different uh directions like yeah technology does I see it like a fire or air and then like that talking with somebody or evoking something is more about Earth um or being fluid with water said different things but I think what I was trying to said is that because it's related with how to use the technology that maybe the technology could be used like as like the to to reflect basically the immersion basically of the person it sounds I think it sounds contr intuitive in the sense that what you're seeing as somebody who's as the person who is in in my inter in my interview is like I'm showing you that I care for you I'm your psychologist or I'm your lover or I'm something somebody who care about you or I'm giving you my time for you but I have a task which is capital or which is uh technological or cold I'm trying to separate this in a big way like as an analogy I just need to take some something from the interaction with you um and then go to the next one and I guess the bottleneck in that process is like how to move from the moment that I get the thing that I need from you how I how can I close that Loop because I need to go to the next one how can I send you somewhere that you can still be part of the process but not just okay bye next right because what I'm searching is for that information because especially in my project in this project here what I what I want and actually in the project also like in Modina is about interaction with people so what we want is to hear the what people want to say so how can we register what people have to say in a technical way you know in a pragmatical way that's what I'm saying yeah I think it's like how I was thinking about this um installation from rapael roano hammer and it's like a grid of light bulbs on the ceiling and then there's like a metal like two metal bars that you hold and it will capture your heartbeat and the light bulb above you start lighting with that frequency so it captures your uh heart heart rate and because it's there's like a grid of light bulbs next person comes next person tries and yours will be like pushed to the next one and then it goes on and on and on so say again say again so it captures your heart rate what is capturing your heart rate how the installation so you hold it two metal so you have something in like through the fingers somewhere yeah and you just hold it for like I don't know 10 seconds or 20 seconds and it registers how it's pumping and then the light starts to Blink with that frequency so you see that it's you know it's Rel related to you and the next person comes and next person tries it and it will start blink with the next person 's heart rate but the previous ones is sent to the you know next one so is a q yeah exactly it's a matrix of bulbs is it a matrix of bulbs or I mean I the light bulbs yeah light bul so then it will pass to a que yeah yeah and it stays there until yeah the new there's I don't know maybe like 100 light bulbs so we need to come back to the to the like it's going to yes think I will sleep soon but let's wrap up in the next one yeah okay so I'll just finish it uh do you hear me yep okay cool ah you're typ so tell me what I have to do so you construct the the installation with light bulbs no um but the way the reason why I said it is I like you know how everyone 's data is like acknowledged or the involvement and you can track it really and because it's like narrowed down so much that you don't lose the information and that's really nice and if you try to elaborate like if it's about telling a story then you know there's a lot of complexity to it I more things like because that's that could be something that I because I have I have the I have the the I have the sensor have with me um but just that was like just that chunk of building something physical it's um yeah that uh that can become like a a whole thing yeah totally that will be that will be for inst something totally that doable like if you will be here you know because then then we could do it and we make it work somehow [Music] uh yeah I just wanted to say this example because you know we need to think about the spectrum of you know like or like what kind of information you want from the the visitors audience and yeah what you want to take yeah I don't know so how I think that should be like this dancing with headset what is the kind of information that we want to together for people um or like it could be something like more like fluxus kind of stuff like like yokoo well she has some works that you know they start like a blank installation and people visitors can just draw on it that's also nice you know like again people can leave something and then it's still visible to people not that we have do it but um and it's that's nice thing yeah no and I totally totally follow yeah that I mean I think um so I guess from what I don't know yet how to start like going in yeah how what is how what is is what does yeah what what is that it want from what I show from what I share with you so is that is something interesting but what I want with that right right yeah that is interesting with that but then what is that I want because so I want to so that that people perceive somehow like the it's basically almost like like is a tree carry so it it is there um but what is the feedback that I want from that H right because yeah yeah so it should be slow I guess you should be bit before like more close to your cards so in in in in that so so do I mean the Beauty and the problem with your cards no is like your cards work because they evoke but also they technically wise they just go everywhere because there is not a clear purpose in that like um right and and and so that's like the beauty of of of what the card does in terms of usability of you want to put almost like as a to sell the cards you know just like to sell the cards is um is a problem because they don't have a clear purpose right um yeah yeah there's no end goal and one could be like you know make it sell to sell it and make it like collectible or make some kind of game that you can play with it that's another thing I mean it can be both like magic the Gathering kind of or Yu-Gi-Oh or whatever Pokemon cards that's why they're successful right yeah because AAR because it's a clear clear purpose so yeah so it should be seen so I think the G I think a game you know what I think this idea of the game or how to approach a game like I think playing is important yeah I think game yeah playing yeah and then there then defining what is that right in your case let's say it's a ritual then what is this ritual for and ritual can have different purposes right right it can be like you know talk to someone who's dead or you see your future or I mean that's kind of nice thing you know you see your future because the projection can be the future like how you did it or it can be the past but um or they can Define what they want from the ritual what what is that I'm stuck now what you do with what your setup so I'm I'm experimenting with different ways who I perceive basically how to perceive a body in space and time and that could be interesting in different ways depending of a setup um but that's showing something I mean that's uh I and I want to to involve the people yeah you don't have to agree but I found it's really interesting that you cannot use a candle I mean I totally agree why but you know like if you have a ritual it makes sense to have a candle but you can't have it and I thought this is something can be like used as a metaphor of you know virtual object or you virtual or real because it's you know if you light a candle you just have you can light a candle wa give me a second um that's what what you're saying and then like for example like I was thinking you know people like some people like to show like a fireplace but on the screen which is doesn't do anything it doesn't make it warm but some people do it just for as decoration or it can be a candle with LED which is I mean it it serves a purpose it's light but what does have to be shape of candle I'm just thinking because I just noticed that I mean in the note you said that you canot use a candle but this is interesting yeah yeah it can be interesting it can be not but yeah yeah yeah but that goes to the think that goes to to the place of content to to developing a Content like [Music] um but it can be just you know I mean you worked you did the video with your setup but yeah like what else can you do with that set up with a glass of water and I don't know apple and projection what else can you do what else I mean with what you have on that like not to bring something but what else you can spill water or I don't know like just just saying but you know you mean like about what what in about the action or about the setup meaning the things well like just keep the setup and what kind of like interaction that you can do with the setup that so you find something like with a video Loop what else can you do with it and but then recording that like so a different like interaction with the with the setup yeah I mean like interaction like just do whatever with you whatever you have just do whatever you can just throw apple or throw water on the floor I mean I don't know probably they're not really happy about it but you know just because I feel like now you're trapped to what has to do what you know the purpose of the object or like the purpose of this yeah like you know kind of affordance yeah like video has to be this way or object has to be this way no I know and this is good that you mentioned because then I don't want I mean because then then I get trapped in that then then it means that I have to stay on this forever and what I'm trying to find is more like a way to work around um yeah more a way of dealing with setups to create a practice because what I want basically is I guess to to to to to start practicing in something yeah um so I think I have one element that I found interesting in terms of that but then in in that practice that I want I want interaction to yeah I want people's interaction which I mean which already now is a problem because I don't have people to interact so I will have to virtualize that somehow um the nice thing we did with our Workshop is we asked people to bring something that's true like what it was like Rel from that is like the does the evoking something was through the through the bringing something everybody has something that was theirs yeah um but so that represents already a thr here now like then uh so how to do the how can they get engage maybe they don't need to have Eng maybe do they need to have be engaged Maybe not maybe not all of them they need to be engaged no it doesn't have to be for everyone yeah that's true but if someone feel like engaged then they should have good time yeah yeah they we suffering here because that's how you kind of respond to their engagement and if so if it's said in in the simple way say if if if if it's in install installation what is the purpose of the installation or what the installation will be what if said it you explicitly put like I don't know three tables with water and cups their problems with that Co and different things but then you put water and cups and you put three tables and you allow them people to go inside there's a video of somebody pouring water and drinking water and maybe bringing I mean doing things with the elements um and maybe at the same time then people are invited to do the things that they are suggested in the video but also do what they want with the elements that they they see and basically I'm follow the same structure that is basically then will be me changing the the feet of what is projected and one of one or maybe two of them will be live the people in the space so then is like I think this somehow I start seeing that that's something that I think we have experienced it I think is that um when I did this also like yesterday like in in two three hours like without really knowing how to work with this is by trusting as I think we know really we really know how to work with the streams to live streams like to just go uh and with layers know live streams and composition basically image composition by the way it's nice that you start doing the the hybra image uh Workshop I saw I saw the first one I think that's that's what I think that we have experience in doing that like in working with an image like the composition but it's I think it's empirical we haven't really like slowed down and trying to understand how is the we understand what we understand and that's the point that I think the place that we are right now and we are trying to share it somehow so then going back to the exercise I think I see me us also also more like me if you are person in the space I I think I would like you more doing and then I will taking more D over like bjing or like I see more like as a video jokey where you basically you are changing yeah you're doing the yeah you're being a V video jokey you are so instead of like putting the music you are just selecting what is that you are showing right but then I think with the setup we need to do something that is if it's just showing the video and someone doing live it's it can be obvious or it can be I don't know how I say I feel like something's needed but not adding an element to this setup but someone has to do something weird I have to do something weird in this yes and that and that's you and that's you um or like both like in in that role like that we can be in and out but like originally I think the way who I see it I think could be more like than you would be in in the space um and I will be also but more like taking that world of changing things and I mean and that that gives the possibility to take it as complex as as we want in terms of like choreographies and structures but um it should come by just practicing first because like this like but start like the start the way start seeing in my head is like almost like a chess playing you're playing with you're playing with pieces and then based on when the the the white is putting then you move the black one so there is this constant um uh chess playing um [Music] um where you know in advance more or Le when you know in advance in which direction could go um and I think that's something that certainly we can go for January uh also I think that could work in in Slovenia also um but what I'm thinking is that originally here I think should be it should work it should work just by the installation itself like you know like the element of of a person doing something it should be minimal the the installation itself should portray that and if there is the need to speak about what is and you you said literally before basically you you you you you put down calm down expectations like you know at the beginning that's something that I thought with somebody like especially with technology then you said what is this what is not and and then people are just chill you know then there is and so I think in in this will be more about it can go it has the potentiality to become like a a a full chess plane something like glitched with h Petri dis things in different ways but then I think it should be also understand the and immersive from an installation basically installation based setup but yeah could give you some instructions but but installation is still it must toou on the evoking you know like on the it must go to the immersive Place otherwise just an installation like the point is still is like to evoke it should it should go to the the perception of reality to evoking something um yeah the aspect of the reality and to question reality in terms of time and space It should be there so overos so feedback so all these elements of feedback time in future and past it should be there you I mean they must be included in the concept at least like they must be in there right yeah oh now I'm really stuck with the water so I just keep thinking like just keep like like water is just in my head but um that's that itself is interesting you know you could think about the sensation when you drink water and it can be different after running or playing sports you drink water or you just drink water while you're working sitting on a chair and you know sometimes you drink water if that's different or is it a hot day is it winter that like you know just drinking water carries a lot of different experiences and is it something like well just thinking because this is like what I'm just trying to think like do I want to make a reference to your experience of drinking water or is something that because it's virtual reality it's something that you drink water having sensation of drinking water but in a impossible way like how is it to drink water zero gravity I mean it's impossible for most of us at this point or how is it to drink water while you're drowning which is not really fun probably oh that I don't want to think too much so how how and when to drink water yeah and then then the question because I mean that's something could be like literally that is they could be asked at least like in this stage like to the person who is like I mean in this case is me like uh um how and when are you drinking water what is that water coming from what is the glass from yeah the dirty yeah and you have like a memorable moment of drinking water right uh okay let's uh I let sleep you have a sleepy face but let's s tomorrow or I really really like start enjoying this this conversation and hopefully then I I do something I think I will try also play today I try to record with 360 video like maybe a photo actually only on the space a photo and then go in the virtual Space Project that and record myself in that doing you see what I mean like taking a picture or a video of a 360 of the water uh then the action of of of that then you watch it with a BR headset headset then there will a BD headset then project what I'm seeing with the VR headset there in the main in the screen while I'm recording all the asene see what I mean I think I get it but isn't that like a lot of coding you have to do no like because I just I just have to record transfer the file in the in the the VR headset and then the I just view it yeah and then you can just view it to the directly to the to the screen yeah true yeah from I tried before I mean just projecting what I'm seeing and it works so it should work um because I was thinking also that could be something might be interesting that U you don't have a 360 camera with you there no I have two like here I should have have like but we didn't we didn't know you would stay there for I don't know how many weeks that would be actually because that's something that I thought already that something could be interesting like the because I could be I could be projecting you here you know yeah or in the project or in Slovenia as well I could ask around if someone has a 360 camera or I can borrow it from someone's where like workplace or whatever because I'm pretty sure there's a lot of 360 cameras that are not used yeah because I think through that I think that I think the 360 is a easy way to go through the VR I mean for me I thought like even before that I thought like projecting on a dome is kind of a first step that I thought originally I would like to research I did not at the end but like in the in in the places that I've been in the last few months or for things that I saw like the way how my body felt I thought Dome project with the 360 projection and then getting as an audience no like in a dome with 360 projection being there uh for the body how much it takes then after that start playing with the immersion of VR but in um 360 videos so something that is real still and not uh digital environments uh or cgis and then after like just working with that um so because it because it has this the the real element in it the real thing is there um so it's something that people can relate like it's a it's a video of the space like you don't have to go to um okay we'll see how what happens today yeah H okay interesting times yeah yes um just like one thing like it's I think it's good to explore different things but like 360 camera would require specific setup right because if you have things on the table it's probably not the most interesting thing to capture with 360 camera or like you have to like arrange it so that you know the table maybe you put the camera on in the middle and you have to kind of make um landscape around it and people can come and you know that becomes part of this 360 environment like basically um somehow you have to make you know A New Perspective it's not like it's something that you see the stage but the Stag is surrounding the camera the stage is surrounding the camera like that the camera is in the middle yeah because the purpose of yeah yeah and like if you decide to work with 360 camera somehow then then you have to think about this kind of like you know the stage design basically that works with 360 camera and it can be a good thing that you that already gives some kind of constraint of the scene I'm just saying um I I I even haven't like upload yet a 360 video on the Oculus so I need to see how yeah I think because I never I've never worked with this format but in terms of file management like I try I put other things in the Oculus before but uh we'll see I try I will try something but yeah I didn't thought of what you said but it's true of course like the the purpose of the 360 camera is to record the 360 environment the way I was seeing that was more recording basically my action say like drinking the water yeah yeah it's a camera but then then the purpose of the 360 is lost like if you just go look somewhere else um but maybe this is interesting to explore yeah just just not yeah like just this process of you know capture it see it in 360 like I mean VR headset and just try another thing and just construct you know what's interesting for the 360 and viewing in VR or Dome or something yeah yeah yeah yeah true yeah thanks thanks for that okay and you can you can have fun yeah and let's talk tomorrow okay C bro thanks so much", "uOy0fgp0TpU": "hello hello hello long time no see yeah it feels yeah some some seconds it's like just few seconds I feel like um yeah I think I I am like um how to police um I was thinking that um I was talking also with some people like coming from this uh from Elson otherwise meeting um and bath yeah that and reflecting house in other practices that I found interesting these days it's like that what we need and we don't have basically because of the system we leave is time you know like everybody needs time uh you know like um how to allocate proper time to to each other you know then if you said in a meeting that if we said if we meet like I'm already we have this space that is very trusted so how to set like okay let's meet and you know if you have to talk then just you know have to measure how much time you're taking from me you know because it's more like uh yeah I have been reflecting on this like that everybody needs to be heard um for one not to feel that you are taking time you know that I don't want to feel that I'm just wasting your time then otherwise I will have to start going in in my head like selecting boards and being effective in my talking especially in these Frameworks like that we are very uh um privilege to have where we can work but also within our work because it's an artistic reflection we can reflect on production so how to do from these Frameworks how to allocate proper time with each other what is the threshold when you need to say like okay you know what you have to work like but at the same time I want to listen um because in this work I mean the the work that we do is the art and life is very Blended blah blah so how I mean one of the strategies that I have been thinking is in if in my processes I need to go through some personal things to to put out within a conversation it's okay as long as no in with in which perspective said if we are working in Molina's project and we are working in some idea if I feel at some point that I need to put out some of my personal uh life experience um including trauma and so on it's fine as long as we think that framework of work you see what I mean okay um I think but you can you just go on and yeah like so then if you are working one idea I don't know around with the actors and how to involve new people through artificial intelligence co-pilot so we are very knowledgeable about it uh um then and then we are in this like brainstorming and or like even composing then uh maybe I need to at some point like just to start bringing something from deep inside from my traumas uh and is completely valid I mean I would like to feel in that uh in a scenario that I can't take as much time I need to unpack this because it's something that it comes down from so I have to grab it down from all these layers I need to unpack it and so it is unpacking means a personal work for me also it means it's personal work for you because you have to really listen there but it is in relation I'm trying to put it because I think it's something that we can use in work yeah yeah I mean it also depends on your position right because we're like both starting from the concept and directing and I mean we have different roles but we have the say but if for example I'm I'm just doing the programming then that might not be relevant I mean it is relevant for myself but you know if if for example you hire me to make the AI whatever then is it valid like valid it's not the right word but I I would hold it you know hold it back if to share something that I don't know I have something to say about AI politics whatever or like something related to myself and then because my mother you know she was not killed she's alive but she you know my I don't know was killed by AI you know cool five or something like that and then like you can go there 30 years in the future like we have a dramatic experience with some accident happened because of an AI decision yeah um but then you know like what's what's the I mean for for this work it's clear that we're both working in we try to be you know at the same level although sometimes it changes but that's that's the assumption but then if you're just hired to do some specific role then it's but that maybe that's not like your artistic contribution I don't know no but this is interesting because like this is I mean we were talking with somebody else like on that specifically so like the easiest cases scenario is is like in the place that we are right now because we have no hierarchy and we both are contributing from both sides so that's kind of like the it's a queer space it's a gentle space there is trust so basically in a way is there is Maybe I think in our case like it's kind of this intrinsic trust that I guess what I mentioned like the fact that I think could be a good exercise that to do more often is like to just confirm each other basically you know like you are fine you are good don't need to worry like just which I mean we have this trust right yeah so this is something that we've done we don't said but I think uh it is something that can be said also and it's just putting positive thing into into it just basically confirms Agency for the other one to unpack um yeah so but so this is like the best cases in our you know no way yeah then if you go to Other Extreme you're hired to deploy something right and so it's very extreme because you don't have all these layers in between but maybe there is what I think what might be interesting inner roles as technicians and artists on the other side um and and that said also I think that responsibility I would say more than the response is more about their response so it's not about responsibility but somebody else was using this word of their response or the then the I mean the fact that you know as a ifam hire you to deploy something I will be your boss so I I am the one who is understanding the framework uh if I will ask if I will try to enter in that dialogue there is more basically trying to listen to you in relation to work that is very specific and also maybe bringing something from me in relation to work with these two hierarchies um it's me the one who understands abstractions because you are just hired for some specific thing so in that sense you can say there is a more responsible to guide in a gentle way the conversation while being pragmatic also um does that make sense but then like I found it's interesting that we're going to work with dancers and that's like similar case that they will be hired for the project but then if they need to share personal stories experience related to the this work then that's valid you know for the dancers because they are their body is present but then if it's a programmer then doesn't really matter I mean like that's I mean just saying like it's not like you know um I'm confirming that but like people might think that you know for the dancer it's relevant because their body is there but for the programmer but this is but this is interesting what you're mentioning because that's what it so if you go like in because these are abstractions that I propose no so say like the best case is kind of like there is not abstraction it's like you and me you know things are there from time to time you can just confirm each other there's a lot of kindness in this work so but then if you go a bit which is one level up we are at least work with dancers right so then still that so then we are the hierarchy then Direction and then the dancers but as still as we think Humanities right so then the experience of the dancers matter very much then if you go one level more of abstraction or a lot of more then you have like the technician who is deploying something so there is more abstract right until you get there but it's still what I'm trying to say with this is more like I guess an intention like or start thinking towards that or ecologies of work it should be also possible I mean there should be things to say that they are relevant from one side and to the other one to make more effective at the end of work yeah that's what I'm trying to say like but then it's just of course the levels of abstraction is like so maybe not everything has to be said but there are some things that might be relevant you know the fact that maybe you have the time to have a coffee and then just unpack something it might definitely affect the work directly if it's in some specific topic but for sure indirectly just like the fact that you feel as the plus as technician like people take care of you somebody is asking you hey now how are you it's just like it's just basically it it comes down to this idea of be kind to each other that it doesn't have to be necessary in I mean is yeah it's about being kind like to each other that the system that we are in because it's based on money equals time time equals money is not really allowing this is is very difficult if we don't start thinking how the capitalism uh how the system uh adapt various more very in a very evil way how like this the system uh adapt itself within any framework say it also a Frameworks of care if we don't unpack these things and don't understand where is the negoti where is this evilness on how happening what are what is the friction what is the what is the because could be I mean it's pain somehow and it might be big layers of pain or uh uh small layers of pain but at the end there is someone Comfort is something that at the end so it is like a human discussion but at the end it will affect the work so it's not only that it's about talking about Humanity it is in relation to work yes I mean no I I totally agree but then like in real world it doesn't happen that way and I was wondering why I mean it could be you know about money you know maybe it's easier for you to not to share and just get the money do your job um but also you know but I mean because yeah I mean but but then you know I don't I don't want to use the word labor but it's also you know putting it out there is also you know it's a labor work that you have you share share about yourself with someone you know it might not we know each other but we might work with someone who you don't know well or personally and then that's a lot of work from you to just the share and then it might make sense another thing like it's not I mean this is the I think the things with buffers and like and I start like so there are two things I think I want to say like because I'm not binary always I go to these two things um like this sharing this sharing about speaking of sharing I started thinking and I'll try to not go too deep into this I started like realizing that it's highly highly privileged space for North European culture like the more you go into the North like is when people when societies are more um uh emancipated it also uh like this something that happens often in path then is is these people who can like speak very much about sharing or understanding like you know respecting very much each other's space you know like and in that sense being ineffective but also we think this care so I start seeing this like that was perhaps the problem or something that I felt from the beginning Buff when John received me and then then we have exchange and then I understood it was about sharing but there is somehow there is no necessarily an idea of we in buff we don't often we speak there is no we so we share this space but basically it's very much about respecting each other's boundaries um so I think I tried to share two ideas so one is this idea that I don't know exactly from where it goes this critique that I'm trying to express with you but it's something that I start putting myself because I'm part of these discussions so I'm actually you know we are talking of chair care and all these things that I'm sharing with you and I'm like yes yes and at some point I'm like wait give me a second this is very Nordic for me this is not how things actually work for everybody this comes from a privileged space that you can give to yourself right now to society works like this but if you come to other places like in Colombia for instance you cannot speak like that about sharing that's a very because the day-to-day is very different yeah so that's one critique that I don't know where to put is just to start expressing this is in my things nowadays especially when I was up for some days I'm like yes but wait give me some time I need to be kind of like no but that's exactly like what I wanted to mention because you know like this idea of for example just putting out what you think is already you it's possible because it's safe space that you create within work or within you know friendship or whatever but if it's not if you don't feel it's safe or if you know you know that someone will take something from you then you have to protect yourself and then then it's different right you have to like you know calculate like what's how much you want to share and you know how much you want to keep it yourself so that No One's Gonna exploit you wow I mean you touched I mean you touched something that I mean I didn't thought on that but the fact that I'm kind of that I start having some kind of um and this is just recently I'm telling you use it like just in the summer like with people that I care and that I agree with them and we are part of like a family somehow that I start seeing like wait give me some time because I don't know there is something I cannot it's just I feel there is something and could be this what you're I mean this is this I appreciate it you said this because it might be something in relation to what is that you I mean then somehow I'll feel everything this tokenization or uh especially when in place like that and the only one very often who is non-wide very often [Music] yeah but so like this is what I was trying to like let's kind of wrap out that's like that's about two things that I was trying to say this is one thing that is uh highly complicated but it's something that is a constant that I started seeing right now and anything relation also to one what I share about the allies and stuff like that yeah let's just start going into that it's going in that direction then it slowly is getting somewhere and then the other point then is um so you have this sharing that it comes from privilege um somehow but then how much then going bringing that back to work when you don't know somebody and you need to work like there's no necessary that you need to go or maybe I don't know like I guess it's more like an open thing in spaces is I don't know man this is like there is there is the need of time that's what I I think that's in short that I there is the need of time to to allocate time to each other uh and then and then regardless of how much you know each other then basically just in a human more I guess intuitive Way by tuning you you just know each other and uh maybe and you just talk a little bit but it depends you don't have to speak of in-depth stuff uh but nevertheless it's a it's a matter of giving time to to feel like knowledge um and I think that's when you have hierarchies I think so again like when you are in a flat structures it's easy because you start from a caring space um but when you have hierarchies I'm hiring you to develop something uh as I mentioned before I'm the one who's coming with the acknowledgment of the work so I know the abstractions why I need your work so it's more of my work on basically uh in a way navigating this time um this could be one way of seeing this but the other one could be also for instance like what I'm saying is that everybody needs to be heard so in relation to work so I know like from that perspective that uh for you as human working in something technical for me it will be good for them for our work environment if you can be yourself as much as possible therefore in relation to work I will try to allocate that time for you um within the work but then what happens with all the way around you know like what about like what do I need you to hear about me being me the boss in relation to the work um okay I think I think because that becomes more complicated because in in I don't know if if I my I've expressed my problem is I see somehow that as the boss uh in somehow there is kind of like this linearity of this uh [Music] um uh causality that goes from one thing to other things but the other way like I don't know then what to think like so why if I'm saying my hypothesis like is everybody needs to be heard in relation to work what is that you need to hurt about me being your boss right that's what it was and that's what the and and in this framework is when I understand when your comments you know like because it's very like exactly what is that you need to know about me as boss well I mean depends on the nature of the world but um I don't know like for example if so if you're a choreographer and if it's a performance about you and it's quite clear that you know we will have some kind of Confrontation a little bit it's about you and you know you're just putting out there about your experience the story so we need to share that we need to be on the same page right right but then if it's not about well it's somehow it's about you but you know it's I don't know if you're making an installation that I don't know I can't really come up with a great good idea for example for example if you're working for seas and like you're doing you know that kind of project and you are directing the project okay something about Art and Science for example then it's not completely about yourself right it's about I don't know something about ecology for example then as a some as someone who's hired what I want to hear from you I mean that I'm just like Reef like just reiterating your question it seems to me that becomes more it becomes more it becomes more complicated you know like because in one hand it's like it's trying to be more specific because as you are the one who is hired to do some work so is a very situated need or say like knowledge required knowledge but then when the work as you said is not about say me so maybe that information might not be relevant nevertheless it is about us so just to generating uh Collective understanding that promotes a better work conditions what are the things that as worker you need to know about me and I think still then it has to come from your individuality because every person as working will have different needs for some reason perhaps you have a trauma with a guy that looks like me you know like or this the cultural divisions so maybe there is something to impact but this is really really what I'm trying to say is a very complicated topic when it becomes like that a specific because it really goes into trauma places like they are it becomes really into uh things that to impact but then is the matter that's what I was bringing into the conversation the whole thing is a matter of time you don't have time because we don't have the money how to unpack this how to deal with the unpacking from both sides yeah but then I feel it's like you know we're just because this notion of you know time and basically you now you're talking about efficiency but this is not something not to be efficient I think it's the service but I think it's somehow I'm right now I'm I'm coupling with efficiency because I think it's an easiest way to evolve with a conversation but it's way more complicated than that that it just helps like yeah but in the end like you know it goes to this you know capitalist idea because like you know you have to deliver something right as a project that's the Assumption that's that sets the deadline and then we have to allocate time somehow so then you have to you know um compare time for development or you know creation or and also you know sharing each other's stories but then this is this whole frame is based on the notion that you have to deliver something in the end yeah which I think is a good I think you're right like if we if we make like if I make a jump into some other specific cases I think like festivals you know with festivals like in festivals no matter what the festival is trying to do to allocate time for the participants to share is never time enough like you always you feel that you're running from place to place there is always there you always feel there is not enough time for this juicy time that we are speaking here about there's always the lack of that and no matter how the festival goes so um because the festival has uh an agenda so perhaps it's not there is like it's not a way to do it uh but nevertheless could be more like the awareness of aiming for that is just an insistence on trying to allocate time which might be never be enough because of because of the problem of the capitalist system how we live there like that it cost money yeah so it might never be enough until the system is not changing so then without going to into the discussion how to change the system although I think this is how partially you can change the system so without going there then insisting then in the in the like the intentionality just the gesture because that will bring good stuff into the framework like yeah yeah or you just have to you know play with the system like like good example is like what we have been doing because you know this Project's project started like you know that we don't have a performance in the end although we're gonna do it and that's why we have you know infinite amount of time basically and that works out well but of course you know sometimes we have to change it so that we deliver something so that we have more uh visibility and money right well that man is like it's going into the yeah the College of a a larger group no it's not because of audio yeah but also you know we can still frame it so that I mean of course sometimes we have to have deadlines but you know because this for example this residency is happening but it's not like you know this is the residency but it's part of this ongoing project I mean that's how I see it um and that's kind of like somehow makes the situation a bit less um tense because if you're just like aiming for this residency and deliver something in the end something has to be good it has a lot of pressure and we have to hold a lot about our emotions perhaps and it's going to be really tough yeah well this is something that I was thinking like now that you mentioned that that this comes this this like Molina will be some kind of like as node I don't know like I know they were like aiming to put something good and in this one we will have to take decisions or another how to work around so at the end we will know if we fail and what does that mean that failing comparing notes that we know it's failed but after 10 minutes we said like wait give them a second actually the failing was the starting point of the collaboration from there hmm yeah I don't know yeah then like we have to go through like you know when we start designing process about failing maybe we can just close it like this I think yeah this was a bit like yeah going yes I like it okay no but I think it's uh you know it's a good start of the new chapter yes I think we can go more into its dramatic spaces slowly right now okay yeah yeah oh yeah I I sent you but uh I'm gonna be presenting in this dance conference education like pedagogy conference in Cologne and there will be some friends presenting also like Lily will be there I think yeah I think she's presenting the the work she's been doing around this um take care residency follow-up meeting like the monthly meeting thing that's I'm curious and also Florian is doing something I mean of course from motion back what will he present here is I don't know but I think the program is not official yet officially out yet so I'm not supposed to say that when when is that uh I think it's end of October okay so yeah so you can actually visit right yeah yeah I mean if it if it works out but yeah just saying you know just to bring some more characters to our uh Telenovela yeah it doesn't have to be drama it can be drama also like yeah yeah it should be drama I I want some drama yes so if you know Lily can be watching this so you know if you want to take take part in the drama let us know then you you know like this program Dr Phil in the states that is like it's based on in health things for people in their their lives but often is of course it's situated within dramas you know like this person like nobody to care and then now it's 300 kilos and so it is in relation to work that's what I found interesting that's what I try to bring this the idea of this drama here is like it is in relation to to work uh so it is it it is within this idea of ecologies of Labor I see but we already have a dance doctor five okay then uh right oh yeah I have to say like thank you for watching yes please subscribe like it and save your dramas for later yes and let us know if you want to be part of the drama yes more drama upcoming drama yes", "GV4GBzjL_yU": "good good look I'm Amy Winehouse today oh this is just this is just the wake up look oh it's nice I think it looks nice but it will be really bad when I try to put it out of there it's just a big Advantage right now yeah it looks nice on the camera so it's good yes what's the point so yeah [Music] yeah I feel like I really feel like I feel like anyway totally any White House and Rehab rehab absolutely yeah I know oh my gosh by the way I thought uh you know maybe I can cut a short clip and send it to John so yeah yeah we can just I mean let's see what this is going but I think we can just I think I'm I'm still into this idea of like making more dramatic in the chat to bring more juice into the the soup so who's gonna uh who are we gonna roast today the world the patriarch patriarchy yeah but that's uh that's too um mundane you know we have to talk about someone specific to be dramatic I don't know if you are if you're talking about that I'm at the lab in the school I was trying to see like because this is iMac and the camera is there obviously so I was thinking like you know maybe I can turn it around so I can show you the installation but I noticed that if I turn it I tried earlier and then the ethernet connector uh it is connected so I will not try it now but I'll send you photos later and uh so is your installation there where you are yes I mean installation quote unquote they're just like mostly prints and you know some objects and you know what we know what we are doing yeah yeah we were left to see that but we will be great and um yeah what about this shirt that you have is a fish it's super dark yes wow what a fancy shirt what do you did you get that it's actually like I think a friend of mine bought it in Korea but she didn't need it so I took it and it was like staying at my home or like in Japan for like some years and actually I asked my brother to bring it okay it's super nice wow it's like such a beautiful car yeah and it's actually quite nice that it becomes like uh you know like a disco ball when there's like light wow so I bought that jacket no like so now one one of one of the things we know is going to happen in in Modena is that we're gonna have the same garment at least yes we know one thing and artificial intelligence artificial intelligence and two jackets are there sure yes it's part of the the project yes we get do we get this budget for material we should keep the receipts I think I think there's like three I think it's like three thousand well for things yeah thank you noodle for this thank you doodle we will see you with Darlings who yeah I hope you figure out the trip somehow yes yeah I did We're Not Gonna enter in details but we always can in Avia here and come I figure out my trip I still don't know like yeah Copenhagen that I don't know it's Stockholm no slow I don't know is yeah it could be somewhere around Italian somewhere around and then some point back to dormant somehow oh yeah that sounds so funny like back to Dortmund we all go back go back to Jordan yeah so how was the impulse Dance For You oh I mean I was just there for one day I mean the opening it was yeah the opening was I don't know how to say like it's like it I have to say like it didn't really capture the essence of Doris I mean it is in a way but also like you know I felt it's like um like a pop music concert you know because the stage is you know far somehow and you know it's not like you see the the show but it's more like experience to show you know what I mean like because the pop music like you know the singer is somewhere but it's more like you see the screen I mean at the importance there was like a projection on the on one of the museums Leopold Museum so you know like you have to you can see the stage but also you have to like look uh like turn 90 degrees to see the projection of the you know the camera of the stage live yeah yeah so it was a little bit like um but you know I I liked it and we went to the the party at the Bogue theater the official party but it was like completely packed and yeah we didn't stay long was there a lot of like people from Vienna like just hit and hit it on romantic people I think so yeah it's like always yeah it's always a problem yeah not not where we went often like it's not the place that was open every day but it's at the but I think we also went to the theater like where the party happens like official party like not the garden but it's another location but anyway where the lounge is I mean yeah yeah the lounge the last year was that when we were together it wasn't somewhere else yeah yeah I know it's not I don't know uh because uh you know the the lounge was at the Garden when we were there but I think they relocated again to the to the Berg theater okay I mean it's it's close but no it's not actually closed it's actually on the other side of the city exactly shoot yeah anyways so I don't know how the experience is but uh nyansu is there and she's doing that's what it will be nice if and how how you have time to consider like to move to tally I'm thinking about it now because it kind of makes sense because now I'm finishing my study and you know like kind of like yeah I mean I would stay here for a bit longer but I mean like for now but you know I mean but the next round of uh the PHD starts in January I heard so it's a little bit earlier than I expected yeah yeah or like I thought like March April but you know I have to figure out the work plan but you know it's probably not but I guess probably you you'll have you you can just like talk these things out with no no and once once we are yeah because I think that it will work also for no no but indeed it will be different if you have to start doing that like so soon it's different yeah yeah but I think I think yeah because anyways I will give up my apartment's Point yeah and then it probably like works out well but then January means that our residency is overlapping so wow yeah it's gonna be a little bit crazy yeah it's gonna be crazy like I don't even want to think about it uh but um so yeah I hope it works out like Adidas is a nice guy it's a later that's nice yeah that's nice say hello from me okay yeah for sure but it's a practical thing so um they ask us to to to send something you know like for media and stuff with the project or the project so use me a link with the with a folder and I read it fast but can you remember right now what is that is requested from us it's like 150 words for the project and each of us uh bio that's it and the end photo that's it but they say like 800 by 800 pixels uh you know over it but but the one I downloaded from your website is a bit smaller so if you have nice like better resolution doesn't matter yeah uh probably put into Ai and wait artificial intelligence we just feed some images before and boom it makes some weird artifacts around you we just have to put like in between like interactions in with put some images of us and then interaction public artificial intelligence we're done we're done yeah you see like there is this like all this commotion going on like by the way like I feel so cool because I feel like a robot look oh wow yes I I wish I can keep this like forever like I feel like so I ready to be connected because it's probably like it's like a electrode pads Yeah Yeah from the colonoscopy yesterday but like it feels so like so cool like yeah like cyber so yeah no nobody just like I think I would like to keep them forever actually you know what I I I'm ordering some of them and uh yeah um because I have I have a gig next oh my gosh next month already uh we're gonna be like in the woods and um I'm gonna do some brainwave or EMG you know the muscle sensor thingy and I don't know how I don't know if it works but I have the device which I haven't used it for ages but I need to get those uh you know because it's single use those pads so I I have to order them like I will say when I work with this like depending if if you spend a bit more money so you if you are not maybe not the most expensive but I also know the cheapest one then you can you can have some uses for that I will say you can use it up to five times or up to ten times depends so you better maybe buy a few different ones also in the future then then we know what actually you know relation um price quality yeah yeah actually I ordered actually it was I was lucky um the ones I had is from uh what is called podolu like this Electronics uh distributor but you know basically they don't manufacture it so they just pack small amount from like they bought from like medical uh supplier and you know you just have to read the the the model or you know the code and then if you search it actually you can find bulk and that's so much cheaper and yeah I got I think we're getting like hundreds of them oh wow no then you have yeah then you have a lot of things yeah yeah yeah yeah I hope it works I mean more like the device itself because I haven't used it for ages and you have to connect with Bluetooth and install this and that so anyway like going back to like uh this thing the class requests at some point about like like writing for his oh the magazine or the journal or yeah um is those when when does he wants that oof that's a good question uh wait a second I think it's really lost somewhere did you talk to him somehow no no but I just saw like something in social media okay it's like it is within my Abus class and my notes oh yeah let you know when is that um so we want to do that or no because I think I'm not completely against that uh it's just like the labor you know like what do when is that like how much time do we have to because we have a bunch of different things that we can just select something and then just maybe just uh together like agree in what is that we're trying to set from the sharing um and then just compile something basically edit edit because we have a lot of text so edit something yeah but I I remember you have to read others and then they give feedback and stuff oh yeah I don't remember I think that's the thing so I don't think he writes anything about the deadline no doesn't have the deadline so what it says could you read it it's quite long so it's like I'm not just like don't read my messages like share what you think is relevant from this conversation wait wait what's from the email uh it would be nice to contact around six to eight peers who are doing research production continue to work in one way or another and dance and dance arts and creative software engineering uh I want to start a data feed this is an ongoing stream of structured information that provides users with updates of current information from one or more sources [Music] I will provide half of the participants with a written reflection on my personal research experiences conversing somatic and technological perspectives and artistic dance research well I want to ask the artists and researchers to react on that from their own perspective and practices I also forward them to the second half of the artist researchers where they then reacts to The Continuous feed that way we could come to a more Dynamic shape of the overall particles so basically he's going to send out to half of the people and they will react to it and the other half will react to the reaction okay yeah but in that sense so it's not that he's requesting like you guys please submit something it's just more like you know something I'm reflecting on this how the group affecting this and then based on the reflection the other half will reflect on the reflection no and he's saying that I'm expecting no word count let me just like you know trying to say that it's not like labor intensive but it's the labor um yeah but I feel like he's you know just trying out something but I mean maybe if you can or because I cannot doesn't have to be right now like I mean send me one line I mean if you're interested no uh but my mom I think my feeling on this is like I would like to be part of it um but then it's I don't know I mean on I mean I would like to be part of the initial idea to see how it goes and then based on that just uh based on the how busy I feel I am then um then I guess I will continue with the exercise or not and that's it also then I would like them to underline that I would like to do that more as a Duo uh more based on best practices um like then we together in a way reflect together in a chat and then just put down a paragraph or something um if that's possible yeah I mean that's actually a good point because I mean for me like I would like to support with what I can but you know I can't take more things right now like it's time just like completely overloaded and I don't have money so I have to really work um and our residency is also coming up like it's you know soon uh more you know sooner than what we think and if I do phds it's just gonna be like crazy so but then what you said is I think it's interesting if we could do it like a chat for example you know yeah writing because that's like the kind of looking part if we just say you know like just spend like half an hour one hour just talking I feel that's true like and then it's just up to class but what he does with the child yeah yeah not that that's good to me um yeah I think that's that's kind of like organic way to go through because basically anyway in a child we will speak about it so we just like Focus uh like say maybe not going for one hour but we say look for half an hour we try yeah I fail but we try to speak about the topic yeah who's gonna write yeah uh if you could do that because I mean like for me just takes so long to just to write two lines of you know yeah I mean yeah this is like already something to you know have you have to think um I'll just yeah like I would write something quick like not um yeah not like proposing something concrete but because then we really have to organize something but just something General in interest yes yes do you like that yeah that sounds good yeah there is not a compromise somehow from our side like just general interest yeah thank you good we might get rich from that side okay so so what else are the practical things uh so the Modina thing like how do we do it before we move before we move I just want to acknowledge that I'm kind of happy that we didn't have that precedence in uh in nrw nor WR uh uh in Germany because that will be crazy right now to imagine that will be just bananas like no imagine just like wow no way I cannot so things happen for a reason um yes it's nice that we're selected for the morina thing there was like almost 100 projects and we were the number six out of five we're going to number six and five yeah so it's like a joker yeah it's great that we this it sounds great the project and I'm really looking forward but also because of no no no it's great no that's great I love it yeah [Music] um yeah uh something what else like what else so I guess we have to maybe the next week when are you done with your with your school presentation oh my gosh like I just think that I'm booked for the next like until the end of uh beginning of September like seriously but but we have we have to think then uh we have to find a way how to then do the Molina thing it's not too much but just no it's not too much and I already put the text from the application basically um I can put the link but we don't have to do it now now no no no yeah let's just like just find a different moment when we just do this exercise of on that because we can solve it uh I mean I do my party do your part but uh also it's not always uh he said mid-august no or something so like mid-august like oh we just do it in the coming maybe next week if you can or the week after just to see do the half an hour um meeting a chat where we just do that yeah but I think it's good uh anyways if you go through and then you know just tell me you know if we need some time to do it together or if we do it asynchronously or something because yeah you mean that a check what is in the folder yeah I mean in the the dog basically because yeah the text is from the application like our series and you know the project summary I will do that and once that once I okay let's put it somewhere here because this is I will do it's not working if I don't put it somewhere uh [Music] more than us yeah man I completely forgot like I was part of a jury of motion Bank um for the for the CCS oh yeah it was and so I completely forgot that it was it's weird out so I forgot that I have an important minute with seeds that I agreed the last Wednesday one week ago that we will have it on Friday for things of Zurich like practical things uh and also the last Friday that I have no no that the I have um Wednesday early so yesterday now two days ago early part of this jewelry thing and that was uh yeah weird that I I mean just just being in puff you know like you get like what I thought I put it somewhere in my schedule so that's what I mentioned in this like this because I just put it somewhere that I know is there otherwise it's disappeared the bill started it's noon now so yeah or maybe let's say this maybe we put this link to the doc uh from Modena in the YouTube and people can edit it for us well that would be great well that that's Nike is a strategy to for [Music] um uh branding so why not to do that like then just like put it people write a what he needs yes you can be part of our paintbox okay what else is in the agenda I don't know did we just celebrate John oh yes yes so here's the satellite event because nowadays everyone will do the that's the satellite event we are celebrating Jan's birthday I don't know how old is she um next year is a big one that's the confusing information let's say okay let's use a good one but that means different different cultures so we don't know what is it true um so from the bottom of my heart Happy feliz cumpleanos yes how do you say it in Italian because she speaks Italian um [Music] this is French I guess but I don't think they say it in Quebec anyways happy birthday happy birthday I'll just cut this part and send it how you said in Germany [Music] actually wait what oh my gosh I forgot no it's good it's just uh that sounds like anything yeah what is it actually yes something give us that is in Italian [Music] probably probably I will be um in the I can't say Blacklist I can't enter Italy if I do if I say this but it's really sounds like a combination of French and Spanish I have an allergy is this I think this is part is still of Jan's satellite event because I was about to start talking about my armpit and so maybe it's not the topic for her birthday or maybe it is a topic for her birthday to talk about my RP and why my left armpit smells weed I don't get it like it's like my right one is you know because I have some kind of allergy since I don't know why Suri gave me that but I have this allergy so now that I'm back in Brussels I'm trying not to use deodorant so now I feel this constant thing and to the right it's kind of like it's it's just something but in the left side it smells wheat like if I smoke tons of wheat like this I don't know how come so yeah uh I hope that was a nice topic for your birthday I hope you enjoyed that yeah they're not so bad I mean it's weird if you like weed maybe you like me that's a good uh selling point so yeah like what is your selling point my left armpit smells good because it does yours good um we can close this I think has been prolific yes very condensed yes uh let's keep on living and I'm just I'm just arriving there are so many things that yes keep on living oh the connection we have to do that one time like just check when when it's possible and then just test check out doesn't have to be it's just a practice you know would be good like you have to go to back to the body oh yeah yeah sure go practice to the practice and yeah there are so many insights personal that you know from you know and stuff for my travel around uh uh Suri yeah everywhere but damn let's just do it another moment um all right uh I hope also you're good I hope your brothers good um yeah keep in touch man thanks and yes okay final wars whatever uh oh my gosh I'm just so tired I'm gonna oh yeah you know something I know words I'm so tired I'm so tired yeah I'm gonna meet uh uh Luis from uh he's visiting from Colombia he's the one who's used to study here and he's teaching at the University of Bogota and he's here he's visiting so we're gonna have lunch nice yes so I'm looking forward to beat more Colombians when maricas and maricons mad because maricons that's tricky like because it is like maricon is really tricky because the context you don't say that I never heard it I mean like yeah the maricon is like you know with a close friend like we just said rarely like so like let's say in short it's like you don't say that yeah no yeah you just don't say maricon is bad okay so yeah so let's see you maricon Marika yet all right so I want to love peace", "Kb1X13JXb3w": "yes hello everyone or whatever hello whatever or we're just talking to the Boyd what up uh how are you doing I was about to say I'm feeling better but this morning not so much but I'm okay and um oh yeah yesterday I did this uh nail salon oh yeah how was it good I actually like so in the end in like two hours there are like five people and I started to feel like this is like more like a therapy for myself you know like having people come and just like talk with them which is like it's like therapeutic in a way and it's just taking time painting their nails I mean everyone's happy that they're nails done but I was also like thinking I mean I was it's very tiring practice but I was also thinking like wow like this is like like for me it's like a moment when I sit down and you know just talk with some other people visiting me but then the people I mean just people that start talking with about their things or yeah I mean it depends on the persons like some people like to talk other people I would you know ask some questions I mean just random stuff but you know like most of them are students like one of them was a teacher from the school and others were students but you know like most of them like I have I don't really like have time like talking with them like because we just meet at the seminars you know right and right yeah everyone's busy I'm not busy right now well at the school but yeah running around so so but this was part of your you finish everything at your school right now right yeah another part of this is not part of your grades but you're what do you need no I I cannot uh get uh anything for this I mean I'm just like starting to do this like as a practice thing for the final showing in July and I want to iterate a little bit before that yeah because at the end you have to show something which will be uh something similar to what you did yeah like I was thinking like yeah I mean this is also like very related to like all these problems we're having at school right now um I don't know how I don't know if we talked about it but like for example um there was it's not even sexual harassment and sexual assault to one of the students and so between can you specify like so between the students or robot I think it's between students I mean I mean it's very like problematic the incident itself but also the school tried to like you know not make it uh you know like big thing about it so they try to like not to hide and conceal that but it it gave that impression especially when the victim had to talk about this like she sent email to the the public group about the incident because nobody was like there was no like proper like information from the school about what happened or like any follow-up wow yeah that was really really nasty yeah and there's another problem with uh Professor who was fired um and it's it's really questionable like he was like sending like emails that was it was quite provocative like in a way that um like he was not using like right words um like basically complaining about the administration about the school which is you know which is fair but then he was using words about like Nazi and stuff like that and that became like problem in itself and then the school this the director decided to fire him because of this issue and this is also you know like very questionable like okay like I I was like really annoyed by all these like drama with the emails but at the same time like just because of that firing a professor and you know people like comparing this to another case which happened like a couple of years ago when it was around the time I started basically there's a professor who did sexual harassment and the school couldn't fire him because of the contract oh yeah wow yeah I stayed and that was really really nasty um but I think something I heard is because of that incident now they have the conflict this when they sign the contract is a clause that um I don't know exactly what it is but basically the school can fire the professor or lecturer if there's something like a problem like this regardless of their seniorship yeah but but then again you know like I don't know what the exact condition but you know based on this email and then like the Rector decided to fire him it's like it's a it's you know that's not really cool it's a little bit um I mean like we need information in any case like there was no really like information and also this uh the fact that they fired him they K it came from the professor who was fired and not there's no official announcement from the school I was like again you know there's no like communication from the school which is like probably there is for the the employees but not to the students at least and just you know so what I want to say is like all these problems like happening and I was really like you know reluctant to do something big for the final showing like I then I thought about like I had to like talk with others like some of the professors and basically like one idea is to boycott or you know like as a protest like not to do anything but then it could be also you know like using this um opportunity for something else I mean to you know basically like make it better I think that's more constructive and I decided you know like I don't wanna spend energy in a way like for example my performance would be also about my identity and that's like you know I don't want this confrontation I don't want to like do something like that like something vulnerable in a space where I don't feel safe basically so oh of course yeah no I understand yeah but for example the nail salon would be like to create a space and like to feel safe for myself and for others yeah I think that would be perhaps you could do is like perhaps you can take I mean the nail salon from what I understand is by neutral so you can make something symbolic where in a way you address no maybe not directly but you can just through dramaturgy like just what you know like what impact they do like through narratives than just create a framework where basically not you but everybody who passes through speak out of what they think about the subject um and uh I think that will be constructive but I think that will be taking some position but also uh in a safe space and not also where you necessarily alone speak which I think is not so um I think it's better when when you hear different when I mean with the university can feel that there are different voices being affected right yeah and I think like there are like good initiatives happening at school it was very interesting seminar that is like basically it's like student organized student-run seminar so it's like official officially like happening uh like weekly with a space in the in on the campus but it's basically like I think there is a lecturer who's assigned to run the seminar because you know it has to be a seminar that you know you have to attend the students have to attend and the lecturer or Professor is there so but I think they try to like find someone who can give the space to the students so the students are self-organize and the good thing is that there is a budget for this so I mean not big budget but like people bring snacks and then they can get reimbursed for that yeah no that's good that's what people what people need people need to eat right totally like yeah I mean that's that's okay connected with you now the happy people need to eat exactly yeah so yeah I've been in touch with like people um in that seminar uh we could do something together or not but yeah um yeah that's that's where I'm at and I'm quite happy about where it's going I think sounds good no I'm just like I think where I just relax I think you know I I liked it yeah yesterday I talked with Anton okay for some specificities about Captree um this software we use on motion banks right um he was telling me then uh also about he's about to finish his Masters finally this is crazy because this guy didn't have his high school diploma right three years ago and now he's supposed to finish his Masters non-stop uh I don't know how to feel about it or said is that he was telling me that to be honest that he didn't really learn in his master or something new he's just fed up with this and he said I just want to get yeah he's just doing what he's requested from the bureaucracy of the University yeah but is that the hawk show in my mind or it's something yeah is about apology and system designer thing no stopology of information design I think okay um so I was asking him about his uh graduation project and it's quite interesting like I think perhaps that we could uh so basically what he's doing uh for for what I remember uh he's searching for um a case of views where he basically show uh that you don't need a lot of infrastructure or a lot of money to create uh telematics between uh via telematics so in his case what he's doing he's using um RTC web um to stream data packages of data and he was uh he will use uh sound location um so uh so it's quite abstract that what I understand is like and in both ends then you define uh some characteristic sounds for each of the performers so let's say there are two movers at the end of the uh of the pipeline and they would have say uh maybe a sine wave and the other one will have a square wave um and then from there so then you calibrate the you put like some initial States and then from there uh in a space using sonification um in 3D and it's kind of like beautiful sound um then the other person will have the location uh will understand what is the other person in relation to its body um does that make any sense so like what for example like if we are doing this like I hear you yeah in first like with my headsets basically yeah so first like you are you me so then we Define a initial State based on sounds and then from there we start moving uh and then basically we'll have feedback of each other and in relation to the space yeah but it doesn't mean like I if you're like virtually like moving from here to here then I hear sound from there yeah something like that yeah exactly yeah that's that's and if you move up here then I the hear the sound moving yeah that's like the the base the base ground of that yeah okay that's how yeah so that's some case of use um but of course like the uh we were talking that would be perfect like for instance for some some something like us like will be interesting uh with the because we have a case of use of telematics uh with those practices so and this is where this is something that is really applied with uh in virtual reality uh you really have the sound the sound really plays like that by default in a way um so I can imagine that so what we were talking with Anton fast was like um because he needs he will start deploying this I guess in August uh um and I need to start working on my thing of September so that's something that perhaps we can make it also work because he will need uh for his research he will need a yeah he will need some case of views where he can uh document the process yeah like a test bed kind of exactly so that would be interesting uh because he just basically gave us something ready to use and then we just uh yeah that could be interesting uh yeah also because I mean that's the that's the entry point but you can't send anything you know because this uh the system is robust because exists for some years already uh so you can basically send any kind of package I see so he was seen from the quality of movements movement qualities uh which those are very abstract uh then depends on what is that you define as effort or I don't know energy of uh and that would be interesting you know because those are things that you have to Define um yourselves you know you have to create like enter like a conceptual ground before implementing that and then implementing that and then trying and then so implementing in code and then deploying that and testing with the dancers so will be a very interesting process I see but I mean for a technical thing like is it tracking or is it like how does it work with this in a way like could be tracking could be tracking could be tracking then you can use different ways to track but could be tracking like one way of tracking is like using something that he was trying to explain to me we think uh yeah something for uh ROTC for sound that it uses the position that's tracking the position use a based on an initial stake in relation to the other endpoint and so but it's tracking it's right in an initial state yeah yeah so but then yeah of course you can then uh also start using uh you're gonna start tracking different things uh and then just send uh yeah yeah it is very abstract of course like uh but it seems like could be something that I can see us applying especially because I have this in my head at some point we should try to do a practice to do some maybe kind of a residence uh on virtual reality because this is really this is really made somehow uh for like a gear like Oculus Quest 2 has this thing already embedded um so I can see that perhaps we can at some point do a residence where we explore this for a week or two weeks and it could be interesting um also towards the performance perhaps you know I mean in terms of like this in a way It produced something that in a way is kind of tangible or I will say like appealing anesthetically appealing and not so complicated from the from the audience perspective say for instance what you and me do often is very glitchy right so um in that sense uh uh this could be interesting towards a performance that we can do in telematics one performance that use this technology specifically right yeah that makes sense I mean an Anthem will be interested but what I'm saying is the answer Anthem will be interested in in finding people to do this uh but also he doesn't have to that's what he was telling me that the originally he was trying to do that but then he realized also for his project and time he said I know and I'm gonna do that but then I said like perhaps that's something that we can make it work within the consistence you know like within the academy the motion bank or Schuler and make it work in terms of resources time space yeah yeah yeah I mean I just started think I mean just saying this loud aloud but um this could be interesting Direction I don't know how many if there's like anyone interested in like providing service like this but we could just you know write to companies doing whatever telematic stuff related stuff and just you know it's just say that you know we have this use case so we can use your service if you want to like you know um test it or if you want something in your portfolio I didn't get it I didn't get it so this time like Anton would be like you know basically he has kind of a product that she wants to test yes and I don't know if there's like if there are companies who's doing more like experimental stuff not just like video conference and if they need to you know yeah somehow like find out like use case but I don't know I'm just like trying to think you know Maybe it's hard to get money from this but if there's like a company who's interested in like collaborating basically but like tools like totally like we could be professional dummy bodies exactly I don't know like how to frame it but it might be like a niche you know it makes sense you need people I mean you cannot just only do it with answers you need people who has this thresh full of yeah they need to know how to implement these things right right yeah that's that should be uh we couldn't even just I mean I'm sure like Anton has to do and study part of his because he's basically his proposal as I said is towards open source and to show that you don't need these big things and so he needs to do a study of the market and that could be interesting because then we just jump on that like oh what are those numbers what is what is what is the what is the whole in the market field what is opportunity um yeah I just remember like when I was part of this project but it's like hard to explain they basically wanted to do like it's like a musical piece with like 100 members from like different choirs and then they wanted to do like virtual rehearsals because during covid and then I think they got access to um how do you call it it's like this like work Adventure or um you know the studio environment like Mozilla hubs kind of stuff but 2D okay yeah yeah and then but that's that service is like like you said you know they have they're like specialized in like audio specialization so you can hear like basically they render the sound so that you can hear from where others are in the virtual space so that would have been like good use case for this um practicing with you know different members from the choirs but then again like audio uh latency and stuff comes in so in the end I don't think we did anything but I think we got access to this service anyways because you know it's like art project itself you know like commercial project that we were doing right so I'm pretty sure like you know if there's anything interesting like we could contact and they might give us access um but I I would be just if they can pay us for something but I don't know if that's like there's like uh that much like investment to what we do but but this will be this is interesting like to I mean to enter in this domain as exploration because we need to find ways to make sustainable what we do uh so then I just I was thinking like that at the beginning when I was doing when I entered a Joss project uh I was taking that wall of project management and since the project was very much at the threshold of product design especially back then we didn't know uh if to make a product out of it or not and I was taking more the role of like uh yeah trying to create to find a niche and doing all the market research and I was taking the product management of the of of the of that was my role and then we pitched that project given to One bank I remember as part of this hobby oh yeah remember he said that yeah so like and I'm just like mentioning this because it was very interesting to see like the reactions of people I don't know with George what was his thought my thought was really to get actually the resources from that um but then I'm thinking that this the reason you're mentioning like I I really see like a case of views for a niche market that actually now should be moving since the Technologies are moving so fast um where you if you need people like dancers with technology with technical uh knowledge to test your products uh that's a very Niche that's a niche that's a niche group um especially if you want to do it let's say in some kind of low budget you know like because otherwise you have to hire the technician and also the dancer and that's what and and a whole crew uh which makes the thing yeah more expensive at the end so I'm thinking that that could be I mean that I see without knowing too much that the fact that you and me can do uh play both roles they create dancer Creator and the technician Technologies um give us this niche um um then also underlining you know like your uh uh but then in a way like what we did with the the application with Molina that you are the technical guy that I'm the artist guy in a way um so this is one thing but then the other thing is that well so the other thing will be to check around because like then it's I mean to check to see what is happening with these things like uh there should be a lot of things appearing right now especially with artificial intelligence things like they're just like bumping every day and um it would be interesting to see um even I mean we can talk this after uh especially maybe not on a public video but which company sucks you know of you know like said like this is something that we have to do for a while but be but I also put kind of like Benchmark that's the way how normally you're doing this uh when you do Market study stuff like you try to do a benchmark or like you try I mean it's not something that I see myself doing for five years you know it's not something that I'm interesting to do for the rest of my life so it could be something that we have to Define okay maybe we want to do this for a year and then spend some time doing this uh and Define and also the roles what are you doing what I'm doing um so this is something that perhaps could be interesting to explore uh and to document also because we are at that threshold of the artist and design in terms of products like artists and design product client products uh so as even as I just as a research will be interesting for uh documentation like and write something uh it has an academic branch that I'm seeing there like um that is something that I think that I'm interested to start like developing to start writing to start like sharing the content to start hearing voices and critiques about what we do so to open the dialogue for other people to get more involved also and this could be one case of use you know like so the market the artist designer going for clients right yeah I mean like you said like if we do like markets research yeah we might find like interest from something we don't expect like I remember when I was working for a professor in Toronto like we had a project um that was like partially funded by like mobile company like they have like basically they try to make like a Fab Lab kind of space but they just don't know what to do with this budget and space so they're just like you know well in the end like what we didn't really use their equipment except the laptop which is a bit sad but I think there was also money involved and um yeah I mean it's a nice way to make it you know product big companies to to have something that well not just like investment to Art in art but something you know state of the Arts basically yeah and especially because it really checked the boxes you know like so I mean from the company side and you they are investing in art but also from the uh also you can see it from academic point of view there is a re research in that threshold of Art and Design which is something that's origin in Belgium which is really rigid with this way so we apply and so on um they change the laws here I think two years ago and in a way so say before you have a really clear the differentiation and also payments and taxes on the artists and the technicians and now um there is not such a um and in a way so the technicians who are let's say so the technician now is being seen close to the design work uh in paperwork the yeah you know it is a big picture of so this is this is something that the in Belgium they're invested like in the place where I was studying for instance like when I entered to study there the program at the second year of a study you were supposed to take uh a profoundization or in art and technology or in development because what I studied was web development basically [Music] um but uh and Peter is there from seeds he was a teacher of Art and Technology um when I moved so when yeah when I was in in the moment to select already the program changed because the policies change also and this on the final role of the whole school who is also trying to give some art was removed from there so now the hostfully cannot provide art art you have to go and see it in the University um yeah and and and now they in my University you can select clearly uh somehow like pronunciation in a way but in my portfolio my focus was the narrative motion design with focusing in gotta remember but it was a narrative motion design that's the profanization which give give you some classes in such a signer and BJ and stuff like motion Design After Effects and so on um but then you can also go BR and so on but so these are just classes who are technical classes they don't speak about art anymore right yeah yeah so I mean I was mentioning all of these in regard to what we're speaking because is something that is new like this threshold of the artist designer which classically has been a part uh when you start working with technology and art is using technology um it's a topic that has to be this it still must be developed from the academy so where their research made on those top topics which means that the research often needs to go to hand in hand with clients as designer client um yeah I mentioned in this because that will be your case like you have a client and then you know what that your artist but also your designer I see yeah yeah true but that's something because I mean but then again like it becomes like you know different hat kind of uh example and basically like on one hand like me try to like you know sell the the product or the service the service appeals appeals to them but on the other hand like we want to keep it so that the key for example in our case is a practice so it's not like you know it's not making for the market something making you know I mean we have to like format it to sell but the core of the practice shouldn't change right or like you know we have to use that opportunity to do something good for us that benefits us yeah yeah because I mean the practice like and that's I think that's why I think it's very useful but we already started developing this language when we said like there is this sandbox so this sandbox it should be there I was thinking we should do this one of these things soon so so this is something that is there and it uh is and and it serves as a sandbox [Music] it's a virtual machine somehow um we can test also things there but then because we know the how it works then we can take different roles or hats and then try to go in certain places and the thing is in a way now to the we don't stay classically normally in design in a way you know I mean I'm speaking like big terms not like so barely like classically in a way like they are like to the artist is not so much push what he wants to do because in terms of it like it's just something that is defined through heuristics or this process on the going finding meaning of what you're doing while in the design processes uh is more linear like before you start doing a chair you know how the chair will look like sorry you know how the chair will be functioning the art of is not functional it might be functional but it's not a requirement from the beginning because the artist doesn't have to that's not the role of the classically of the artists then with the design classically speaking again uh you have this understanding of what is a chair let's say the example of a chair you can be artistic as you want with your chair depending on what the client wants but the chair nevertheless must be a chair and a person needs to be able to sit on the chair right um this so this is classical I'm saying I'm just trying to to go to a point um now the ace license these things are very cross especially this is the case of us is really cross uh it's entangled in this complexity perhaps we don't really need to Define what is the function of the chair uh although we know it's a chair so we can know is that it's an abstraction of a chair there is a function there but maybe it doesn't have to be so robust maybe the chair it can be a chair that the client knows the chair might break after a while because our purpose is with the chair to use it as an interface for something to happen that allow the client also to explore other mediums um so what I'm saying is we don't necessarily need to know because I mean I'm saying that you start going in in in what it is that we should do but normally is that what you do what you have a client like uh that that's perhaps the place where because we are at the intersection maybe make not too much sense to start going to the classical design way but just underlying that we don't know which is more close to the artist so if it's not completely this we don't know as an artist but also is not completely we know but it's gonna be a chair but it's something in between that you put in The Proposal uh and then they understand that you are neither a classical artist neither a designer but a hybrid mix of both okay but that's our perspective right because as a client I think they well I don't know if they want something concrete or like the functionality", "rZtg8vQRy2s": "okay hello everyone do I hear you or I'm not hearing you there's something strange no but my audio is moving [Laughter] okay here's the practice okay yeah that is fine hello a long time no see exactly it feels so long it's how we talk about Bruno it's very important on the meeting with Bruno okay so there are some topics to talk one will be new now the other one would be uh the Guggenheim Museum maybe we can start from maybe yeah maybe I'll start like from the Googling hand we'll start saying so um the so I was in millbao um arrived two days ago and I remember things I knew that I was going to Bilbao then I asked to friends so around like hey what is there in Bilbao or something and everybody was mentioned in the Guggenheim Museum and I thought okay it's a museum but then I go and I experience this thing and that was very unique like now I understand why everybody was mentioning so much the museum um so I think what is important to to mention is is that the what it makes very interesting the experience of the museum is that is not about the artworks what is about the people so for instance like their collection their private collection I don't think has more than 20 artworks exhibit in a massive Square I think I don't know is this the museum is huge um but there's no more than 20 artworks to see okay so that's incredible because then the way who is the the curatorial process that it goes is incredible like the the whole experience that starts from is part of the is a landmark on the of the city you can access from different places so from outside already is part of the experience uh and then you go inside and the way home is how you navigate the museum the whole way or the user experience happens um it's just it really takes into account the visitor so it's not too much about putting a lot of artworks they might be relevant um but it's about giving offering a good experience for uh Grand public that they will call in French like a mainstream public and I was mentioning this and I have to think on on the topic of the workshop the the last uh chat we have here when I mentioned that we have this video that I don't know if you had the time to revisit when we have this chat with Annie uh so then at some point Annie was making the phone she was a that in what she's doing nowadays that involves often telematics then so people from different places communicating through a system like Zoom um then what you were saying was something like that it would work no matter what you propose if the people feel that you are giving their space and that was very really the it stays on my head like if the people feel that they are important she was using those words if the people feel that they are important they will give you the attention you you want no matter what you're proposing in terms of content in terms of the structure also it will be fine if the people feel that they are important that you take them into account so where you take the position of being the object of attention which traditionally is like Italian art but then you just twist it and you're you reverse it towards the audience then the audience is important without the need to putting them on the spot because that's a different thing and I think that's uh what I wanted to share and I connect this with the Google hand was very much like that but like how do they make that like in the cooking home I mean one is like I think it's um because there is not too much to see basically so if you if I just compare to my experience going to a museum then depending on the museum you know that you should be ready to be tired at some point before you start especially when they are renewing uh the thing in Louisville or like something that extreme so you know there will be long so you're preparing mentally to be tired by the artworks right before you go there and in this case already I was with that I was thinking like he's gonna be tired but it's such a pleasure because there's just no more than 20 things to see foreign could be more or even less I don't know but there are just few Arbors in in a huge Museum so but does it mean like there's like empty space or like no no no no no no no yeah there is a I think it's a combination so there's a lot of architecture so there's a lot of movement proposed by that the architecture itself that is uh impressive but also the artworks often are just huge it's just one room okay so it's very much about experiencing the artwork which is something that you know when you go and see fireworks also normally that's in a way is intrinsic that you go and you take the time to experience the artwork because they are especially when their masterpieces and all these things they I mean art is not about to solo to solve a problem in a way that's more like is always coming from an experience of a person in the art so it often requires that you slow down and experience try through your sense what is that resonates to you yeah but if you have 300 words to watch in two hours you cannot do that right yeah yeah I'm trying to think like I mean I can just like search for images and how it looks like but this is funny because to me like you know the way you say it sounds like in in a way they're like really generous about like accommodating the artworks which makes sense like what you said makes sense you know like people can take time and yeah time as well because if it's not like you know things to see and you have to like go back and forth between the artwork and the those labels because if there's like a lot of works then I feel like you're just like reading those labels all the time um so like in that sense it makes sense but at the same time like I could also Imagine something like a loop where you know this Mona Lisa have has this like you know period pretentious frame and like guards I don't know if they're like if that room is dedicated for Mona Lisa or like there are other artworks but you know like the artworks just stands out too much that you know I don't know how to say it but it's kind of opposite from like you're you're like highlighting the audience yeah yeah it's just like my interpretation nobody makes it makes sense because in a way it's like in in Louisville it's almost like they it's just the institution as it really works this analogy of being the police just being afraid that the stupid non-art is peasants will just destroy the Masterpiece so off pay the thing watch take the selfie and move on yeah yeah which is very much I mean that I mean that's the system now does this is the I mean that's the neoliberal system is this is that's what the proposes it proposes the most efficient way to generate Revenue yeah sure and just out of curiosity like how long did you spend in that museum I guess we arrive around and we stayed until always had four wow because it gives you it gives you that possibility so there is you go watch you go out also that's really cool I I don't remember in other museums that but I'm sure it should happen but you can leave the museum and come back they give you a bracelet so you can just go have a tapas whatever it is there is food you come back in your time and it's great I see yeah I like actually I this is something I never said in the chat but because we don't talk about museums but I like to like visit museums like say museums same Museum again and again just you know just have like not not you know to see different exhibitions but like particularly like just visit same exhibition again and again especially like when I have like access with my student card or something um just you know it you start to like how do you say not inhabit this thing but yeah it feels like you inhabiting the space in that sense like you know you remember like different Corners that stands out or like or yeah you know like once you can just like just walk through and then not to pay attention to artwork that also I like to do especially like like lootfish in Cologne we visited together right uh the big one yeah I I visited there like solving times because it's free for a student having art students so I really like it it's just like it's just so big that you can just walk around and every time I feel like a different experience especially compared to like looking at each artwork and paying attention and there's nowhere else that you can have this kind of like I mean it it feels a bit like you know walking in a forest because you can pay attention to like you know each detail but you can also like to sewn being filmed out and just like walk through right yeah I got it yeah let's talk about then what about new now then why am I laughing is this public video yes I have to choose words uh no I really that sounds really bad but no I I really I mean it was a positive experience for sure and I appreciate that I was somehow uh treated as a guest I was very surprised because uh Yasmine she's the director of the festival and we didn't really meet her in the last one I just saw her she's part of some network of something that I started doing now yeah yeah she was a director I just right now yeah when we presenting you now I didn't you no it was yeah we didn't have time to talk and but she recognized me recognized me that we presented last time so that was nice and that gave me access to like several Private Tours and stuff and um what else so the festival is it's about Digital Arts I actually didn't know that they have it they on the poster they like it's a Digital Arts Festival and this time they had the first day was the opening and performances and like last time but then the second day they had the conference like the whole day was the conference of Symposium and they did it in a separate space which was like I think it was a good idea because yeah horrible most horrible experience yeah and you always have to go up all the way to go to the conference sure and but in other space was like in Sovereign or somewhere else within yeah in the in Solstice it's like I don't know five to ten minute walk from the exhibition space yeah it really feels like I don't really have sense of time in that space I can't really say but maybe it's close to 10 minutes it's more like a storage like big space and they set up a set for the conference and but it was like like full day like starting from 10 to like 10 in the evening oh wow this is fully packed schedule and I was there only for like yeah like first couple you know like I don't know I saw like two or three talks in the morning and then I checked another like two talks in the afternoon because there was also like other activities happening and that was really like disorienting like I mean like last time nobody knows like what is happening there's no program I mean there is but there isn't so I felt like it was really hard to like navigate if you're not like friends with them if you just like visit the stage without knowing anything it's really hard I mean you can still find the exhibition but um yeah and this time it the topic of the expression that the conference was like hyper nature so it's like a nature but you know like more like speculative approach to it and and they emphasized a lot that the exhibition is like commissioned like it's like new works that they exhibit so the artists have to like come up with something new and new now um to have something site-specific basically yeah especially in that mixing plant yeah yeah and so I but I talked with like a few artists there and uh jinxia she's from I mean she's from Italy that she's based in Montreal and we know each other from Montreal so we were hanging out and her work the works I know from her is basically like with projection or like display and kind of she has like minimalistic geometric approach like lines and you know circles and very like how to say I I wouldn't say Zen but something very like simple and meditative works but this time what she did is she made like a garden with in the The Mixing plant you know this this the floor that is completely dark yeah she made it like a she put soil and the plants and in the middle there is like a Pond like little Pond and and the huge display standing in front of well the back of the pond but on the screen you don't see anything but if you look into the pond you see the sun as a reflection of the display so basically what she did is like she took out the polarizing filter on the screen so whatever it's shown on the screen it's just like pitch quite so it's like it's like display that has like nothing on it but because of blue and because yeah like because the water acts as a polarizing filter so the reflection you can see the image found very interesting like I think for her it was like probably like the biggest project that she she has done and also like involving um Architects no not Architects like uh Engineers like how do you say it like civil engineer obviously like like yeah yeah basically like here like working with this like plans and you know like yeah like plan for this whole set and yeah it was it was very beautiful um like has like her Aesthetics but also like um I would say like step up but they yeah like this big scale like using the space although yeah she was very exhausted after setting this all uh setting up this whole thing um which yeah I find it's nice like you know new now Festival providing this kind of opportunity for artists to work on something that's like a good side yeah so but do you know like about the production budget and these things I have no idea but like they had like I don't know like six seven months to prepare or something like that budget wise I don't know six seven months to prepare yeah no I don't think so I think they open I know it could be true yeah it could be that the open call was in general yeah that's a tricky thing like I know that because when I saw yeah I mean this is okay I have to find the right words when I saw the open call I already knew that uh Tunisia was like [Music] um like the festival contacted her like last summer she was only already telling me that she's going to be in Germany so when I saw the open call I was like I don't know if you know what scale this is about you know like because it's not going to be in the main exhibition for sure because I I know that some artists are already you know starting to work on the their works right like last year like last time with chips and chips the kitchen chips yeah yeah this is like something I found yeah like yeah questionable that for example that's one thing and also like the festival is basically saying that they have I don't know like 60 events 60 or 70 events over like two months of the festival which I feel like it's a little bit like a bit weird yes because the festival is basically like three days like this opening conference and the third days like Workshop but it's more like targeted to like people directing or organizing festivals for example John was there to to visit that Workshop it's about like future of festivals or something so it's very like targeted audience I mean basically if new now invited like Festival directors for example like yard from fiber he was there too fiber in Amsterdam yeah and you know some people from new tech Montreal music Mexico um so that was like pretty targeted audience I mean I think the whole festival was like like that it's it's very like specific crowd that you know obviously they are like funders like like you know connected this politics and I didn't really see much like friends like from the region like they said I was there but she was you know um part of the last Festival she was not part of this this Edition she told me um she was visiting the festival but other than that uh like Viviana was there because she's working for the festival yeah yeah she was she was uh curating some programs so she was there but like outside the team I don't think I met anyone from the region no that's you know something to think about I think yeah I mean probably there are some you know artists also like there are some schools in eastern so people from there is it too but yeah the audience wise I feel it's more like people invited from elsewhere to visit the festival that was my impression I'm not saying I know everyone it makes sense yeah but I mean this is part of the problems I found like in my time working with these mediums that and I was in Germany that um that's one of the problems that Germany has I mean that's one of the virtues problems that Germany has and in terms of impact because they don't have because they work by federations so I just her region they they do efforts and things the resources are not on Limitless they start working really on the regions so say let's put it like more what I'm trying to say is is very difficult in general to create networks within digital art because it still is not being seen as something I think I think we are in a process like historically speaking like what uh video or passed in the 70s where they fought I don't know if you know that part of history but like they fought really strongly for a while for quite some years I don't I don't know for how long but it was for many years that there was things going on uh starting from the Japan but there and look shoes but there was a lot going on and it took them a while for art so from Fine Arts to accept them as art so if you are it fought really hard their space and now they are something that is not fine arts is video art which is a subcategory everything film experimental films video Arts so I'm my appreciation like from them historically speaking I think I think we are in kind of a similar period where our our art and technology which is something that is not new I mean that's the weird thing because if you really feel if you if you try to be more specific like say you go to the context of dancing technology it's something that is not new it has a big high in 2010 around that period and you can see the numbers and it just chills at some point you just uh until Kobe and now it's just ramping up really fast but the weird thing is people are not really checking I mean we're still are in the times where we speak about this subject as something new when you read the papers and you people will always reference or something new but this is so this is not something new first and second is they because this is something not new there there's a lot of uh research and things done in the past on this field so these are resources that are not being used partially because of their typing uh uh methods and the access to that specific information that one can argue that's one point but it's not only that it's just that people have no that we don't really care and just try to start doing new stuff and those new stuff and let's make new stuff and new stuff but there's a lot that has been done very interesting things you know you have Martini you have a lot of people who are really like at this point like they are Masters in their field like we are start working on this but there are people who now they have a very clear voice about their work and we don't mention them foreign yeah I mean so why is it oh yeah like this regional thing and yeah is that mean is the I guess what I was trying to to say with this is like in Germany you have a great access to resources to create digital artworks that we lack at this point in Belgium um so there is a possibility to create like short-term proposals only constantly constantly but they're going somehow nowhere there is not really a vision in terms of where Earth is going right I say yeah it makes sense yeah I mean that can be also like yeah like what exactly applies to new now like it's it's something significant in some ways and but then if it's just happening there without like involving the local community for example then you know it's just like same guys knowing this thing like people from node well I'm also I was really funny like I'm always introducing to people like myself I'm representative of note um which is actually true now and but yeah like what I want to say is like you know this new tech node uh who else was there but basically these like same people are always there and not really like it's it's just like um uh club or you know yeah yeah no that's that's I think this is the right word it's kind of like a and this is something that that's that's path you know that's that's exactly what happens in puff but already they're and if you see like in my portfolio when you click in buff that was the first thing that I that Janet wrote so there is at some point where in the the the Jan addresses the fact that it's a place for white elite and he said it's not in purpose it just happened so but the focus is on work but he addresses back then that he can see the people who go there often are this is an elite place to go but becomes a club where you go and meet your friends in the countryside house basically to talk about the interesting things the after will affect different people but the different people have know what to say on this because they are not part of the network um and it's not bringing back the conversation to to Art to let's say to you now as an example it's not that there is all artists because because like there's a lot of people I'm pretty sure they're doing cool stuff around the region and so I think the problem is in uh the convergence or like the cross point between return of investment that's one that's why yeah so return of investment and curatorial processes because the festival needs to return investment they need the investor needs to feel that something happened and then you make that tangible through selling tickets or maybe through selling in saying in the website and you did 60 events who is going to check you see what I mean so like but this part of like returns of investment like the investors which is in this case I don't know like it will be partly I guess a big part of the money should come through the tax payers of Essen of I mean of the region uh so it's people who they don't they're not gonna check you know like detail by detail how the money was spent but just they need to see that there's a return of investment so perhaps they just check the website oh wow yeah six year ends wow two months run okay the money was invested and so is so I understand that that needs to happen but then it's more I think it's about and it's low in the process and then taking more into account what are the decisions for to address uh the return of investment uh so then the processes are not happening so fast [Music] um yeah people yeah and also like for example they don't know if it's going to happen again you know it's like they frame it as biannual but like I mean every two years but then the next one it depends if they get money or not right that's crazy I mean that make no I mean like in a Belgium Panorama like when I was like checking out with the kunson festival that's how by the way like this is like to hands up to Daniel the Queenstown Festival Lazar I was checking a bit of the history and I just wrote like I was writing some personal emails to him like this is something that is it's creating the sense of wait because I'm trying to mix two things so is that in Belgium we don't have this small like these things like that are not happening like we don't have this like that's why art and Technology can say so new is not really pastoral filters of Science and I don't know who they do these things but it's not it's not really happening here also the fact that dance is so prominent in Belgium is not helping dance and Technology to move because you have massive dance companies who always take the same resources um um but for instance I think a question Festival is a good example let me let me stay here I mean so I'm living in Belgium since 2010 I moved here as a dancer right and then while I was dancing actively I heard of the constant Festival that's ours I check it fast but it was something that I never really killed like called my attention it was something that was not attractive to me like in different ways I don't know and like the Daniel Daniel together would people take the the start directing the Christian Festival around three years four years ago and the process that has been taken until now as you see one piece this Festival but I follow up through social media and check what is happening it's incredible like this is really addressing it's almost like the festival is addressed to non-white people it's incredible like it's not the white people cannot attend that it's not about that but it's clearly there's really often things for bipok communities there's a lot going on with the local the local uh areas where the or the venues where the things happening so you have the return of investment because you have like this massive company name still passing which often is still passed through the curatorial decisions who are still in line with the main politics that I guess and somehow is addressing this change of perspective to give space to not only why but just move a bit more Spectrum and it's moved drastically from the moment that the Stars like this year you see like wow but anyway so again so you have return of investment because still you bring big companies uh you do the traditional thing of the festival there is well known worldwide I guess partly if this is like John end up here um um so you have this thing that it was what everybody I guess worldwide in in Performing Arts they knew about Constance Festival that it was not interested to me um but then also then since you have the system working then you hack the system in a amazing basically you start just hacking the system in a in a with care it's not so it's not breaking uh what's the name of this the non-hacking but it was a name when you a name for you have hacking and break bracking I think it's breaking cracking yeah so it's not about breaking the system but it's about the hacking the system so just with usually we use the framework to allow for other resources to move on allow people who not have the same advantages in terms of uh privilege to be benefit of what the framework has to offer and I'm connecting this I guess with this like what I'm saying with a uh that's I mean what I'm trying to do is that it's quite complicated I don't know if if I make sense of what I'm saying because I'm connected with you now in the sense of new now is about let me try to what I'm saying is like institutions are bubbles within bubbles you know like you have the you have in Germany you have the MW and Brian RW um no well North Rhine West fire yeah so in nrw have Germany above all inside of Germany you have the regions and inside inside until you have to new now which is a bubble still uh but that bubble might explode now because the bubble minor get money to the next year so there is nothing it cannot do this because if the idea is that the Bubble Shoot touch the person who is living in Germany you need to reach all the way up so the bubble needs to be continuous like the fact and connected this with the constant Festival Daniel could not have done this from the first year is something that he's been doing systematically slowly until this year I was surprised I was like wow man you just read and name after name I just known white artist and he's not xenophobic it's like it's not like it's it's just response to a clear line in the politics that is stretched to a future it reaches the the person who lives in Brussels so it reached all the way to the governmental from the bubble all the way reaches out and that that demands continuity which means money right interesting yeah I mean notice that like along that line too I mean in a way that it's not like they changed something from the beginning but also it's you know like balancing this DVD community and what for example John wants to qh and that's being like always like you know something tricky I'm not going to no that's cheats right  Duty okay that's what you need like that's part of the resource that's open source open source create ethics and things yeah okay jumping in the jumping in what you're saying with no yeah yeah I think is it relevant for the people who are following right so like basically it's like you know they have two different interests basically like one is this vbv community that is very specific specific tool um and now they're like moved to node Institute to basically like physically based in Berlin it's like a studio um yeah but basically it's one thing that is really really which they're interested in you know like making tools for the create something that's DVD and then on the other hand for example like no 20 there was uh well the online exhibition and the the conference which um oh by the way Alex was there to uh at you now he was selling the selling books poor Alex he had to like sit uh next to the conference all day looking after the books but the books of like notes or the books of what are new now like well I don't exactly know where it's from but uh for example like he had the hollow magazine yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so yeah like Alex and John was you know they were curating the the program for the conference at node and that's like completely separate from dignity right I mean there was like a few programs that was about like sharing Community um Works around vvd but basically it's more about um academic theoretical topics around digital art so but then you know like it's that's like interesting like tension not attention but you know like what they like how they work together and how to um how to say contribute to each other basically because it is one Festival like like together as a program they have like workshops and DVD workshops and then on the other hand they have a conference and then they have to somehow like you know not taking advantage but like benefit each other which I think like making an annotation in this like I think in the case of node is particularly difficult because the community of node often is made by developers so not artists who are interested in sales and contextual work but some of them are developers who just like to deploy things so that means yeah yeah the B4 Community yeah [Music] right yeah I'm really curious like for example I'd note like how many people were like interested in taking workshops and then they discover the conference or like vice versa like interested in a conference and then they discovered BBV and started using it or taking workshops I don't know how this kind of like cross-section happens yeah well I I just deferred through the conference I try to use the software and I say off I'll use those designers like nothing I use low level Computing off yeah but I mean yeah okay okay no but I I feel like it's um like somehow related to this this topic that you said about Daniel's Festival because you know basically you have to use the resource somehow it can be the resource from the past festivals and then they you know try to well change something within a festival or like working with other departments in the festival and somehow create a Synergy so that it benefits to your the program you want to curate right yeah but I mean I I also think there's something that we haven't spoke here we haven't addressed directly but it is within the lines of what we are speaking is that if you're working with technology you need to be conscious of the impact that you're having on the milieu so meaning that one of the best practices in a way of working with Technologies to reuse material you need to restart like not only for you I mean it's just this is a fact I will even argue is a fact responding to the crisis that we are living so it will be responsible if you start just start keeping on I don't know say like do the laser Moon without being ecologically for instance you know like start I mean this is something that artist has to be more confronted and if art is more also the institutions and so on and to promote this kind of best practices um so reusing reusing but we're using I mean to not use like to upcycle upcycling yeah yeah this is like something I was questioning like when they said funny for you now they every artist created new work and I mean obviously like it's not something they started creating something from scratch of course they come from you know their practice and they perhaps you know reuse material or upcycle whatever they have um pretty sure but then is that a good thing or not I mean to have everything new I mean I I have like I like some I mean something I want to say conceptually but yeah no no but I absolutely I will jump on on that point and if you don't take the I like to be compromised with this like I then I will set them perhaps is I mean responding to this ecological crisis then the new then is not helping because I guess but we need to I mean if they're trying to address the is the new as you know understanding a new new understanding of the world the budding of the world um I guess that's what they want with the name but I guess we think the community within the creators the new is not helping because I think we have to understand not it's not about understanding understanding conceptually like it's not about one time this course is something that we need to embody it like we need to really embody that we have to upcycle resources especially when we work with electricity yeah yeah actually like so I talked about this uh Genesis work with the plants and um her partner was also there Luca uh we're also friends I mean I don't look up more and at one point he was like making this kind of joke that um so basically the festival is responsible for you know watering and putting lights when they're closed so that the plants are alike but then if they you know forgot to do it or if it was not enough and plans start to die then you know that also like reflects the festival because we work often with plants the project we did in Bruce that was a huge part like who is going to take care of the because we have different there were not few there were a lot of plants in this massive installation and they were not so there were clusters of one pot a small pot like I don't know it could be more than 50 plants um and I think Sid has been working on bio modes that is specifically Ops like crazy symbiosis between uh E-Waste and plants um I think the project is running for more than 10 years so we have already the uh leverage on these things but we still haven't found a way to solve that problem because it always happens that the plans I mean we always have a stock of these plans who we know they work for what we need so it's ethically really questionable because what the whole pitch about is is about recycling upcycling and so on symbiosis with technology but then when you really go I mean that's what they are public sees now like oh wow this is so ecological um so one when you really go in depth of how these things that I'm sure is happening in other festivals like in you now with this work then just it's very dirty the way of all things still run the public doesn't know but often it's just very not ethical in a way following those lines yeah I mean ethical or not I mean anyways it's like this kind of Festival is creating something you know it's not it's not something that happens in the daily life that you know then it needs any any aspect of it needs care you know because a lot of people Gathering some artworks are there and that's something that yeah they have to put extra effort to to accommodate them I mean you know like preparing food for example that was also like something um stupid that yeah I don't want to go to detail but basically there was not like there was not dinner served or even like sold so and the second day there was no food there was lunch there was soup for lunch but I think there was no dinner and then like I actually on the second day I went to pack something like to see a show which was not part of new now at all uh it's just like different program but I wanted to see this from Michelle twinsky and that's something other topic that there was a lot to talk about this performance but basically after the show people from new I mean some curators uh not working for you now like invited by new now and they were looking for food and they ended up at sulfurline because there is a bar where they sell food they came after the show see yeah but yeah this is but this is this is part of like this is this is I mean it's funny but this is part of actually the the care this is part of this low process and thinking on yeah not yeah like to to move the perspective of the yeah just to slow down and care of what is happening not only in deploying which is the problem of having short-term Solutions in short-term Solutions you need to prove return of investment and that's not serving food to people um right yeah true that's interesting I mean especially in Solberg like you don't I mean you're in the middle of nowhere you can I mean if you have a conference from 10 in the morning till 10 pm and you expect say in order for like like the conference has a very is a very is the most interesting things from these festivals I have been following conference non-stop in April and is there where you hear like about these topics but we're trying to do here reflect on how to to to make it better somehow but then if you expect that I also if you invite people specific people to attend this and you want them to be part active part of the framework but you don't offer them food and you know the only way is if they go far away you and then the the the brakes are half an hour or 10 minutes five minutes in between it's not it's impossible and nobody cares about it it's like they will yeah and I always like I'm so so thankful for John when we were at node 20 like there was always food but there was no there was always food yeah no no no just tell you true yeah so I mean not I'm not comparing I mean I am comparing but that I mean those are questions right I mean also like yeah it's all parents really it's a tricky place like some people were staying at this Friends hotel but most of them are staying near the main station so they had to commute that's not bad that's not good like so they so but the people coming from Toronto I mean from from Montreal did I stayed in in Samurai snow I mean I think my guess is like because for example she was there for like a week to set up to the stuff so she was put into this uh hotel and like like next to main station or close to main station and Miriam and yansu were staying at the Friends hotel because they were just there for a performance for one night so what is your assumption on this so maybe like if you're staying for like a week or like a couple days then you have to stay at the city in the city and then if you're staying for like one or two nights then maybe you can get Friends hotel like that's just like my observation but it's really good like if you compare for instance two years ago when we were staying at the Friends hotel then Priscilla for instance and other people who were working there for a month they were staying in that hotel with us ah right yeah so could be something in terms of budget but I didn't talk to everyone so I don't know how it was but yeah it's a very tricky place Thank you new now for the opportunity we really did or or talk was very interesting is there online I actually checked the Google Docs you know like you remember we share the Google Docs yeah during the talk and I don't know some people wrote something and I checked it like recently it was kind of funny it was not not much in it but I I like that there's like a trace like I don't remember what we talked but there is something from the talk but I think that that's one one strategy that I see it works when Frameworks are uh problematic by Nature say Arts and Sciences um they need so much resources in terms of time to make something uh lasting um if there is no resources like one of the things that work is classical documentation like ways that Trace what happened so videos like shared notepads anything that traces the activity it's really really important to analyze things you cannot stay two months in a symposium so anyways um but this time conference like so I I didn't check so much so I can't say much about it but it was really funny like there was like one TV next to the stage on the conference they were like showing you like AR ish you know like some kind of like Hydra kind of color filter of like life it's like live streaming of the stage but it's just next to the stage that is like like saturated imagine sometimes like 3D image comes in and I don't know who was doing like it's it's like Vivo kind of Aesthetics I don't know but um yeah that was I didn't really understand what it was and but it was kind of funny they did it because they're good and who was you was there doing that please comment in the but maybe hear the video and then maybe just yeah we close here video thank you so much for watching please like the video all right", "ik1jV4zEbwc": "okay hello everyone hello yes so to hoop what's happening oh nice soup is happening it's nice oh I bought this like have you seen these small printers what like wait I'm just gonna do this I do this yes no what would I do I switch like this I usually these things these small machines no are print are printers okay so they're pretty cool and what does it print let me just try to print you it's connected okay print again yes uh I cannot do it okay that's too much to ask uh it's a printer it's a printer I can it's a small printer and I just have a picture of Bowie ah nice next to a piece of meat there is this is half half of the size of Bowie but yesterday I I yesterday and you can see the quality of the first and the second nice is the size of what we was was more than 50 the size of Bowie more or less and boy was just looking at it I don't think her instincts were yeah it's just next to this like steak bloody and she's just looking at the smells and she just go like no that's not nice the funny thing is when you move the printer uh so it needs to be stable to print when you start moving it will Miss some of the lines so then you can glitch the image basically I see yeah so pretty cool I'm happy I bought it in of course bored in Ali yeah yeah so yes that's my that was my reward for being too nerdy I have been just working too much I guess on between reading and in writing a lot um but I'm happy with this exercise uh yeah very nice yep that's nice when you finish school you can do what you want I knew that I will do that like when I finished my studies like especially I mean I'm I'm coming through Humanity so I like to develop concert and that's something that I have to stop when I was studying technology practically so you you were so you are you happy there with the rupertal life with the pin about company you're becoming the far number one up in about [Laughter] watching at front row well not front row but oh wow the show was amazing yeah I don't know what is what show is but no once you start speaking about the wall I have seen this in history of dance in my school yeah I've seen this but I mean we just spoke of that like maybe 15 20 years ago when I studied that [Music] um but yeah I have not seen it so maybe you can tell us what was about a little bit who's been about yeah who has been about we can have the you know chat with Pina boss generated with AI oh yeah that we can do know the show so basically yesterday was like um kind of uh they call it dancers day so in the afternoon you take a workshop and then that's the place where so now they have two locations one is the theater pineapples theater and one is the uh I don't know what's the name of Center or something like more like Research Center and that's a new place and there we had the workshop with the dancers from the company it's basically like you know just warm up and then um then we practice a bit of like uh uh reporteries from the dancers and then in the end we try to sorry we try to do um kind of like um get accession um with others but we are like 50 people how many like around 50 people I think five zero five zero something like that maybe I don't know like but it's not like 20 people it's like 40. wow I'll do them at home and they did they manage to do a workshop with 50 people of movement yeah because basically they had oh I don't know maybe like 10 dancers now I'm curious like what the yeah so it we gather and then like there was like a stage from the the choreographer voice and then then we split into groups but you know and then like we're just like I don't know different groups they had different exercises but basically our group were like like super active we were just like running around and then like stretching and then running around again and it was just for like I think 45 minutes it was not that long but it was super exhausting and at the end like he was the dancer was like teaching us the choreography but basically that's part of the show that we watched later and in the middle of the performance it's like three hour performance including the break the transition and when they have the transition they started to do like um how to say it's it's a bit like dance battle you know like they are like two groups and one of and wait wait wait the theater piece or the workshop the other piece but I'm talking about the workshop because I mean the theater piece because um at one point they have this kind of like a battle like there's like two groups and then one person comes in and then like they start doing movements and then another person from another group comes in and then you know like and then the movement is actually coming from um like movements to like kill someone okay the gesture of like you know like just like punching into your eyes or like you know pulling out your tongue or something like that okay the quality of movement yeah yeah yeah it's it's very Dancy but also like the the idea is to kill the other person so that was so I think what happened like each dancer developed their own um kind of movement and the dancer he was who was leading our Workshop uh he's from Peru or something I think and then like he was describing like he's doing like this kind of gesture to kind of like you know make make them make the other person you know frightened and then like this kind of gesture to like Punch or like I don't know stab the other person but it's it was really interesting because if he didn't explain to us it doesn't look so much that it's like uh it's not it's not like a martial art the way he does on the stage is quite quite Dancy so it's nice to have like a glimpse of like the ideas behind the choreography right I got it no and I I don't know if I sent you the photo but yeah but that part was like it's also like really brilliant so that was just before the the break we had like one now like there was like one hour perform like first first half is like one hour and a half or something and then there's like a break for like 20 minutes because they have to change the stage that's it uh within the piece within the piece yes so we had a quite long break and the way they did is like wow this kind of this dance battle started to happen and then one dancer wait no the before the pause so okay like first half happens and then the kind of the climax of the first part is this this battle Yeah and then one dancer shows this panel that says it's positive like pause and he's like walking around but it's just like doesn't stop for like five minutes or ten minutes so people can either decide they just leave now because it's a pose or you can just keep watching this kind of like interlude so that this transition of the stage is already happening on the stage oh it's happening in front of you backstage you know like everything is happening the the technicians are already there but also the dancers are still like doing this battle okay and also this panel of like polls pauses like there so it's kind of like you know tricking with people you know it's it's pause but it's it's not I'm wondering and I doubt actually that originally the piece was like that I think that should be another adaptation of the repertoire no it would be nice if you can check about that from what is that piece and you can bring this information back to us right yeah it's just I'm just trying to imagine back in time in terms of history of dance that I mean in terms of the um yeah what do you what you're supposed to do in the in that framework of the um um yeah back in time you know like the audience on this stage are very well defined so you're opposed to the thing right so I'm wondering yeah that historical thing um yeah yeah interesting yeah I don't know like about the piece I don't know what uh what to say it's just real things like I told you this whoa uh like this concrete blocks there's like piled up it's like wall when it starts and it's just like smashes to the back of the the whole stage and that's that creates the space and that's the beginning that's the beginning it's the very beginning that's the one that's wonderful because I mean this goes back to this one we were speaking I think it is online but Jonathan Boro says like in terms of choreography like that's the handshake you know what's importantly what you expect from the beginning okay yeah I don't know what else to say but then the question will be since um since what you see at the beginning is such a blast yeah would would your expectations um where your expectations uh reach I mean meaning that if something like that spectacular happens um afterwards normally you are uh you will expect things at that level to happen not necessarily formally but in terms of engaging you um were you satisfied afterwards like or because that's a what I'm saying is like that's a way of composition you know like if you start composing like that could be also detrimental to the performance because then if you if you if the performance after that is not going there then just you lose interest as an audience um how was your experience I guess that's the question yeah yeah like to me like this this whole mashing wall like I just it's like surprised because it's a sound but also like you don't really understand what happens what happened this is also real like even like when the the wall is there like when the curtain opens up and then the wall is there it you don't still don't know what it is and then it's just like smashes and then like then you understand what like after like a few moments you understand and then the piece starts so so they keep you so they kept you in suspense for a couple of minutes without understanding what was going on well not a couple of minutes but then I mean like it takes time to understand like but a few seconds you know like because after it's smashed then you see this whole scattered you know like blocks and also like this it's so like how they say um like it really like talks to senses because after like a couple minutes you start to smell this um particles in the air the Dust and also at one point in the show like this guy started to like pretend he's like cutting his arm but it is like obviously there is like a like a piece of meat and he cuts the meat and he puts on the the iron you know like for the for the clothes so it hits he heated so he cooks some meat and he eats it I was also like so then you smell the meat exactly like it doesn't come like immediately but this is something I found interesting like there's so many like small things like for example this part looks like comical and like people laugh about it when this happens or like I don't know um I um this is like a thousand things happening but for example like one dancer is like just staying still and then another um dancer from the back just lifts and they turns 360 degrees and then jumps I know that it comes back and then next time the the dancer who was lifted is holding a glass and someone pours like water or wine or whatever in the glass and the dancer is like stay still like staying still and then the other dancer again like flips the dancer so there's like water scatters all these like random things happens and I don't know like there are like things that I found funny but I didn't really like like because I I found that a lot of audience people were laughing about these like small gestures that looks like you know something silly wouldn't happen in real life and you it's obvious if there's water and then you know it will be just spilled so people laugh but to me like I I didn't find it like funny in that way like that it's like uh you know it's not like a circus right it sounds like a circus to me it is like a circus but it's yeah that's that's like a threshold I found it's interesting all the way like there are like things that like I don't know like one dancer was just like breaking but he has this pile of uh like a bundle of pasta cooked ones and he's just like breaking like one by one okay and you're just doing this for like I don't know 15 minutes in the back hey while something is happening in in the front of the stage something like that this is like but that I found funny but like when no one was laughing about it but um yeah it's like circus but the way it happens it's I think it's to me it's like authentic the way I think what do you mean like you mean in terms of causality it's not really causality like it's it's not like breaking pasta or like spilling water means something but it it's supposed to be there somehow I don't know how to explain it's really difficult to also like explain without like watching the piece but like I don't know how to say it again just find these little things like funny maybe it's entertaining as a piece but like the way I mean obviously the dancers are like really committed to this little gestures or like you know someone just comes into the stage and say something and then the dancer like leaves again like it's I don't know how to say it's really but I think I feel like this wall thing is is also like is part of this that like something just happens boom and then it just it's just gone after the SEC that at that second right yeah yeah yeah it's not like but it's but but there's a lot happening it's not there is nothing happening and sometimes you see what I mean because like I'm trying to prefer like because yesterday at some point you were you were referring and you're worth a bit of Martin and then I thought uh now connecting also with your words I just making my own assumptions that um that in what you describe it describes seems a lot happening uh but then it happened so fast that in a way you don't have the time to you know to do this cognitive process but you are in constant ciphering what is going on right um well then when Martin does and I don't know from where it comes actually perhaps could be makes sense perhaps it could be something also uh that even evolves after Pina because what Martin does is the opposite he does nothing actually there's nothing really happening but because nothing really happens sometimes something changes and then your brain is changes so like what I'm saying is like if what you present seems like that you are is is a lot of other attention that you should pay as audience because there's so many things happening and spectacular things apparently or just different things like what you will call in theater gags more like the the idea the gag is is what the clown don't do uh they make the sound or anything that is as I got that is funny it's uh so then it seems that there are different gags happening when when Martin uh he's worked often he's basically doing nothing but it's not nothing has nothing it's kind of like a void is what he's doing is is things in between moments where he choreographically decide things to happen meaning that for you as an audience uh for for the perception of an audience like not too much happened and sometimes he repeats these cycles of actions when nothing happens but sometimes he will change a little bit of he will just make an accent we think a loop of four times loop I don't know say a different 30 times Loop and maybe after the 30 times there's one arm or one person does like something that calls the engine but because you are in this stage of not almost numbing you because it's not demanding attention for you it's kind of boring in purpose uh in that moment you you you wake up somehow and you try to understand what happened but it's gone which in that sense is connected to Pina or this one uh yeah hmm I see I mean I think it's more like I can understand like it's so many things are happening but also like the way I relate is it's just so saturated but also there's like a lot of like repetitions like the movement wise like they do like same choreography like over and over and over and over to really like it's not it's not boring but you start not to pay attention so much even if you know it's just like keep going and ongoing that and then if someone comes in someone other dancers come in and then you it's this attention wise it's really hard to you know for me it was really hard because it's constantly like someone comes in but you want to watch some you know someone was already there and I mean I guess there's no like you know there is nothing that she's trying to put Spotlight on one dancer and I think that's the strategy that you are constantly like as an audience you're constantly facing this thing that is where you want to watch because there are different things happening yes or not even like to me even like someone just standing I sometimes really want to watch that person because it's it's interesting you know just dancer comes in and then like just waiting for their turn almost like looks like that yeah yeah no it makes sense makes sense cheers a piece of being about error you have to come to brutal yeah yeah I will but it's nice that you live there because I think will be interesting that you get acquainted a bit what is that they do uh like especially in like nowadays I'm interested in that like since like ocean bank is the one who proposed archiving that they we did that happen about your reasons like the first one like the the template that I don't know if they change it but their character pinable which is done by motion man um but I'm curious to see how something oh so old because she's fully old [Music] um it still works of no relation with with that I can just relate to Rosas or things in Belgium um and I have a position with that um I cannot say it about penis company that's why when you mention that this happens like this in the pausa I'm very interested in that moment because I my appreciation just from history of Dance I'm just thinking that cannot happening I see but this is also like in in terms of like time or the time it was created um I could see like you know if because I know that it's it's an old piece the props on the stage there's also supposed to be old right also like think at one point they put like two TVs but that's like uh you know namjoon Pike kind of TVs it's well how what do you mean it's like this um how are they saying it um the old ones like not LCD obviously yeah yeah like TV like analog TVs yeah yeah but then I started to think like is it yeah is it important like okay yeah I mean you mean in terms of keeping the there is an old yeah I mean TVs a bit maybe not a good example but for example there's like one moment that there's a guy in the suit and another dancer comes like close to him and started kicking him and then he opens his jacket and pull out some grocery stuff here so I think he stole it and then she's like keep kicking him and he like opens like everywhere like socks and pants and everywhere like it's just like I'm always like things he stole okay which I found it was funny and then like I started to think like where do you they actually get those things like they just go to like Audi or like little and just buy these those things or like you know because obviously it's not something from from the that time so foreign we are missing one of the socks that also the grocery you know like you can't have rfas on the in the in the show I don't know interesting I think it's interesting especially from the archiving point of view like like more like an anthropological study on on Dance then um to start thinking how they keep this thing alive yeah for instance like one gesture of that which makes sense I mean a plow that if the person understands that a pauser needs to happen so let's do something contemporary we think the piece is classical yeah yeah true I I don't know like it's all these like stage set like how much they like is there anything that like a regulation or like they need oh sorry to interrupt you like then you said there would be a workshop that you will follow I mean I hope you can follow that Workshop oh like I think that that's something else I don't know what it is exactly I mean I just heard that the topic is the theater this is like stage design and sustainability or something like that um this organized by them yeah I think so okay June 18th or something yeah that'll be great if you can attend that there's one one day thing I don't know I need to check but it's the so I think now like they have this been about Center I don't know what it's called but basically they are organizing all these events I see yeah yeah interesting like because I mean peanut butter historically it comes from the tradition on I don't know if you know those these things but like into theater uh there was something called there's a piece called the green table that is his that is a it's a it's a post-war piece uh what is called Dance Theater that it was initiated in Germany uh very much in that intersection of Dance Theater um that at the end evolves into uh what England became really good in doing which it was uh yeah uh dance theater and DV8 I don't know if you are familiar with DV8 it's a company in England there is one movie that is called the cost of living um there's it's in YouTube also New link is a great piece still it's like this is wonderful um and you can see it in YouTube the whole piece and and it's a long film and it's about Dance I mean their company's dance theater and that carries that uh German tradition on Dance Theater and and the thing about uh um put it I mean that's the modern take uh yeah at least the way how these things were thought to me when I was lying in this class of history of dance um there were these big separations and now I'm actually questioning like now being here for many years I'm questioning like the way who I I Learned was very much you have this different current uh movements uh between dance one of them Sudan's theater but like the main one in terms of motion on the thing that I teach me in my school studying contemporary dance which back I mean reflecting back in time I think it was very very much classical uh in contemporary dance because we have way too much ballet and we have 40 hours of exercise per week with maybe just six hours of theory choose a huge imbalance something that now yeah nowadays these things are not happening uh in a professional study um but then back then there was putting like the movement I was lead by the Flemish dance or like the Belgium dance with all these big choreographers um something I found interesting from the way they organized this dancer's day yesterday was like so after this performance in the evening there was another performance from um what's his name Boris sharamats he's his choreographer at this pinable Center I I don't know exactly like what this affiliation is but basically he's working there and they did a duet but it's I think it was outside so like after we watched the show in the theater we go outside and we just make a circle and they start [Music] and with the bolero music song like were they doing like uh Duets it's like I don't know what to say it's it was like it was a bit like contact improvisation but it's like really like taking time and I just wanted to say that it's like it's just so different from what we watched in the evening I mean if just before in the theater with like full of things and then just we just see two dancers rather slow and you know with this contact between them and I enjoyed it but yeah like because the audience I don't know like some probably like some people coming to watch this these shows they are in the contemporary dance crowd so they understand this kind of thing but if they're just there to watch Pina boss because it's something to watch and then if you face this performance there's two bodies outside you're disappointed I don't know I wouldn't say disappointed but but maybe they you know they would could be right and yeah yeah I had this interesting I mean like the there's something that we I mean that we we have to consider that's why when we start speaking about this application Molina I I mentioned that one of the options to take the would be to propose a piece as in proposing um something actually um something that it has something that it carries a dramaturgy in a way like a classical sense that you propose something that is expected to perform a certain way uh we decided to follow more the I guess more but we have developed with the practice and trying to articulate we think what we have developed something that is more open-ended uh being a performance um but nevertheless in both places like the elements of the audience uh entering play um in terms of like is the audience will come with certain expectations depending on the framework that you're proposing right or do they I mean there was a reason why to go there so there is or not uh no I'm just I'm just wondering because I hear that you know some people actually like subscribe to this plan that they send they send you tickets and you just go to watch these tickets shows because it's something recommended by this uh from this subscription yeah and those for those people like I I have no idea because if someone buys the tickets they specifically that ticket then probably they have reason why they want to watch it even if they don't have any reason they found that ticket somehow but if they just have this subscription like like I have no idea like what they expect or they don't expect anything or actually but it's like if like if you're in a festival that's also like that right like you just go to see a show because you know it's just happening during the festival but I mean but the difference of the but then it's a it's a matter of the framework because then it's uh if if the performance happened within the framework of a festival is in a way I will see this almost like a capsules in capsules and so you have a bigger capsule that is the performance the festival and we think you have a performance too so then there will be then again the question in terms of why the person gets or how the person gets the ticket to the festival yeah true yeah I'm curious like what kind of tickets they get is this just dance or are they like also concerts are they like contemporary dance is it yeah I mean is something what is the framework that you're speaking about is it a something as a script I mean it's a subscription I mean do you know about this it's a subscription and I I know nothing about it but that's what I heard like I don't know if that happens here or something I heard in Canada or probably it doesn't happen in Japan but but then like I it made sense because like every time I go see a show I see people like or probably like mostly like older old people but like why are they here you know like not just in a negative sense but like how again that's this question like how did they find this show and then when I was talking about this as someone then someone said you know like no no there is a subscription so they just get the tickets and they just come to see a show okay yeah yeah because I mean this is maybe something that I found interesting that you're saying now I I like one question is how this is what you're against this your your question um but I think I'm more interested in in the why in terms of does the person wants to be entertained does the person will be willing to not be only passive in terms of entertainment but being active as one of and being considered as part of the actors in in the in the piece hmm [Music] which which is something that I mean with in The Proposal we we hand in now we are in a way addressing both you know like we're saying like Okay you can go and just have like have this you can just observe or you can participate right right yeah I mean I started thinking about like you know if we get that or like somehow we find a place to show it and we have to let's say like sell tickets I mean obviously we all just ask around in our crowd also but yeah like who's going to come to see best practices or why they want or like maybe friends okay that's because we're friends but then like if someone who doesn't know about best practices but somehow they see the poster and oh I should visit this yeah that yeah that's but that's that's the how yeah that's yeah that's that's that's even more meta it takes a bit more distance than what I mean in how to say like the why in a way will is is addressing the individual but then when we speak about the how it involves both it involves us as institutions and involves also the person to take the decision um yeah and I mean and that means also the responsibility towards uh then design and and underscore from our side how do we want what do we want basically what do we want give me what we want from the audience or oh what do we want no that's that's a step before again how that demands uh what there are people who are paying to do this production design they'll just production design and then within the production design then you start then having different approaches like one is like somebody is taking care of the media but I mean there are different different ways for them you will do the the pre-production I will I will say um to reach certain audiences in certain I mean when Productions are really big you have different ways of how information is being released and which is follow established methodologies within design to get what the client wants in this case it will be declined that we are the choreographers and do we want people to come uh that's that's the question that's a question um there's a question but I guess like I'm reflecting lately and I guess I'm trying to be in this exercise I also went to the the talk we had the chat we have good Annie this year last year I think was last year um when we have this chat online um with her but before you travel to Japan it's like two years ago almost a year and a half yeah it was more than one year yeah one year and a half um because Lily shared with me some there is some very nice uh history of net art I will send you the link will be maybe nice uh if you put put it in in the YouTube which was published by Annie in her channel uh Lily didn't know that it was Annie she just said like hey there is this thing about net art and when I clicked it was Annie's channel so then we we have this conversation with Lily uh so I said and I also have to watch it now um and then I also it was very interesting because we were talking about um compromises basically what is what we're talking right now I mean in terms of what do we want you know like when when like the fact that in a way I I have been pushing also as a choreographer being somebody with education and dance like to push this thing of dramaturgy like to to you know to push back uh that was in a way after the decision that I took when I started working with technology then then I feel that that I'm following also the conversation that Annie was you have to see it because I mean she was replying sometimes saying that we were putting back then was not the question about the performance but it was about a workshop because we basically in the conversation we spoke of two different things that now are online one was a thing about the performance that we did in path from which Daniela gave us feedback that was the third performance that we did what we call a hybrid performance right online and also we were speaking about the future because we were speaking about wanting to do a workshop and we were talking on those days and how to share what to share so that's that's very interesting because then we we had already something it happened we have somehow the feedback we have also some position uh within the practice but also we were questioning how to share what with participants of a workshop um which already happened and it's part of the of that Hive so I send that that message to Lily like okay she was interested I said like so this is from where it comes from the talk and I mean just what I said these are the we are talking about these two topics uh check it out and I hope she will come comment something back on that will be interesting um but then then I was reflecting also my words because I guess back then I still I think I was more more um I remember like the fact that we didn't present the performance for the a spring meeting which was happening those days so it was bujana there for instance yeah what Daniela was saying these things like you you should share like take the the opportunity to share with this crowd because it's a in-depth crowd and dance and it's my decision to do like to not actually share it in in certain way we share it so it was not a closed doors but we just put it there well we know that other things were happening at the same time and that was it was my decision somehow um because then back then I think that was just the second time what it was maybe the first time you were there perhaps yeah I think yeah that was the first time you were there so it was a decision I took um doing that way so I'm saying this because uh answering to your question on do we want people to come then I'm thinking right now that I think I'm ready to start like compromising and I would like more people to come I think I I think I'm more in the point but I would like to have this feedback on something that we present yeah well I think I have to go soon but maybe like what I feel is like it's not something binary it's not like yeah it's not like what this or that but maybe we find a strategy because when I did my Festival I didn't well because I'm not on social media that's one reason but I didn't really like push to you know advertise but at the same time I felt like you know I just don't want random people to come yeah yeah I want people like I I eat it also because of the performance I did I needed to feel safe yeah yeah but that doesn't also you know conflict with this idea that we want to show to more people because we can have bigger crowd but still feel safe I mean it's hard but or maybe not the matter I'm safe or not but you know like yeah like I think it's yeah that's kind of also the practice in itself like how to make the crowd that that made me feel the same Vibe somehow if you want but I want that yeah yeah but um but this is this is this is um on point on this is research you know like the point of research uh it goes in in I mean it just it situates itself in something that is as specific and it speaks about certain things uh yeah that's that's that's a research right like a performance like you take a performance as a research it's um I even have heard like so much like that maybe perhaps we can call it and go in the term of performance research I will say in that regard the Joe has been like uh uh he what we call is an examine research and it has this component it's a research um it has the research and yeah we play with certain poeties we think that um but it's a perfect so yeah anyway I don't know if I make my point clear with that yeah no I think it's it's legit and to be something that I mean everything is research in a way okay but then we have to yeah find the methodology if it's a research okay I don't know if I completely understood what is that but maybe we can just close it like this I think and let's try it more to have this conversation with will be great so stay tuned because tomorrow we will have a great philosopher one of the yeah we might have Gabriel Catherine from puff transmitting from puff uh the next chat when we will introduce the chat between some texts that are proposed to now to uncabriel all right then stay tuned subscribe and hit the how to say this notification button so yeah if you if you have a new if we have a new video you will get notified right okay then um thank you for watching all right to turn off the recording foreign", "jdZgqN8KEqw": "okay yes hey uh how are you a bit tired yeah but but what are you doing yesterday no just partying oh yeah yes I went for partying like first time since I came here I mean in this city yes that was quite random I just realized just correct me this is if is does the city from peanut house right yes exactly I actually met a dancer from there yesterday I mean not that the party but cool so you were a party like in the city yeah that was like next to the train track kind of like outside Ray so what it was a rave thing yes yeah German people yes and I was like it was so Random like I was wearing black yesterday and I was like okay this is perfect and then on the way I found people like throwing this you know like this donation box like for clothes this is really nice now actually you can't see it wow you see the colors yes wow yeah it's like it could be perfectly the sweaters that you know you might pay 800 bucks 150 bucks or exactly better like that's not nice so how do you make this with Hydra yes yeah yes well you have to contact floor and do a challenge with her tutorial like do you have to just to say like to hear like a floor I have a challenge for you and then it's a gig how ah so where are you now what's Emma so this video is sponsored by Gabrielle's we have to start putting things in the in the in the in the videos so then then we put gaudio's place as a sticker we have a channel we can put you know like subscribe to Gabriel's Channel yes yeah yeah actually we should promote his Instagram because he'll open it not too long ago so we can promote his Instagram that would be that's so cool that's that's that would be a practice in itself like then optimize resources social resources yes but that is pretty cool I mean I'm not gonna stay there like saying more than this that I part of this study that I'm doing I'm now touching Network Theory interesting from an anthropological point of view and also from the art point of view of course in relation always situated with England technology but we took another moment it is related with all these things of like social networks and the way home yeah Networks uh yesterday I was in this social thing and some people at some point they were you know when you're gossiping about people of the of the conference and at some point they were mentioning about this guy and then somebody mentioned like yeah he's a super Network guy and I thought like oh wow I would like to be called super Network I that's such a nice like hey nice to meet you super Network guy and then when you give when you give when you give the hand the people filled all your so like if they ask you hey do you have an Instagram no but just give me your hands upload upload that to me and then you and then now you guys know each other give me your hands exchange dude did you have this uh like first game boy like console that you have to connect the cable to the you know to have to others and but I never used it with other ones okay but I have the I have the one of the I have territories of course and then uh uh Pokemon yeah because like first Pokemon like first 102 series no like three or four series like you have to connect with other consoles with a cable to trade Pokemon yeah this was really nice you have to connect the two Pokemon to train the Pokemons to fight between them fight or trade you know great I have to trade you really have to do it physically yeah and you have like this like a little animation on the screen that the Pokemon ball like the the I would say Pokeball it goes from One console to like go through the cable and it goes to another console which is really fine but window has been always really other one guard of like uh uh all these Technologies um what is interesting to see is like still now they are very much in this threshold uh although not necessarily technologically wise if you know what I mean like before was really the threshold with technology like Tech side okay uh but now of course there's so much going on and Nintendo like yeah it was not that big company uh that it was before um but it's still like the things the the those things they are in the market like the Nintendo switch uh it has a lot of really cool stuff yeah my brother has me I have been always yeah yeah I should I should borrow it your brother your brother like so you have an Nintendo switch there yeah um yeah there is some there is a cool stuff from Nintendo switch uh it's a game for kind of like science game but because of that there is a lot of interfaces proposed there if you between sensors and then actual physical stuff where you can where kids can do experiments basically so when I saw it I thought like wow that definitely could work in in a performative yeah you can make because you can make something with it right because aesthetically is you know is say when you do DIY stuff aesthetically it's always not yeah always it's yeah it's just full of wires and on um but this is it has this thing that you don't have to worry about it it doesn't look it's not perfect you know what I mean it's just right there where you can just hack it yeah there was this um I don't know if it's just like an urban legend but when they design a new hardware from their building I don't know fourth floor fifth floor they throw it away I mean I throw it from the window to test if it survives that shock but I don't know I don't know because I have seen these commercials for this they sell this uh cases for military proof uh this and they they throw it uh through really long really high uh altitudes but I don't know if would you believe have you seen these videos like sometimes it's like really really high not even two floors but I don't know yeah I I have no idea if that's real but I mean what I want to say is like they really try to make it you know rugged like really sturdy so it's like good for testing in any case like like did you try a real remote a what like this controller for Wii we remote because they they have been like yeah the stick thingy but because that has been like a lot in the hacker Community like around 2000s I think since it's released like they made a Bluetooth you know the connection app for Mac and I think also windows so you can get data from the remote and you can use it in processing or like open Frameworks and these things so you already like get data from that immediately yeah yeah like there was one thing that they were using uh like a few weeks ago when I was here in this XR Festival um it was a surfboard from we have you have you seen this thing yeah and it's it's just so cool because it looks good already because it's just white and it just looks really good and it's wireless yeah it was working really well I thought like yeah it's a Nintendo yeah it's really cool because it's just basically four sensors like pressure sensors on the corners so from the readings you can see like what the weight distribution it's wonderful it's like yeah you come I was checking you can get actually I put it in my notes I should get it in in invented to buy one of these things and to store it anymore no they're not going to do it and if if something appears at this moment then we'll be like 500 bucks with a flying plan capacity I think the the popular ones are like Wii Remote and that I don't know how it's called the the mat and then also this this is not from Nintendo but um like leave this position tracker but basically it's just like two wires you know this thingy like I think it's like for like playing like simulation of like golf or something so basically it's just a box with two um sticks that are attached to wire so you pull these two uh wires together and then you can measure the position the position so these are relative from one point what it's just relative so it's it's basically a box that you put on a floor I think and then it's like a control it's how do you say it's like a fishing rod kind of thing that you know the wire comes out but then you have two wires as you pull two wires together because they you know it has a bit of distance so from the you know distance between two wires you can measure the position I think that's the idea but anyways this I I it's it's better like you you should see it but um I think a lot of people in like electronic music like you know with Max lesbians that I think there was like a maxinesty module so people use it all the time but not for gaming I don't know if it's like a Playstation or Xbox you know um wait let's let's try to start receiving messages already so let's let's let's Chuck talk a little bit of uh and just practical stuff so thanks for for doing the the the the the constant also for the message I think was nice just to let them know that the other we really appreciate it yeah because I think they put a little bit of like effort in that which I really think is nice and it's you know not easy they can just say you know you're you're out that's it but they put some messages yeah I know especially especially because I live in Brussels so it's it will happen at some point right [Music] and they have been around for a long time their work code I think for 20 years there um so wait this is so let's how to do this like the um because yeah we just walk out um we cannot I mean this is not a working session um so it's just I'm trying to be practical because I'm still here I'll go back today but uh I have been this is just practical information in terms of like how to um I have been hanging out a lot with Nuno we get super alone uh part of like some kind of a group that it emerges naturally yeah um and so would you stop the first day when we met I said that we plan to apply and then he just gave me some tips I mean he just said like we he just told me like really look at the um conditions which already we did I mean we normally we do this um but I also uh in Practical terms he says like they will be eight people will be eight people the jury so he's one but everybody from other so it's the same when he told me that I just told him that it was the same process that I went as a jury in dormant in dormant yeah because during that process everybody all the stakeholders were part of the process all of the other ones which I don't think is necessarily um uh but anyway so like there will be one representative person from every of the residence and Nuno and together they will allocate the people so yeah I mean but he said like that no and that was also the first day when I just met him so maybe uh this conversation would use like if you help me to uh to to maximize my social ability with him right now in terms of maybe what can I ask him of um for instance he was saying like going back to the first day he was saying that that is facing my head that that I was thinking like um so you know he said like he knows what we do like he knows like the the that he knew me I guess for what you're doing uh you know this he crosses best practices so he knows what we're doing and I think he like it he likes what we're doing um so in that sense he said like you guys don't have to change what you're doing but then it has to be working for the application right and that's the problem that we have basically is artificial intelligence that's that's the whole that's the summarize did you read the the last version I wrote no I haven't okay because I changed it quite a lot and it's like yeah so I don't know maybe you can say what because you want to say first because if I started no might make no sense yeah no I mean I'd let let me I will read it is it long no then I will just read it I will just hang you can you can go through yeah I'll just stay here and you can just go through because I think that's easy can you send me the link can you send the link of course uh here or no I do it yes um so I think this we did I think you did a good job in summarizing this um uh so thank you for the for the time YouTube and um um I guess I will go also on the text I will jump at some point and and then make some comments not now I guess I will do it more tomorrow once I'm back uh but so I can tell you that from what I speak I remember now from the conversation his PhD was based on the interface so this guy so to underline this idea of the interface um uh I saw that you I was wondering what I I have to say I didn't finish the read but I saw when you start speaking about technical part and then I went through fast and it seems okay um because it seems at the beginning that you were not speaking too much about the AI I bet you did and I also I think it's great because already I was thinking that it's better maybe not to work with Cafe but to find a mentor with somebody who is working with AI because we both don't have that experience while somehow I am somehow an expert in affirmation in in the theater um and that that's something that perhaps you should underline also there so because then you said that we both have so already you're doing your underlying that you are like sufficient and he knows that you are sufficient you're the engineering the team and so underlying that I'm the one who is a choreographer and I have academic formation and this thing I have 20 years of experience working with that um so underline so you use these credentials because that's part of what that's what they will need to hear yeah they need to hear that I have been working with Rosa with this all these things um so I mean just mention underlying that I'm the one who has experience with theater you are the one who is the engineer to really clarify because this is for eight people who have no idea of Technology it's Nuno and other seven people who are not technologists he's the only Technologies I think with that in depth in the air yeah the other ones like would be I guess somehow yeah the knowledge of Nuno is really situated in what we do he do he is a PhD in dancing technology but this place is like travel for instance I know like will be just the tech guy who might be a geek you see what I mean but he doesn't have that knowledge of dance and Technology that's really right situated knowledge so make these things obvious even if it sounds a bit pretentious better I think trying to uh as I said maybe I will then if make something clear in some spaces but if you can for instance like underline that is me the one who has the experience you have to you have to write that you have to write okay yeah I mean like there's also CV in the end that we should you know edit a little bit uh uh targeting is you know yeah I think it should be but I think it should be in the proposal because the series like as a jury as a jury I don't like when I did this extra I do this exercise I don't check the CVS only if I need to but normally my point is we should edit both because this is like like you know you're a CV you edit it that's what I wanted to say no but like maybe what you could like is just even just put a like a sentence then then I just jumped there and what it says like Jorge is a master just uh if you can just put something somewhere if you can because uh these that I'm saying to use now in between places that are in my head so I might forget this so don't forget this for us because I think it's really this is the useful information it's coming from my conversation so this is like it's like four pager and I still have like half a page so maybe we could add like who we are in the text I think that's good to add within within the proposal within the proposal yeah like maybe yeah maybe what would it I mean what I will say is just hear me out like then we might not mind I have to do this but because it seems to me the the proposal what you're proposing it starts sounding quite concrete so it's good you know like I'm trying to read from that like the technician of the theater who knows a little bit of gold who knows a little bit of theater but doesn't have that death knowledge and it has to help you um then so I think it's going good direction especially like now you're mentioning okay we don't know actually about AI um uh but maybe maybe this the first part introduction it becomes so maybe we can make try to make it shorter if possible um the first but you know what forget I mean don't forget what I'm saying like can if you can take notes of this will be great because my mind forget this but um this is recorded okay yeah but like yeah yeah yeah you know what I mean um so that's what we were doing this exercise right now I'm sorry like because I'm traveling I cannot do this like I can I would like to help you know wait so um what I was doing today is that foreign is I will be back in Belgium tomorrow for sure um I have one day home and then I go to Cologne so I will have time to jump a little bit on the attack I will have a I will jump um on the text a little bit but what I'm saying is uh so I think the first part should be shorter so the best practices it can become a bit too convoluted uh so it can be short to the intro of best practices um I think so that's the only thing yeah so what I'm seeing what I'm thinking is perhaps the text could be shorter the intro of best practices I think you're doing a good job positioning what is it actually what we're gonna do um but I think it's missing underlining the I'm the one who in a ways gonna be leading the um choreography you know what if you have time like tomorrow if you can edit that would be great like I'm not saying like because it's your part but like I spent like you know two days in this and it's just like I feel so saturated with the text and like start editing this is just so hard and if you can just jump in just you know like I don't expect you to you know like just keep it clean you know like you can just like dive in and just like just do whatever then it's easy for me to work but then if I start to like because I have to give so much space to you if I start writing for you you know I mean not for you but you know you know yeah yeah yeah yeah so but can you help me can you help me with this can you put down can you take note to this that I'm telling you can you do this yes like so what I'm saying yeah so there is the intro's best practice intro should be shortened and the [Music] what like the like the Practical aspect of what we do what you start proposing is getting clear um especially underlying the idea that we need a a mentor with artificial intelligence I think that's good uh I think they still can be more clear the idea that you are the one who's gonna be leading the take like they take that you are the engineer so to use your credentials and then I use my credentials as choreographer uh uh and yes I think it's good yeah yes yes yes thanks thanks because that's what I need because then I'm gonna reflect on this once I mean from the computer yes yes yes thanks no thanks for for your job I think you did a good job man thanks but this interesting like I already like made it super concise but yeah maybe we could I mean it's like this is something I thought we'd probably like understood from reading but um I think we should really focus on what we do and because in the I you know deleted most of the parts from the draft proposal I started because it was that it was just about the practices right yeah in the previous one and then I was like yeah but that's just talking about ourselves and like yeah it's an application so I probably like that's what I wanted to say also in the conversation you know uh so something that I think that maybe put it in the notes also but this could be for you and in terms of uh this is just Nuno like the interface like this is something that I didn't heard like that should be should be something that we it should appear more clear the interface because Nuno has his PhD with about interface he has a specific approach through of music through interface devices so sliders buttons like Dynamics what I will call that like a dynamic system in that sense like Dynamic interface okay yeah yeah that was his PhD on so he he's kind of that I mean that will be something that he will jump in I guess and he also can give feedback on that because I mean also if somebody who we know and is successive um yeah so what so then now and now that I'm reflecting that perhaps um I can ask uh I mean that was I guess the one of the reasons I I wanted to talk with you is like to reflect and I will see him so maybe um is there something that maybe we would like to know where where is the um where is the with the weak points that we have in this in in this application what is where perhaps we will we will we will would be nice to have some clarification in how to perform better because yeah that's the question like it it's like I only see it from like you know subjectivity I was writing so I don't know what's what's", "rMXflls-2Xs": "where are you I'm at a cafe I have school let's know like near my place um I just blurred it because last time I did like meeting like this I got like really annoyed by the background you know like I start seeing people walking outside but where are you at a cafe I thought you said on my place I thought like but I'm already have seen your place and I just woke up I'm like what okay maybe maybe I'm still dreaming and this is a another dreaming dreaming practice this is another Another Universe especially with lately people who speak so much of this this possibility um and now I'm half sleepy I'm like wait actually this could be happening right now you know like having the reflection that I know I'm belonging to a different world but this is the one where your house looks like this there's people working in the background anyways how are you um I was actually like watching some videos on the heart right and what about and I found um one of the I don't know how we call it it's like a practice but when you're at the Academy we three did like some practices and one of them was like building a party you know like in the in the back in the in the corner not in our space the studio but um and like there's like a conference space or something and we're like setting up at the Academy in dortmunds next floor and uh I were working and you when you were there like we did three of us did like this I don't know who suggested maybe you or um yeah that because we the space is like really full so it's I remember now I remember like to build a party yeah yeah and it's just so funny yeah yeah because uh like in the background like Laura and I were like setting up so many things and you're like dancing in the in front of the camera this is so funny it's so much fun man yeah it's so much fun yeah yeah I I was thinking actually I would like maybe take this chat uh to to Wonderland he said yes and we are the best um just so like just so you know I think that I my system is uh I'm having the oh it's called them allergy season this is starting for me so my system is really weird like I have like almost like a pink eye coming and just I feel my lungs and also myself is in in overdraft anybody's life yeah it's been like that for the last few weeks for me oh yeah yeah it's horrible eyes is so intense but I don't remember a place that it was worse for me that when I was in the academy oh like I remember I remember when I was there like because that should be more reactive to certain trees and from the place the previous place where in dormant those days I remember that and I had just clusters it was horrible for me too like I remember once like also like Olivia was there and I took medication and I just couldn't do anything and I think in the dome I was just sitting and like people are doing something some things but I was just like sitting still for like because you're feeling sleepy because of the drug yeah I was like I can't do anything I just be there but I'm the best of myself being here exactly but also that that was like a lot of organizations so I was like okay I'll just be there you know we are four of us or whatever it can happen yeah yeah yeah but no I think what I was like trying to elect to propose is to talk is the okay I'm being conscious about this uh did you say did you see over um like the the previous chat do we have that is uploaded we have like I think 55 views yeah that's funny yeah like sometimes like we have more views than I have like I was checking also like Orthopedics like oh 996 views so that's there's not just three people huh it's and it's not me playing 96 times the video right it's the uh yeah like not the last last one because that was like a few days ago but the one like a week ago the first one that I have in apost no no no that one is just 13 views but the one before is 96. right yeah I don't know why I mean those are those are huge numbers around yeah but yeah I know it's true it's like still there's a hundred views even if somebody just click there is is a yeah I was just surprised that because I still was used to just to see seven three five I don't know seven there was one yeah that has 110 views from April 24th that you were you were a double you remember oh yes oh wow so but this actually is not related to the last ones right seems like that no it's more like the last ones I don't know and I also like I uploaded a tutorial which doesn't have many views but maybe that also affects I don't know Hydra tutorial yeah of what exactly well like how to make animations with Hydra animations like what you mean like transition between more like Motion Graphics okay right because in processing interesting clear you know you can do like rotate and you rotate things yeah Hydra you have to do a little bit different because the nature of Hydra is more like the opposite to people are messy now so to control is a bit more tricky yeah yeah exactly it's easy to do like crazy feedback saturation but yeah yeah nice um so yeah uh and where are you I I I'm at home I'm the kitchen oh but I told you know that I paint the kitchen oh wow yeah yeah so it looks it looks I mean it took and we took away the the the old thing that it was on top of the it looks nice now nice yeah because like the the camera was like facing up it was like really abstract where are you I'm walking on the moon I'm putting your flag before Elon Musk I'm in Mars actually he's pink you see I arrived here before Elon Musk that's great I will declare hashtag BPD he's at the formula one so he's not there yeah yeah he's a Formula One is there today it's at night I think because it's in Miami Miami Grand Prix such a thing I saw the um have you seen the the Netflix Series yeah so I think you should I think you you I mean maybe you won't like it I don't know but I I start I start liking F1 I just watched one season and then I finished the Four Seasons and then I was waiting because they stopping in Kobe but then I came back after and that starts so the last one that I saw was um 2021. okay but the season from 2021 or the one released in the seasonal yeah this reason the season for 2020 no actually 2022 no that was the last yeah okay yeah there is already the season from 2022. okay yeah yeah makes sense yeah but wait so I don't know I was trying to I propose to to bring this topic of um at some point when we were discussing a little bit of uh who perhaps the invite us Mentor in this project in Italian for Italian application yeah same within one of the voice because it was a small exchange with voice uh through voice messages you mentioned something to change the narrative that we have and I thought it was interesting I mean that's what I would start that's what I started saying that we were genius um yeah or underlining this this I would like if you can if you remember what was it that you were trying to say it yeah so basically yeah because I didn't really clarify that right so the reason why I said it because I think it was from Kate sequel's uh presentation from the live coding conference so just like disclaimer like I think that's really good summary of like where things are coming from and you know I don't actually remember what she was saying but oh yeah like William Forsyth and stuff like that you know basically because she works with dance and live coding specifically but basically this idea of notion of algorithm and those choreographers um what's the other one uh with the with this uh 3D software or photography um like I think it's also like uh oh my gosh I'm forgetting all these names mark Downey probably like related to that um I forgot that I don't think I don't think she mentioned that Mark Downey in her no but uh the one that he was I think also working with like this 3D software like with the human figure and you can photograph in 3D yeah anyway yeah anyway so this like this kind of thing that always shows show up right and if you look at the history of dance and Technology but then like this I think this is of course we have to look at to uh into the history but then this is also to me what limits the like this field of dance and Technology you know especially like if you see these famous choreographers white male choreographer is hiring um technicians to do something that's really not what they don't know is true yeah that's exactly go on go on yeah yeah so for example like I don't know like one reference I would say is would be like Annie like she's been doing from like very different perspective it's not algorithmic but but she does also um inspired things too and like yeah we have to change the narrative somehow it that's something I wanted to address in my thesis which I houndfully I would say more like work in progress but also like how we relate to these like references that are not mentioned or um often or like how can we be the reference ourselves that's what becomes like this genius idea so then I remember then I asked you then what is your narrative oh that's all that's a question yeah do do you happen what I'm like an open question or do you have some some idea what is our current narrative that's uh yeah let's I would say open question and I think it should remain open question but definitely there are people who are doing interesting things um I'm not doing research these days so that's something I should do um but yeah like yeah like definitely like what Annie is doing is something and I yeah something to be referred also like because that's like to me this concrete example and I know that there are things that we take from what she's doing but maybe it's also interesting to outline or like to like just write down what specifically we take you know right cool so yes interested what you're saying so yesterday I was in in this Symposium with uh with Chris Salter um [Music] and then I wouldn't say that it really strike me uh with this impulsion in general with something yeah it was not something it was not a bad thing but it was that was no new information to me to be honest [Music] what I'm trying to also situate in terms of uh history um what is the problem um so maybe actually I would like to share with you I mean Center that r ation combinations I will share this with you and perhaps one you can also maybe basically I just paste there okay maybe you can like uh open the link and share your screen if you want for people yeah nice thing to do uh if I can figure it out is this like so annoying that they make this share screen button stand out too much that you would actually ignore yes that yeah I can't really yeah um so this is so but I have to restart uh I think I have to restart this one too but then it's okay yeah yeah so unless I do OBS Magic no just like maybe we can just post the link in when we upload video so this is part of the of the postgraduate course that I'm taking on Graduate Studies um which I was interested in following because the underlined idea of the shift of Paradigm in curatorial studies brought by technology so maybe I will just read this briefly it's not a long text so by 2005 postmodernism had outlived its usefulness as a theoretical concept for understanding the present time instead others suggested Network culture and metamodernism has new Frameworks to understand a period in which the internet became Central to Everyday Life culture and economy by 2010 it was clear to thinkers interested in the subject that Network culture will last a decade after which a new constellation will take home the seminar sketches the technological outlines of the postcode era all corporate models or network culture characterized by the five most prominent global technology corporations Facebook Apple Amazon or decaying if the currencies are questioning and evaluate as we see the rapid price requires forms of artificial intelligence that as yet have no capacity for inherent cognition but uncanningly introduced relationship or immediately adjustment or related elements the seminar probes the consequences of these Transformations tracking how the very structure of networks transform political forums and discursions the similar as count a new political order be constructed around decision Technologies technological structures well what will what will these new eras markets and economies look like okay so this is one and I will prefer to the second one second um so the second one is called technique Beyond monoculture on the description goes this seminar addresses and aspects of the critique of technology that tends to conflate what is the robot the robotic activity called techno scientific rationality with the rationality of capitalism given the indispensable role of technology in addressing climate change and its intrinsic relation to the Natural and human Sciences this seminar seeks to turn the tables of your feet by asking what are the conditions of possibility for Science and Technology not only to serve the common good but to Foster creativity and diversity that is sensitive to the dynamic evolution of cultural and ecosystemic specificities teleport how much we everything this problem of contemporary technique in order to emancipate form capitalist monoculture and from the inanity of its performance principle in 23 2015 the second iteration in this service center which started in 2015. inspiration for the first inspiration of the seminar was a presentation that Japanese show for me [Music] um [Music] Aga [Music] a Japan house on the 2nd June of 2022. which raised questions about the Innovative relation between traditional craft and high-end design and Industry throwing into relief outmoded composition between handcrafted objects that are valueless culturally representative of specific places or regions and Industrial standardized production of objects that are evaluated as tokens of globalized consumer monoculture this service seminar features Innovative and leading thinking thinkers and practitioners ranging from philosophy to design from engineering to political Theory and Aesthetics to develop a transversal inquiry into recommendations or possibility for a techno University capable of espousing and synergizing with cultural ecosystemic and biodiversity the emphasis of the Greek term technically new things to open a wider philosophical angle on the object's Dynamics behaviors and networks the mediate or relationship with the world and with others as timely reminder of the Greek correlation between taking and governance as well as the rhetorics what encompasses dignity is not only with exchange ideas but also that over specialized materials this exchange is as ladies throughout the market characteristics of humanity isolated societies are in their societies and only Societies in contact with each other progress in turn it is of the outmost urgency questioning the ground on which sort of critical are part of human inventiveness is casually into the capitalist performance principle and ensuing monoculture to which techno scientific personality is all to readily reduce wow so I mean let it think a little bit also I take a sip of this sure because English is not my third language oh yeah so I was mentioning this because it's very very interesting to see to start understanding in terms of history and I mentioned this some time ago like to understand what is the bottleneck actually from Humanities in respect to I mean there is this inherent and embodied odd feeling that you that we get and I mean there is this inherent feeling to uh feeling odd I mean it's not a natural thing to work or to do good [Music] um electronic art work in a way there is this there's something off and it's very complicated medium to work with in terms of medium meaning and so on so um I think it's interesting that I think it's important to start positioning and understanding history uh to see where in Timeline is there is a bottleneck uh in this linear progression from wearing somewhere it starts to this idea of technique start becoming something that is not resolve somehow or start becoming something problematic so for what I understand um or maybe I guess I won't go too much in this because that you know that much at this point but I can say this that's why in the English I don't think that I was reading um and also they were mentioning that the slope existed it with other words but is this working with technology has basically that's what they mentioned in the elect in the description of the program that I read as monoculture so working with a computer is the answer or Devolution of industrialism mixed with capitalism and neoliberalism into a tool that at the end is the outmost um product of uh monoculture in terms of creating capital so the tool is there to produce capitalism to produce [Music] so that's what they mean with monoculture like there is this uh at least from history from academics also they from media studies and also from then you I think you can you can start seeing their two um at least more at this current moment in discussions of AI and cognition um there is these two schools in a way or two ways of thinking one is related to media studies and the other one is more close to uh cognition studies cognitive studies um from both places the this idea of monoculture uh in terms of what a computer represents um it is there as a bottleneck somehow um what does it really mean that nobody that in somehow like you can follow a linear progression in history but then but in a way like it's kind of clear what is the purpose of things because also they're not coming from the so many different places the sources of information if you want and at the point of industrialization uh then if there is a big shift towards [Music] um conquering energy in a way um so I think in the past like the philosophers in the past will speak about um as the way home um like taking it was being seen until uh hiding her who is the one who bring the idea of embodiment anontology in philosophy until there before I think it was aristotlegs through his scientific endeavors there was this understanding of um technique as something that is actually revealing the the nature of things through Force through an antibiotical antibiasis process um is with Heidegger and the and also the Industrial Revolution in the 20th century when there is this big confrontation again with what is technique technique foreign um and then Heidegger start complicating things and they start bringing so then now things are not actually just revealing themselves uh through Force but we are busy with is with [Music] um process of um interrelation with um energy and in a ways that he is he's the one for instance you started seeing a philosophy I don't know if before then but at least from what I what I started seeing or knowing in these studies is this from him you start hearing these concepts of storing for storage a combination of energy of this language that you will hear in technology um and it's not the point of view of energy that's like the big in a way to take away of the of the shift from force in the past to energy production of energy in modern times and what I always mentioning like the bottom is that I'm trying I guess to to see where is this what is the struggle in terms of an amitra philosophical point of view in terms of meaning and and it seems to me like in history that is at that moment of this Industrial Revolution that um there is so high the girls are speaking about the body and embodiment and to speak in these terms of technique and technological terms um then but it's not a clear resolution it's more like an invitation to is I think I'm using words from somebody else here but apparently it goes in this linear way always you have Heidegger on one side and then you have also almost at the same time Simon Don and the French side so German side is Heidegger then you have the French side simondon which is they are uh contemporary and and I think this I'm talking about the 70s 60s 70s and then then there is this guy Siegler that I have not read yet but apparently Ziegler is like they take like a modern take of these two into something that is modern but he's building on the concept of Heidegger and simondon but then again back to the the bottleneck the what I guess I'm saying if I guess it's just this idea that in terms of meaning and philosophical linearity is just at that point of the Industrial Revolution when you start feeling that is not a linear that is not a consensus in a way of what techniques are from Aristotle which is before modern before modern time before priced until the 60s or the 20th century it was there was a linear understanding of what Techni is so as from that moment that I started like it's what I will mention I guess as a bottleneck in terms of meaning and what is supposed to do technical Endeavor for Humanity okay and why are we talking about this because to the seminar thing yeah because so I think I went into this idea like that I said already in the past like when I started uh getting more into art and Sciences from a theory perspective and then uh I share with you this idea that is import it's really important to uh understand and to know not know it's not too much for I guess to understand but it's to know the history of arts and the history of science uh to position oneself and to see to it what are we um yeah so there is a yes Art and Science is a very complicated uh framework so it demands that you really need to go back to the history of the fields who understand the place so now this is about why is so hard to work with the body and Technology I guess that's what I'm trying to situate like trying to underline that it's important to understand to to see the history because there's there's things that have been saying in the past in in one regard on other to the body in relation to technique or technology right I'm trying to find like then what is body and Technology in a sense like yeah like because you can't see it from like different um perspectives I think if we talk about I mean I don't know like I feel from the seminar or like if people start talking about like this Tech Giants it's like the body that if you refer to a body that is like sitting in front of the computer I don't know that's that's just like how I see like body and Technology and then I mean that is a culture right because that's how we use the technology or like with the smartphone whatever but that's like yeah bodies there consuming the content and then when we talk about body and technology in terms of our practice it's very different and then like I'm trying to think like how we situate ourselves or not to situate different things yes but that does I mean that's what I guess I was trying to sit in the long in alone um the prevention is that [Music] um so I was first trying to introduce this idea that it's important to understand history of these things but then it's I guess to say that um from what we do I will speak personally um I'm interested in in the in the colonizing this monoculture which is the fact that you see it in front of the computer to do something that at the end is capital yeah yeah but then like of course what we do is not going to back to this like referring to something like what we do is not something completely new I mean is there someone who did this already or like do we relate to something else like for example I could see like it's like a ritual mainly because I actually saw shortcuts performance yesterday that I think about rituals but but definitely there is like ritualistic perspective in it I mean that but that's yes that's the vehicle and I think you practice so no the colonial practice right to see like yeah it's referring to okay we are consuming the content but where do we go back to and like how they are like interconnected yeah I think you're going somewhere like because I think also we can use this I was thinking in an application in for Modena specifically then um and also because it came through the seminar yes at some point um it's important I think it's one element that we can add into what we have is this idea of uh the original performance because we need a rituality ritualistic aspect to it and that won't happen in 40 minutes it needs time for the ritual to um it needs a ritualistic type and a realistic time is not happening in one hour there was this there was this um there was somebody working with signals by the way it was very interesting it was the only artist presenting at the conference and there was to be honest it was the only one that I thought like okay actually this guy is saying something interesting uh what he did in new things also he was saying like I don't know this I would like to know this he was the only one who in terms of speaking from knowledge he was saying like I don't know this like uh um he was very fluid in his presentation also when I asked him what are you going to present before he said uh I will see so basically base of course because he has already presented this thing but I guess in a long longer time he just knew that he had so I was saying that this guy so he had just that he was very caring in that sense he took into account the audience and that's why he adjusts his presentation okay I see yeah so it's very caring that I told him like that's part of like I mean that's my assumption is that he has the sensibility of the artist um that's very nice so but I was mentioning at some point in his presentation he was just he's interested in working with Wi-Fi signals and then he had this he was showing his structure with uh with triangulations and then he basically was sonifying this the signal the Wi-Fi signals and he will go to the space and then if the sound will change because the triangulation and his body will block this basically there was one person who was uh it was a dancer actually she was She interviewed she said like she would like to know a little bit more of yeah how to I think basically she was she mentioned that she was struggling because she's a dancer working in a similar project so she's a dancer but no technological uh formation of she didn't know she don't have this expertise um then that she's part of this project what they're trying to do a similar thing she's a dancing part so I guess she was trying to get some answer of like [Music] if there is some best practices somehow of what to do in her case um then after that it finishes the conferences she approached me and then she was asked me like what I'm doing um then I was mentioning to her that it it was an intervention that I did in that presentation so I had when she said that I add to the answer of the panelist that in my Approach I think that with the ritual aspect and that's something that I want us to think of that is very important because in this area in the colonizing knowledge that I assume through obstructions uh you uh you will see that the audience as we spoke in the past like so you have this contract person that happens at the beginning right and so then the audience goes to the space he needs to use this sense making it will pass through this sense making process to adjust to a new space once it's understand how it should interact with the space it will seat or it will uh let's say knowledge will get fixed so it passes from embodied sense making senses through knowledge and it seeds like now I understand oh I should perform then distance making process stops and you enter into autopilot where you're just watching or whatever it is demanding from you so because what I want then is to decolonizing or destabilizing let's say also the knowledge it Demands a ritualistic aspect because what I don't want is that the knowledge stays seat I wanted the knowledge transverse I don't want right right voila so that's that's the take what I'm trying to say like I'm interested that the knowledge transverses and but not that it seats so that it gets liquefied as much as possible everywhere and well I don't know what's that dancer was doing or what actually the question was so um but then like what's are we talking about like to as a practice to keep it keep the knowledge fluid I mean that's that's the idea like then we need some concrete approaches like yeah I mean in a way that's what we do yeah that's exactly that's what we do so the problem is not what we do because we do we have an Ecology of work that it worked but what we have to do is under it is is do what we're trying to do at this moment is we're trying to go back in in the methods that we are that we use naturally already that sits naturally which was one of the answers that few weeks after we started working Daniel answered you if you remember like one male that he said is like it's interesting what you guys do it but reflect in your methods for methodology yeah so that's what we're trying to do which is which is not easy it Demands a definite exercise mental exercise yeah I mean I think we're in a phase where we have to I mean the proposal maybe this is like proposal that we need to disseminate or to deliver or communicate what we do right I mean we have tons of things and we don't have to like keep inventing things I mean we don't really invent but um the way I mean the way we work with the idea of workshops like that's why we are doing because we want to to disseminate also that is the practicing keeping the knowledge fluid and runs on it on its own you know it's not like we take something but we discover something with people and that's like practice it also like not just like we want to show the practice but I think the practice itself is uh sandbox or petri dish or whatever that is like it's very concrete yet fluid um like a test bed for people to jump in yeah but so that I I think this is what you're saying is like it's touching things that I was mentioning I guess um in the from history that if you see for instance this classical idea of Techni it isn't there in the idea of revealing so as you said for instance the practice is revealed itself is that we are not trying to steer the practice it's just a thing it's a technological thing that it comes at some point when we practice so in that sense reveals itself when you are in the space yeah I see I mean yeah the thing is like we still need something to to make this happen like it can be workshops then we have to run workshops we can't just refer to the workshops we've done um and also like this what we could do I think the idea of like this handbook I really like because we what we can do with the workshop is still limited to people who can join the workshop and then like how do we approach more people I mean not but then yeah I mean I think like but but I think like just by yourself if you really just follow through the process I think we in a way I will say that we are kind of consensus this idea that what the choreography if so will be in a performance aspect of the practice is uh in terms of method is a workshop if you have to simplify in one sentence what is the performance about is a work I don't know how you think well what do you think about it but I was thinking on this is interesting yeah I'm still like trying to figure out I mean from the last chat like what is it about what's the methodology we take yeah I don't know um I think what you said makes sense but then I think I'm thinking more practical things like how do we fit into this format and still we can do it because what we can demand is probably limited but I think it's also good to have limitations because we can't be in this Ideal World that you know we have infinite time to give workshops with you know infinite amount of people so we need to condense make it concise yeah and I think I said as a joke at the end that we do something with the participants like the workshop and train Ai and AI will replace them in the next shows which was a joke but I think it had something like not framing in that sense but something like that with I think there's something like that makes sense you know I would I mean I will agree I don't know if you're in the same in the same we're talking about the same but um this is a practical techno like well perhaps like through artificial intelligence what we and also in terms of linearity of um I will set them uh following up so there is not just yeah yeah that you could uh somehow use gathered data from the performances to build what you will call in model systems uh agents so the audience is an agent you and me are agents right inner Wars in our lexicon we call like grouping and group elements we call this elements but in in modeling systems it's an agent something that has agency so then in terms of then so we do up uh you'll tell a performance or a workshop or some participle so so Hume some human agents are there and based on that we get their data behavioral data interaction data different data that can be used through artificial intelligence and then from there we can start modeling agents that can be used in The Next Step as a reference as a new entity that is maybe not human but is it has this human data um it reminds me of the show yesterday from Cafe so basically I saw this before like two years ago and uh because you talk about agent and reminds me like so there was this dialogue with the studio in Singapore so there's like a video projection that's like streaming from the studio in Singapore and there there's a band there which plays music later with a dancer in the in real life at the theater but then like this video I've seen it before and there's like subtitle and all these things so it's really like fake that like kapha is talking to them and makes it look like you know it's like a live streaming but it's actually not and there's like even this moment where the stream you know starts like this uh you know rotating bits I think with the loading um animation so basically the video stops and there's like a buffering moment happens but it's like all scripted for face the super smart the super yeah super smart like does one of the critics actually like in the the presentation of the artist actually he's the main critique and that was appointed we actually kind of like argue in in before so when we met at the introductions I guess is that he was trying he made this point to your point where he says that uh science is not objective because I was trying to say it's I was trying to put some yeah say that the artists he speaks from the experience but science has this role of being objective but generalized and then he was really really he really engaged to me like No And we were going to be stable with more people so so but then his point the presentation was this uh what you're saying basically the science is a stage so when you do this like uh presentations and they introducing you um you're doing a research and it's about Wi-Fi whatever and then you got it to come out when you do the presentation for the stakeholders you you is he was saying the science is performative with really stages how it should work so you're saying that it will work in any conditions but it's not true because then he was saying that you know that you have to walk in this direction if you twist the body you know that it will block the the signal so the scientists now this his point was that the scientists don't care so they know they know what are the limitations of the technology they don't they're of course like they won't speak about the downsides of the in their in the presentation um they just do what motion band do that is basically a proof of concept but it's up to the stakeholders to do something with it but it's not a that is not a responsibility that's what science does like that's what I mean that was his point that's up to the developers or that's that's not part as a researcher like so as science as a scientist you prove upon you know you prove that you know it's working and it's up to it so if you want more from there it's up to you what you want to do with it yeah interesting I mean definitely like for example if you want to publish a paper on nature or whatever then you need to you know you have to have certain style which is like staged you know it's not like this experiment when this happened but like it's it's something that you know and then this becomes like a problem with Academia that you know how many Pub papers you published it sort of depends on this technique so yeah but then like wow so like I think that we should this is something that we can use for what we're trying to do especially with artificial intelligence part I think this is definitely something that uh as a critique uh we can do something with it um I don't know just thinking like because this is this is the reality and if you don't have to think how to know too much to know that that's happening right so I think it's important I mean is as artists and tend to basically that's I mean if we have this stage if we have the resources like Molina to somehow do a critical okay critique in what sense um I don't know that I guess that's up to us to see but to I don't know I mean that's something that I felt like was it was something in terms of like the AI and because we have to use the technology so it was like okay we can stage some technology so and then that is partly working but and we staged that then then you can use then dramaturgy to and that will be decolonizing because cities stay with me uh with the instructions so hold that thought like I think at some point I told you that it was this person Muhammad he's a dancer from City larva and he he always has been taking this quote of being the Foreigner in dance companies and so on that's why he got many projects and things yeah so the last piece he made was with his modeler because and he's basically doing just this he was he's just bringing the conversation okay so I'm the Immigrant and so so this is the performance is this about this is my mom and we are walking in the desert tomorrow so in he plays with this we think something that still is appealing artistically but they can't but the concept is clear is that is is on his terms bringing this thing that he's not comfortable with so I'm relating these to this uh I mean to think about it too yeah somehow then you have then the power to stage then okay what is it you're gonna stay sure what you want to show right yeah so I don't think we I don't think that we have to then hide nobody's like the like what's interesting in Cafe's performance is like so the reason why I said this video streaming was like it's like a you know Asian in a way that it's not I mean it's kind of fake but it's also like you know it's a stage anyways and it's it's up to him you know do it live or not whatever it's that's not the point and that creates that what you said like in between this or like even if it's if people everyone knows that it's fake that's already something adding to the performance but still at one point in the show the dancer goes up on the stage without the motion capture suit dances and then go back to the side of the stage where people can see and then clarify starts to strap this um motion capture sensors on him and then the dancer goes back on the stage but you know like you see that this process happening and then you see the Avatar moving with the devotion capture after you know this this operation and that's real right it's probably he has some kind of backup plans but like the thing is like he's probably doing yeah he's not doing completely fake you know that's that's the interesting part that for also like I haven't seen this piece but he did this um brutal performance where which you basically say that somehow he studied Trudeau founder one of the founders uh movement and recorded muscle stimulation so the dancers goes on the stage with the electric uh muscle stimulation on the on the body and then basically the dancer moves with the the muscle data from which is you know it's kind of questionable I mean he obviously didn't record it from the the dance the brutal dancer but it's kind of like you know speculate in a way but also what is happening on the stage is real with the stimulation with this medical device and that's like interesting part of this performance yeah that's it has this threshold I think he has some kind of quality control in his I mean like he has like high standard of this you know what has to be what can be scripted or fake but what has to be done like properly but you know now that you're saying actually I think but like something that I can say is um Cafe has this experience as directing um that's what you were saying that probably he will have a plan and he's used to work in this this big production so it needs to be I need a designer yeah so I was thinking actually that perhaps like that could be that we could we could consider him actually as mentor uh with a that will be interesting I have been since I met him and we talked I said to him also when we talked into questions that I will be interested in doing something and he used he was a fellow of this uh moving digits that Nuno was running yeah probably also he might apply for that uh well basically how just they don't he's not applying for Budapest well I should have asked you yesterday yeah yeah I mean even if we just put his name he wouldn't say no well I don't know it depends no and I think he will be I think he I think he will be interested we have other experts okay so in terms of the staging what you said you demand some magic there is some choreography there is a drama tourism and the other thing is experience acquire he has experience acquired yeah he has I don't know yeah I also like this is like more like personal thing but when I think about the show with technology I think there's always have to be like something like a Twist I mean he does it well with the technology um I was thinking about this yesterday because I have to show something tomorrow and um what's going to be the twist I want to add because I will be like just scrolling web pages that I've been making but there has to be something yeah and there has to be something that you know people think like what the hell that's one point you know like because if it's just browsing something then it's a browser it's like also like drinking with the sense making because then people have this understanding that okay this is happening in the browser right that's you know whatever web page I made those I just called screw and then I think what I would do um I guess no one's watching this so I say it but um I will instead of like just projecting the desktop I think I will use OBS to capture my screen and project it to the projector and because I know that it's going to be like 10 minutes I prepare like 10 minute video that overlays on top but that's transparent at first and then start showing something it's actually like my body like walking around like working overlaid from like like last three minutes or something um right interesting but I mean I like I like that because I remember I tried at some point in the practice with the recording at the point I was super interested in having many cameras especially especially when I was yeah you're really obsessed for the different cameras and at some point it was almost by a mistake that I recorded something and was played and it was it because it was recorded in the same frame time it really was confusing for me even like wait am I doing that right now special quality of what is happening so the time space blur it and that's that's like each that's a glitch in the head yeah the other thing I wanted to do probably I won't is to record a rehearsal and you know playback as full screen so at first I'm not actually doing anything and then at one point you start to see that QuickTime Player and then I just minimize it and start doing something else but actually there's something I've seen before from a friend of mine I think I don't have patience to like you know fake doing something for like a couple of minutes and this actually it was a video because if you move the cursor then you see the the playback control so you have to keep still right yeah I mean it depends depends how much I mean oh you know it cannot be perfect that's the problem what we would like playing with a high definition you know that then anything so all right maybe we should close here yes so let's I don't know who told you tomorrow your impact right exactly close the recording here and then we just go backstage okay thanks for watching see you in the next video", "FGM2-TcY3dw": "foreign yes so I'm still waiting in school I'm in Apex right now okay [Music] good morning good morning what's the agenda today we have so many things on the table right now all right [Music] Google this close this this is [Music] one so this deadline is for one again which one you're talking about constantly we are talking we are meeting right now about constant okay it's uh 15. but I thought we'd talk about Modia today I don't know I mean we have to do this we have to do the process like so what modinas for 24 right 24s yes but anyways we don't have much time like so available yeah well I mean we can do yeah yeah maybe we can do something yeah yeah we can talk about Marina something similar to what we did because I don't know like last time maybe I I thought I suggested like I would send writing for constant which I haven't I just opened something in the talk right now but um but Modina we have to talk together definitely because we don't have the ideas yet so I think yeah yeah okay so yes so what is the framework of Modena but if you said anything better so isn't I'm I'm Budapest right and that's two months in Budapest yes from February to Windows no march to May okay just put it here [Music] um [Music] uh from March this emphasis on exploring artificial intelligence and audience interaction on-site and online yeah so I'm saying one of the notes it says about the audience so because I think the proposals should have yeah they should think in the classical setup of a theater right I just I have this random idea yesterday um yesterday I went to see a rehearsal which I expected something like uh General rehearsal but it was actually like they are still like rehearsing you know like the different scenes or two-hour performance so we just saw the dancers like moving for I don't know 10 15 minutes and their director giving comments so that was just like a you know like a teaser for the for the show and um which was actually interesting you know like to see the process um that is not that I'm not involved at all I know some people but um which is nice and then someone was saying like if you have questions or comments please you know say to the team and then I don't know like they made like a joke that uh you know you could also direct to the show you know we can make the show um which was just just a random comment but then I started thinking like what if like you know like there's like a Sim like video games would you build your cities or like you know build your own I don't know it can be anything I used to play this um freeware that um for like Windows XP or something that you you're like a manager of um High School baseball team and you have to be competitive in the National Tournament anyways then I started to think like what if there's like a video game like assume that you have to make your own dance company and you have to make your own show that was a random idea that I would just you know put it in a note and not to like work on like right away but then I when I started thinking about this okay Modena uh um open call because this AI thing is like you know maybe you're a bit more familiar with this topic because you're at motion blind but I always try to avoid this because I know it's like a lot of work and um either you go for something available like and do something kind of cheesy or something yeah or you have to you know take one research I mean take wise take wise the reality is that at the end you are the one who is going to deploy most likely these things um so we have to find something that you like yeah or something that we don't have to develop but yeah yeah exactly so Jokes Aside um there are Frameworks I mean it depends what we want and in that in that sense like Nasim is an expert in the field right I mean we can also hire someone you know not because there is the button up depends if that's what we need yeah um so that's an option but I mean the artificial intelligence like uh I don't know if could be I think I think there's a there's a wrong direction to start going um now this first we'll have to situate yeah exactly but then like the the reason why I was saying this is that I thought like if I don't know like if who we or I decided to make this uh simulation of a dance company then maybe AI can come in to you know generate some of the parts of the show because you know then I mean I like that I mean just like just I don't know the joke also I kind of like the idea I have never seen a video game like a proper video game of a dance company like what are the agents what yeah what are the agencies you have a fixed budget so you cannot hire a good dancer yeah do you are you part of a big institution where they have this sort of theater um yeah it's interesting I mean it's I never really thought about it I would like to play a game maybe we'll be boring now like it could be but but maybe you know also if you if you but if you for instance if you just stay with the technical part of dance say like yeah ballet so it's a ballet dance company I think that will be more [Music] uh could be more precise in terms of what it's right because I can start making the analogy with these video games of like skateboardings right then that you're collecting ballet dance skills for the answers and then you have to go to classes and then you earn points you get Badges and all these things yeah but after you have to eat well you have to sleep well but also you have to keep up also maybe you're intellectual because in the long term you want to become a choreographer or something I don't know um I think it's interesting like like that I never saw video game maybe we have to do [Music] [Music] I mean I know like that also there are like people there's some plugins already for blender to portray modeling them like to through AI to generate scripts uh for simple models like for example like children like 3D mode like just what yeah exactly so then you use division intelligence that to create the content basically you're you're in this conversation with the AI in what you want you created models and I guess once you have some chablon from there you start doing it wrong stuff then you have to go I mean always kind of yeah it's some kind of how other people are using that's I mean that's what it we have to think then uh maybe we have to go back to what is that um so their focus is on I mean it's all the open call yeah yeah so AI audience interaction and then there's one more thing right I think it was not the other online like hybrid thing that's also like a plus like a bonus [Music] I mean that comes naturally yeah it's not like something we have to design well you have to design but to me like that's like a big challenge like what where does AI come in yeah yeah I mean when we start talking about the I was I thought was more like from uh more through the cognition of some more to the conceptual framework of the artificial intelligence um okay so yeah more more from the point of view of commission because then that that that allow us to stay in a blurry space for us I mean between this figurative space and pre-figurative space that we spoke sometimes um which is I mean in which in dance it is what you're doing as a dancer no in dancing you are constantly you you are in this sense making slave you don't believe you find an image somehow in your head or a symbol and you represent you embody that that would be I don't know a pirate or yeah whatever is that you're doing with your body but um so that's what I was making technology with the the process of dance creation or like the president the dancer is doing so they at the cognitive level with artificial intelligence [Music] and then I mean this one like we could I mean of course we use this practice somehow yeah no it's yeah we have to I mean but we should uh also in terms of ecology we use that and I think I should be part of also the application this is yeah it really I mean in terms of working with technology and not using more resources and they would print um so I mean I think this thing that I'm mentioning about the cognition part like also the the the the the the theory level of the artificial intelligence in relation to dance it is their intrinsicle um so it's something that I guess it would come more when we start being more concrete um so for now [Music] um how we make a connection how how we would like to work for two months I said the last time that we meet that we haven't saw the that we have never been exploring the in a way the choreographic aspect of the or the dancing really of the practice that we have yeah so for me as choreographer would be interested also as the answer like to to start playing a little bit more with this classical uh elements from contemporary dance something comfortable dance or dance creation um wait so I think that's that's somehow makes sense so we don't have to actually propose something that we know I mean meaning something that is finished like we know we're gonna build this performance but we have to propose a framework that allows and it's clear to develop something that it will take some hybrid classical uh theater space in two months yes um perhaps then we can use like maybe this design methodologies um to also because we have to work with tech so then and also then with feedbacks from user because in this time we will be with public in the space right right so the medium is the theater the medium this case is the theater yeah the main move yeah the medium and then if we decide that I think we should we will do it anyway it would be live stream I think probably uh so then what the medium would be and that's that's a good that's an interesting point like uh more than a meta level that do we privilege the on-site more than the online for instance um and that could be your maybe almost like as a question that um if what we are proposing is something that is in the constant negotiation [Music] um yeah how we manage and how I like to navigate through both spaces in in a way that is yeah not the only there is a website from people if they want if they cannot go to budapestries in the show basically yeah right right um or does it show we have it I also called like you received from Nuno this uh I'm part of this group like the MoCA group this thing how is called group is it like a conference no no no it's like yeah that's part of the conference like yeah there was this Moco conference but there's a Google group of this that I I'm part of that because I requested and their Nuno post again so before he was searching for a postdoc in research for this project but now also he posts that he he's searching for a full-time PhD in yeah I also got that from newsletter yeah yeah I thought that's also interesting but it's a lot of commitment yeah I mean like to be honest like if I will be maybe in two years or maybe I mean like we ended up to be honest like I'm really enjoying my time right now uh because I can I mean I am right now in in yeah in a person I can manage my time I have yeah I'm is it was yeah I don't want to to jump into a program like that I'm being living in Florida yeah it sounds great but it's it's not right now yeah yeah maybe yeah but perhaps once we get into like if we're selected then what could be interesting and I know that they're that's something perhaps you can start thinking uh maybe this can start or not is that sometimes you can propose like research like a phds in in coupled you can present like purchase research project and that's something that we can we could have the time to think about it like how we can formulate something that perhaps give us the speed like yeah like to be doing that that kind of research yeah like yeah it's always a coupled yeah and that will be interesting because then I was thinking already I mean one of the things that I don't like from from this idea like to start doing the phds because then it means that it will have to select so I will have to narrow down my possibilities right um I mean in terms of institutions so one of the things that I like now I'm enjoying is that I have this fluid figure also with motion bank and but also uh as freelance so it allowed me to not have to comply to the institution and [Music] yeah yeah going back to that point of The Institute of the of the coupled so that uh research PhD project for in group is that um then we could select uh I don't know perhaps two I mean three or four I don't know how it works but uh would be nice if we could select I don't know maybe at least three universities [Music] um to do their research and because we are too so I don't know exactly how that works it is that because normally I mean what I know is often is one or two institutions involved so I'm just thinking that perhaps there's two people uh and depending if if we understand more or less or we propose what is your role but in my role then we you might be affiliate formally to some University and my affiliate is on all universities but the project will be working together and I think somehow it makes sense so yeah anyway this is this is not for now but that's something that we can think that I think we can make it work right through through our Network one of the places that I really like to be honest like the what are the institutions is your your your University in Cologne I really like that uh that framework [Music] yeah I don't know how this PhD works I mean I talked when I was there I talked to the your teacher a bit a little bit of that I told me basically the people who decide this is like are they woman of the Department of writing or something like that or Department of like there's some woman like they're like two or three women who are in charge of deciding who have this research PhD or postdocs in your school and I think that's attached to something that is more connected with rattling okay because it's like a scientific PhD it's I think it's more true design I mean I mean like formal formally like it's not like artistic PhD but it's a scientific piece no it's a scientific PhD yeah yeah no but that's great because then I think I can reach the affiliation with Claire because I'm interested in develop this part more of the cognition side on clear but clear is just really dance in that in that area so then the cologne has more also this I think with more design and speculative things I get through through your program specifically that is so weird um [Music] um perhaps I don't know like I mean then we can think in our institution more in terms of really capitalize something perhaps I don't know uh as Electronica or Italian I don't know just just like in leans like a Johannes Kepler will be would be nice because of the resources they have there and it's attached to I mean the prac your practice will have to be attached to our Central particularly chronic sure yeah that's one option yeah yeah um I mean in her case because it will be practice based it will have to be constantly in negotiation with art and uh Electronic Arts Frameworks uh and so art and scientists I guess um okay let's go back to that proposal let's just do this proposal yeah and let's write it down a PhD yeah but so so this is a theater piece I mean this right a hybrid performance we can go back to what we did but what did we said it was a hybrid performance what we did at the impulse dancer was that why are you asking because that was like yeah because we call it I mean we said that there was a higher grade performance the website is for hybrid performance [Laughter] I mean it was just live streaming right it was live streaming yeah yeah it was a live stream so there was audience but then like I this is like to me it's a question like do you actually want more than live streaming I mean like what's I mean that's not the right way of writing the question like I mean live streaming is something that dictates a lot because then you know I don't know if you remember you came to see the show in Antwerp which yeah people there and I was there actually I was there with you yeah yeah yeah that was like basically generated on site on Unity I think and then it was live streamed and then people can have like interface overlaid on that one that was your role that was that was what you what you did like the interface basically yeah yeah yeah so basically that's like user interaction yeah and then I'm not criticizing that but at the same time like I mean what I want to say is like I don't want to do that because then the script you have the script yeah uh being completely honest I think also it wasn't bad it wasn't bad like at all it wasn't bad I mean they uh like so they show us as a as a totality I think was good and I think the interaction part they put it worked within the concept what do they try to do it really also I think it really leads does the thing because what they were trying to do was so so technical complex and also not only the technical complexity but also the the richness of the visuality they propose it was very it was the art work in terms of the the formal aspect of it it was very well done yeah so then what you want from the audience if you're proposing something that in a way is good is that the audience pay attention in that framework for instance because it was a lot to see um for instance in that case if you go to the 3D space then the user didn't have access to the camera but there was somebody in the space who was doing the camera roll he remembered and that was wonderful because then you can appreciate the 3D yeah space and then different angles of the bodies and yeah so maybe there's another you knowing camera no I wanted to say camera roll anyways um so you didn't see Alex show right I mean the which one that you have to install like 10 gigabytes no but then when I was trying to ask too much to her she got pissed off I mean she gave me a book she gave me a book of representation that is like really well I mean it has all the reference from philosophy philosophy inside and all the humanity references but also it has like links that you cannot press because it's a book so it has these encrypted links that okay she said like yeah if you go to this link you download it you install it and you can play and I was trying to ask more about it and she was a bit angry so I tried and I even watched the show from Colombia and that was like I think that's you know something similar to the the one in Antwerp in a way that there's motion capture and there's like you know Rich 3D but the thing is like um it was you know you need to run it on your computer it's no it's not live streaming I mean this kind of streaming but um the way it works is that it's rendered on your computer so yeah you can move around yeah yeah but I mean but does it I mean I think like so does I mean I don't know what are we doing at this moment but like maybe it is a chat welcome chat hello everyone uh so but um so I think we should start from so that's a possibility to work in 3D space uh then then there are Framers that that we can use and then I don't know try it um but the more elements so in the trading space you have the camera position so the more elements you add into the work full choreography and then less we will understand at least for now what is that we're trying to propose so I think for the proposal since at least for to start we have to have some some it should be more narrow down to yeah yeah so if they I mean we can speculate having Inflatables and multiplayer and stuff and qtts which is in like a message you have to download the installed mqtt Library and then you make a gif of Channel like but then I think what comes down to me is like with these examples like I think what we're interested can you can you repeat what you said yeah so what comes down is like from these examples because we're always interested in the sense making process and if it's like something given as live stream or video game I mean video game maybe there's more um exploration for people but it's not like you know they can make sense out of it it's like more like something given on the plate yeah yeah and then if we think about hybrid or like adding AI or whatever like what's that part like how can we make it more fluid or something so I think like don't worry too much about the AI part right now like let's think let's worry about the interaction that's more I mean Troublesome and through there I think we can finally yeah like if you have interaction then we can train AI to do something with it so it's fine yeah um whatever it is so I don't know so what kind of interactions do we want why do we want interaction that's a good point actually so answer because the proposal asks for an interaction maybe we can flip it like why didn't we have interactions so far or what was it actually the the good point yeah I think that's a good that's a good point if we broaden the scope a little bit we did have no but wait because I'm thinking more I'm trying to just they're like um I might go so if you think I can follow like he's really like dance you have this classical approach and more like that's a point people start performing and then they start thinking more from start um to create new purposes of these roles audience um performance and objects in space and so on so maybe could be that could be something perhaps you can start up borrowing and try to analyze it or trying to understanding facts like oh what is dance doing with that what is performing arts doing with that because at some point it happens the this interactions start happening and there are different set of different ways of interacting with within Performing Arts depending of the performance depending on the configuration of the space so I think one of the key points is start establishing somehow we need to think on the space like in terms of what do we want so it will be what a sonography I guess somehow um what what is the what is that space Oh what is the Spaceport yeah I mean in that sense like we already did a workshop I mean workshops and that's interactive in a way and there was in a more like classical sense I mean the space or even the one in at the improved stance like that is like something people are there they could do something with nail polish or whatever that we have so so why do we do that what was the purpose of the worship that we were doing was to share our practice right yes that was the decor so that the people could experience these things that we already have saying before yeah in the chat so if you are watching you have to go before and what um um yeah do we want in this performance the people to experience or practice as as we propose in the workshop or what is that we want the people to experience I mean like a very simple way of thinking is like Workshop is like intense to be there Workshop is like intense to be there but if there's something like interaction maybe like it's a little bit like less participation but still like we can share the practice you know it's not completely like one directional like we put videos on YouTube that's more like one directional but if it's like participatory performance I mean with the interaction then it's not as intense as Workshop to actually join there it lowers the barrier for people the performance oh yeah the performance yeah then the workshop yeah yeah okay maybe you're going there somewhere so wait give me a second so [Music] um so in a way say I'm just speculating you know if we what we want is So based on what you're saying then perhaps we can take as an example the workshop we did in Hamburg and then um maybe try to be more Concrete in terms of the score that we are proposing okay because in that case what we did was very much margin that it was a practice now how to say this like I think somehow in terms of having really an audience because I think this in terms of architecture of the space that will be clear that so I say that is is in a space that is for everyone if they want to participate but they are not forced to be part of that and that's a big difference with the virtue in the workshop everybody was participating or at least that was the idea like they should be part of the workshops I think I think if I didn't participate he was just just she was just judging you mean like comparing to the one input sense like no no hamburger but Hamburg was everyone's participating right and then yeah yeah but you're comparing to something else though yeah today to the proposed yes so what were you saying oh yeah compared to this number Hamburg with the the new with the performance yeah okay all right but it's also challenging because people are seated as an audience or not or no or not because I think the theater you can reconfigurate the the seeds but also is is up to us like perhaps we can demand we can ask them to not have those chairs sure yeah you can use voices for some things [Music] um and I think that will be more easy to navigate from what we have is to deconstruct so let's forget about there is a theater for now is a space where people will go to see a show so it works if you want to join with the interaction or you don't want you don't just want to watch something I mean that's what it is right I mean yeah someone's like policing like are you doing your direction are you doing interaction we can't wait maybe we can use just budget to hire truck Cafe to do that work it can be an avatar doing the policing yeah his show is on all right this weekend I think I have to get the tickets this weekend I think so so maybe it's I mean because we don't really have to focus too much in what is that we're going to do because basically we have two months of residence to develop what we're gonna do but it's more like the conceptual framework of what are we proposing there exactly like where to where to start yeah so I think the space is one point like uh so to explore uh the archetypes I will set the archetypes of this of the classical space or the function of of this yeah of the space and such of that space because it's yeah really yeah if necessary I mean if we if we find it necessary perhaps we can even get involved with really with the with the space and the history of the space you know like I think that I don't have that area but Budapest in different areas was uh so it was very Jewish and they they carry a lot of this history from that drama from the second world there's a lot of places there like and theaters actually this could be I mean if it's necessary in The Proposal that could be one element I will put it there just like I said if we if we did if we decide to mention then we can do it yeah I like the idea like I always try to adapt to different space but also it's a bit it's not gonna well it can be backfired because they want something you can tour so just just keep in mind yeah but but I like the idea somehow like that because anyways the practice will be different I mean we have a framework somehow but wait a question mark is it um are you sure is it supporting them in that they say they want these two tours or another tour tour but like to show in different places I think after yeah this development they will Dusseldorf and Tallinn also I think so yeah but anyways by the way hello hello wow it's very open space yeah it's just a big open space with a lot of things it's very same it's very tough feeling I like I think yeah yes so like uh like different people using the safe space the space at the same time or like what's happening now yeah yeah and we have to self-regulate in different ways okay I see it's fine that's fine with how to not kill each other yes uh yeah there is a banana an applesauce um okay so I think this place we need to mention the space I think the idea of like uh reconfiguration um um meaning that also since we need to travel also I mean the things that we propose that uh I think this is is a perfect place actually to start like going back to what you did with floor actually because you guys were exploring the sonography um we think very much uh principles that I mean I mean at the top I did not that was your research but from my own interpretation there was a lot of principles that we developed together so um this idea of modularity I think we can reuse or borrow from real guys I see because we want to tour yes the tour but not like limiting like you know it's not like building our black box but yeah being modular and how we adapt I will say that it somehow is like from from this sandbox uh because in a way I think it still is from we want to in a way build a Sandbox uh but then from that sound box Define some elements that they are symbolic for us to carry for instance uh one of the pro I mean you guys did so much with physical things but uh at some point I also I was thinking like yeah but what happened with all these things um so could be that we also take some time to explore elements in in a in a similar matter and you you have experience with that in that glitchy context um so then what we could do within the processes like the goal is that at the I mean we should know that some of these elements we want to carry with us to travel like for instance I think a good question that I can ask you like that could serve that is which of the elements that you guys have like you have some attachment to you personally that you thought like this one I want to keep um actually like the way I'm just doing the showing next week it's basically like along that idea so it was a good photo I'm gonna just like put stuff which are like random objects but like something that I keep for you know or traveling with for like a couple years or something just I just found on the spot yeah but then the idea is that I have this website where it has like a collection of objects that are shown um to give like you know what the name the ear I got it and some description like a museum so I mean I like this Museum idea always so I I wanted you know it's not just like a pile of things but it's somehow organized in a way I mean that's that's more like archive idea but yeah well I think what I find interesting like that perhaps we can take more a slight deviation is that um and this is actually it's coming from the experience of working in those spaces in workshops with you let people love oh I think we should like the elements will come natural within the practice say nail polish clothes so on um but then I think conceptually and I think should be strong somehow we have to develop this idea that and that's something that also they're developing here this idea of depropriation of your own property okay so you you collectivize you make it available uh so in a way you can make also you can make the analogy buff we decide you have the owners being a tourist in its own property so there are things that you know for instance that because people are people and what you're producing is something that is very abstract and so and you know that things might go wrong like I'll be a metal ball running in the space mind not be the best idea right so then the elements that you decide to put in the space um are elements that you know that you can afford or whatever that goes you can we can afford them to be collectivized for for whatever the collective I like this idea actually I mean we were going there somewhere then then the performance and the audience is collectible in the collectivize not I wouldn't I don't know if what it happens but if they they collectivize something and their theories and communication with said uh their theories in communization and yeah this is space like a pass and buff is very much on that uh in that discourse of in making possible for others basically and what are the borders what are the boundaries of private and public I mean this is like really naive idea but for example like audience like everyone has to bring something to the show and we collect them we have it then on the stage that's already interactive right you know there is interaction on that yeah yeah yeah the reality of that I mean we will we we might find troubles with that in the in the Practical thing but we are not speaking English right now as a concept works like the like one and I think from the beginning if you go back to like um Jonathan Boris speaks of these for instance of this idea of the contract like the first thing that the like the first thing that the audience see the first interaction that the O-rings has with the performers um is the contract from there they understand how the performance will be so in an inner case for instance what I which I like very much and this is attached to my idea I guess Global before of Designing art um this idea of then my choreography that then I'll propose it is the pre-production is part of the production which is normally the performance but also the post-production meaning the when the person so like the email the invitation email the publicity that we do like all the graphic design all the design so all the production design is is the choreography uh it's part of the choreography and the invitation is acknowledged as such is is one first a scene V1 is part of the dramaturgy we can even I mean we can start even like doing you know engaging people for instance since we know when when will be the the deadline and we have already some crew and we can start Pro uh from our own network and start like sending invitations but also in time there uh I know some people there because I have been sometimes in the area then we kind of start perhaps trying to build around some kind of community [Music] between giving workshops perhaps I mean everything you know like just works between Hydra like plans I mean different things so I think this idea of community is very connected so because he said you have Community which is not the same communication I don't know what is communication by the way just to clarify but it's not Community just say that is more like an abstract thing that it it encovers so many things it's not about between people somehow I found it's there is something like agency between the people anyways so but then I think so and then if you go like to like more like design and uh then community-based things so then we can use that thing um we have experience you have more experience on this thing like then then proposing things and then finding through Tech tools ways to engage certain audience that we want so then we kind of start thinking also in literally using interaction design user experience user experience design would be part of that because then websites will come naturally in that process and then the way who we want to engage this idea of the user audience will be there for sure yeah when he was saying about this contract pre-production I was thinking like so like is that something like code of conduct or is it something different but then if it becomes like Community then definitely that comes in and makes sense that as you said you know engaging certain audience so I mean this yeah yeah sorry yeah go ahead no like but but I could but it's probably like imagine something that is like this pre-production phase is the crucial part I mean I'm not prioritizing what but that is actually building something and the show is something could be like we can think that the show is something for us for the community and if other random people come in it's also fine but it's not meant to be for them so another post-production somehow I think will be good like then you have that time for the people to so the post-production somehow it I think could be this space the Contemporary space the contemporary dance Workshop space Circle yeah something along along the lines where the people can they breathe debrief because it will be a closing one so actually also is is the closest moment so we have the pre-production which is the contract that I will set is the most important thing and I like that because in in terms of like being radical or like trying to underline something conceptual it really challenges the means of production of of linear production because it emphasize that it's the pre-production so the building Community before going to the show and and that's uh I will say this is in Creative if you want I haven't produced this video as well um so then focus is on in building through workshops and things in natural are part of the practice uh you generally the false use design principles uh you should experience interaction design and so on to build the community uh then you come together to what I will call the practice that is the show is it time to practice all the different things that people have learned in the workshops and then the post-production is the circle after the contemporary dance worship where you can breathe together and what it could be the moment for questions and options because people might have questions you know like okay but also it's like a symbolic moment to do kind of like a ritual or closing and it could be I like that idea that could be almost like a Naruto's Festival you know like that's that's for me a closing that's for me the post-production Festival idea of so proposing this festival for instance like would be a closing moment that's the post-production for me in this idea sorry I don't quite get it like why is it post production because is is a symbolic way to close the event I mean the the the You're Building somehow knowledge so it's in a way is building knowledge it has focusing somehow it has Focus sessions like for people to learn how to live code for instance to move in the digital space so on and then you show so you practice all these tools and in that speculative space that is still it's classical it's in the theater and hybrid space and so on and then you go to the post-production and the post-production should be in one time in one uh in uh it I think in in the big idea of this post-production it should be a joyful moment that is not narrow down so it's not about building knowledge is the opposite is the space where people just gather around that's what I would mention it entangled with ritual so what do you propose like the the festival so that the or just this idea of like creating some moment where the people come together and make a festivity out of what they have experienced for two months together I see and of course we think that Festival then there is moments to have this more one-to-one or these private sessions and things can happen there like we can even think another small score within the the the festival but I think I kind of like it somehow it it makes sense like we can propose a festival and we can use budget to do some Festival that house it has a space for that because it's not only a theater it's a big building with different places so it's a perfect place to do to propose a festival whatever that means for us yeah I think it's starting to take a shape I mean like I'm fully like um how to say so like personally I really like the idea but then like I don't know what they think that's is it something like one or is it something one off or is it something that you have to develop sorry I can't talk when someone talking with background um it's sick so um yeah like basically more like a practical question like so I think we could do this as a residency and then if they want us to show in dusseldo for example how does it happen and I think it's better to like kind of clarify like what we think about it because I don't think we have to do this like resources the same thing but then what can we carry from there I think for now um because I think the one aspect that we haven't spoke yet is the technology side and the artificial intelligence and the emphasis on the tech side because this as we spoke the last time is more like an academic thing seems I mean through this PhD postdoc research yeah so we have to we have to also demonstrate that we are capable to do fancy stuff I guess so this is something that perhaps the next meeting we can start thinking based on this let it sink and then we come back I think this is a good uh starting point of a concept yeah a good Salon then we come back and think more like the the way how we start a conversation was focus on technology we naturally evolve to this but let's try to go back to that like side yeah so my naive idea would be to use AI to learn from all these uh participants and we don't need them anymore for the next show because hey I will take over it's so cool like all this care like okay we got what we need like sorry we should use AI to create the uh idea you know you have this um uh have you heard what is called uh Unique sell it point on the side yes no use is B you're checking Google meaning selling point in this idea I mean that's your standpoint while you are unique in design when people ask you to in one sentence say what is your proposal about it and what is you about it and so for us we'll be like actually it was it was the problem but now we can create public AI because we got information so the AI is a public now that could be sort of like that proposal like okay yeah the public actually is the AI and it Blends into Singularity oh my gosh great all right well I think look let's close here because it's very nice here yeah but I think yeah we have things more things on the plate and now we just have to yeah like sink ferment and come back out practice speaking uh so let's find a challenge let's talk to the chat and to find dates okay because that's not something not a good moment right now and then just also yeah just let's just chat yeah see you subscribe and thanks for watching yes this is", "1ypRKQbOKj8": "okay hello so Our intention with this chat is by the way I have to be at five I have to go okay yeah yeah um so we just practice it's been a while right did you check when was the when was the last time I think should be more than one year ago actually more than one year ago pretty sure yeah we did once like when I was in Japan like 30 minutes or something uh uh that was in January no like November or December of 20 21. last year did we do once or no besides the workshop I don't think so just in January like that the dance house yeah but I yeah and then I wouldn't call that a practice because I mean that's not that's not the the sandbox not the classical the last time we did sandbox was well you were in Japan could be could be so that's that's 21 so one year and few months almost one year yeah one year is a few months for one year and a half wow which is weird it's like you know this feeling when you are with somebody for a long time I mean when you when you got away I was feeling that and then you come back to the same space after being away for maybe two months or something or for some fun but I mean objectively this is more I guess more sentimental I guess from the place where I'm speaking yes uh but then like objectively speaking I think uh I mean I'm kind of uh giving some conclusions to my feelings I guess is that um we are in different places where where we when the last time we do the sandbox you and me like uh for instance I noticed from my side that I was more aware of the composition of the overall composition I was having a good a constant yeah like the composition of the image I was very careful to not saturate it that much you see interesting for me I mean I would have would have loved to have done it at home because yeah it's so like the space is like so dominant so were you alone uh there was like only like one person or like I think he left him what I wanted to learn so it was very quiet and so it was not like disturbing at all but then yeah like this is like but that's that's something I was thinking it was your room is also like you know it has some information on the wall like we have Prints but I didn't feel like that was like how to say like like disturbing is maybe it's too harsh to say look your room didn't feel that like it was natural maybe it was just just because we're used to it but here it's like too much maybe it's because it's so Square you know I also was very I mean also if you go back to what we wrote what we have we're having papers uh is that the practice happens in all rooms or rooms are our studio our studios are or rooms true so I mean just concretely your space was open right yeah it doesn't um yeah [Music] no like um uh sorry I was a little bit distracted so yeah but then like is it something that we have to carefully choose the space without it's a question no I mean I think to be honest like my feeling like I think it's more objectively speaking I think is more mature because we are not so dependent that's how I feel like because then I will feel that I'm more conscious of my of this constant division between my uh the technique like we are more close to the yeah technical inquiry or you can thinking of that almost like the scientific or pragmatic approach in terms of representation and the other one that is more about the metaphysics and my person well if I compare him from the last time that we would we do we did it I will say that most of the time I will be in the realm of the metaphysics foreign experience of the body okay and the other one would be more about the what I would call representation or more about the commission okay so I think um I guess the last time that we practiced I will say that I will be more driven uh from my body and I think today I I felt that I was more I think in a natural way feeling a balance where I don't feel too much Peaks and I think what happens is that um yeah I don't know yeah yeah does that make sense what I'm saying I'm trying to think I mean I don't know how how can you comment on this that I'm saying I mean I can only speak about my experience yeah um I don't know it was really I mean I had to work with the space right and then but then it's actually it's really interesting question because then like what is to like well it doesn't mean to work with the space because then it's the image but also the body I didn't think that way like you said but um at one point I was like I started to think like is it something that I want to make nice image you know that was like instagramable thing like like before we had this conversation but it's something that I want to like work with the composition on the screen or is it something that I have to let's say like inhabit the space and and then I don't know like I I think I was confused and Confused till the end but I when I was sitting like far I think I started to feel a bit more comfortable yeah yeah I felt also the same actually yeah coming from your side I was I felt that actually yeah yeah I have that feeling through through the string yeah where you have more distance I mean it seems to me natural because and this is something I'm having in this uh postgraduate that I'm doing on an art curatorial studies there is one subject that we are doing that is about uh it's all like post Universal post-universal Design and it has to deal a lot of the architecture and so uh now that you mentioned this space is space is very dominant from anything but we are never really questioning too much the space um what I mean is like the relation that they that like the embodied relation that you have with the space is your inhabiting is is a it's a it's in constant negotiation with agency and what the space afford um and you can go into like almost like a geometry a bicycle and you can start going in production like you you can even start commenting on the geometry and the lines and basic geometries that the space proposes okay so what I'm what I'm trying to say is like if you're in a space that is more complex like yours like just without adding a layer of familiarity uh like the exercise like the embodied exercise that you have to do will be higher than me because I'm I'm in my habitat I'm in my room yeah towards me so I mean I think that that makes a good point so the fact that we both agree that when you see it far away from the screen on a table uh the fact that we both uh felt that it was more comfortable I think it's it proves this idea that if because the space has Stables the space is Big once you take distance from this you're trying to be in the screen but once that the space is huge so like it will demand more attention no more confusion or more complexity for you to stay there so I guess the natural thing to do for your buddies to take some space and distance and then I can feel it also yeah because I don't want to compete with the space no but that's the thing because it's it's like a because it's a dancing exercise you have to decide I mean you cannot comment too much is I mean is you in negotiation with the space and the body so uh I guess it's just naturally your body adjusts uh and I will set almost like surrender to what the space is proposing I see here that's interesting because then this is really particular to the screen I mean if I would do a performance here in real life then I can't avoid that right I mean of course I mean it depends but if the public audience can be like anywhere then I can't hide right or take distance no and I think I think that's part of the of the vulnerability that's what I was trying to mention when you put that's what what I was trying to comment when you uh I think you're kind of were trying to put this uh open question as um do we want to control this pay somehow do we want to have the same setup um and and I think uh the fact that so in this case because it just it's just by chance uh the space is like that and the configuration is like that I mean it just makes more more vulnerable the practice which is not bad it's just it it's just more vulnerable yeah because we both have to adjust in that sense like one hour is too short I mean one hour is like minimum to like you know start feeling with the space then you can add things on top of it I think that's why maybe like that's why I felt like it was not enough yeah yeah maybe that's it makes sense because if we think in buff in buff I was more or less in that situation like buff was although is my room being puffed like it is not my room and I'm somewhere else so like doing the two hour sessions there it was more natural like one hour what we call development yeah which is about adjusting or yeah yeah and then so one hour in terms of adjusting and then the second hour which is the practice right interesting welcome back to the practice [Laughter] wow man one year and a half almost one year and a half is a long time huh totally yeah what we usually talk in the chat or anything like what was the last chapter thing about in this playlist will be about what was it about your experience in Hamburg and the oh yeah too um what was the main topic of that you were talking uh uh how do we frame it yeah like working with other people like giving space respecting each other yeah you like big things yeah and actually like yeah the the fact of having Body Machine practices yeah yeah I mean I also did like a 30-minute uh practice there at the at the workshop like how we would do I mean with people with people yeah okay and that I felt it was easier so much easier nearly because they are bodies and I don't have like you know pressure to do something because I know that something will happen if people are there the new thing it has to wait I was just wondering can you hear me yes yes don't you think it might be uh has to be with knowledge like in terms of like in Hamburg uh you know where you are leading yeah because you I mean you are like the yeah you're you're leading the the practice but in the practice I mean we are to this neutral space where we both are very good at practicing and experts we are experts we are one of the most yeah you are one of the best practitioners but I'm also one of the best practitioners so personal knowledge is yeah it's tough yeah yeah but I I I think that's that's the important point and also like you know uh dads like about giving space giving you know not like it's not about like doing something that that is good right let me come back to this again again but I could spend like one hour coding but it's not something that's not something I want yeah because but that's the thing because this practice situates like at the at the border uh live coding is very embedded in this uh but like that's why it makes it also not live coding is the fact that it's a private life coding right oh and I was really frustrated by the audio because um I couldn't record like I didn't know that but I think this Mac OS is older so I can't record the sound or something I think on my MacBook I could do it without uh installing extra things oh yeah I think and then your audio dropped like once in a while and at the last part I didn't hear you I didn't hear not nothing no and that I felt it was really like you know like something like big chunk of you know information is missing because of that I see I mean I thought to be honest I found it very I followed an interesting um because it was not an easy exercise so in that sense I found it was interesting also I mean I speak from from my experience um I was really happy like with this um I think since I'm the one from the two who has less experience I mean with working with technology that was something that always was like what has been or still it is um a stress on me uh when we go to a technical space [Music] explode so how much stress I get and so on uh do I have to ask if I really get stuck or these things um so I was happy that so that's why I was mentioning that in the past I guess that for if all mentioning to you you're like yeah it's weird to say a few years ago but we can say like a few years ago well like in the past I will be more driven through my Body Experience so through the metaphysics of the practice and and be caught within my own wishes and desires uh well today although they are there I thought it was a nice balance between these but I also just deploying what I could I mean or this uh enter into this dialogue but I will call more like a symbolic representation which it is is entangled within knowledge and techniques and so on and it was funny like when at one moment like we both started using the chroma and I like like the but did you did you did you did you choose some green stuff before or they were just by chance around it's just by chance nice that they were green yeah oh yeah there's like a lot of material here so I I thought okay probably I can find something yeah I guess we wrap up yeah yeah yeah yeah I started preparing it's annoying this camera tracking thingy face tracking Studio I was thinking like we should do like face tracking at some point I mean I mean you don't have to but like I thought that's something like an element I don't know if it's for practice or something else but um it's tracking how like put an example like Yumi face tracking from what would you just put an example no I was just thinking because uh Jeremy baby like we met and he was like explained to me uh Snapchat uh but it's called the the editor lens lens Studio or something yeah yeah like uh you know putting some 3D models and stuff yeah I don't know it's just like I wanted to come back to that at some point because I used to do that and also like I'm I'm working I mean I will be working more in 3D in the coming months so that would be interesting um but yeah definitely I mean for do these things like we need space we need time basically and that's yeah uh okay maybe we should close here okay so uh please like the video yes and for me don't forget to stop recording yes please don't forget I", "4TSHFxAI7fs": "oh hello so so constant so maybe I don't know open yeah sorry he's opening the file yeah maybe um it was connected to something that I think I didn't uh it was about so this application is about Labor I mean it's not about labor but it's about videos right um right so then I was reflecting a bit uh um on labor basically today uh Labor Day then I thought and wow that since we are as artists we blend this in such a ways that we don't know when the personal and when the word starts um um yeah I was just I was just trying to introduce this this no that um well I was like I wanted to share something like in that um along that line basically I mean it's not directly about today but more like yesterday I had some how to say it wasn't a drama but um basically so I have some content on on a server that I'm running so that's like related to like you know having like your own server and how can you like you know not rely on Google or like these big tech companies so I kind of support this idea of like having your own server and whole stuff but then that comes with um you know with the price that you have to maintain it yourself and so that comes with the labor obviously and sometimes like you really have to well basically the problem I had yesterday was that I completely forgot that this I'm using my professor's server and they are moving to another University so they have to shut down the server at the end of April and you showed them completely yeah it's still up so it was not shut down but they told me that it's going to shut down so and I completely forgot about it until yesterday and I had to move stuff and that's like okay I you know for my content I'm responsible for that or accountable for that so whatever like website for myself is down it's fine I take that blame and I don't really care to be honest like if it's down for one day one week it's fine like something is missing it's okay then the whole problem came when I noticed that there is a script that is running for a project that I I've been in touch with them to set up their own server but it never happened I mean it is slowly happening but not yet so that's a big problem because that's not my project and they I didn't know that but they have a presentation this month so they're working on it right now so they definitely need that server to run the script for their project which is running but you were but then it's it's a script that you're that you were building for them I wrote and that's running every minute or something and yeah that has to run that needs a server to run and right yeah yeah it's gonna be a problem if that is missing then the whole website doesn't work if that script is not running so wait I'm trying to understand so they expect that that would be running yes what they see is the website they edit something and the website changes that's what they see but in the back end I mean there is a back end and yes script has to be running and that has been on my professor's server so right I was I was telling them you know this is not good we need to set up you need to set up your own server and yeah they just still take it serious I mean it is happening um but it's just taking so much time and that's not cool because then you know it's not like you know the website is down and I take the the blame but it's like it has to run for the person mm-hmm yeah yeah same yeah and also like you know one of them was suggesting okay maybe we can rent something and you know you can move it there but then like yeah but someone has to do that it's not like you copy the script and it's done you have to set it up properly so the web server and everything so back end is like it's really labor intensive I have to say but that makes me think there was something uh I don't know in which context I heard is will come like I heard this idea that so we think this uh I might help you I mean in these borders right of personal work relationships that somebody was saying that um they rather or get paid or don't get paid and it's not I mean for because we are talking about like not really big project let's say but still it needs demand some labor right and it's almost like a favor so I think it was it was about uh that you better don't get paid a little bit I mean or because sometimes it's like I don't know like I offer you 100 euros of yeah I do that too okay yeah yeah uh so the better don't then you then both kid they both ends they understand yeah I'm not paying you so you cannot be accountable for something the life happens and then when there is something that is paid then you as the worker then you'll be accountable um yeah or something that is yeah I do it um I do it with a bit different intention I mean that's also one thing and also like the other reason I sometimes do it for offer for free and not get paid little is that if you do it once then they will expect that's your price then you know yeah okay yeah yeah I mean that's that also that's about Labor it yeah you should do it for free then you wouldn't uh they wouldn't ask you every time for free no no of course not but this is interesting because this is like this is this can be then we can start speaking and that's that's interesting then how we can start maybe reusing and I was thinking also the emotion Bank the Frameworks because with Florian it was clear like I think he makes clear this idea that and you can see it actually in the project that you can see now on the website the links that they put is that they are interested and they I'm speaking more from from point of view of floating who in a way like the architect of the system in a way and the one who's leading this uh development the endeavors then they are interested in in in creative ways where dance and documentation And archiving processes of dance happen so then you have the case of like peanut Bausch archives and and other ones they are there listed but what as motion meant for what I understand as motion bank is not interested is in being a system provider meaning that we are interested in us in ucom as an auto dance company and you have a nice case of use for us to research and there we said okay there is some uh we agree of some how I mean the payment or how big is it how long is the framework but we finish at some point and we give you the code we give you also the rights and we give you this package to you and it's up to you what you do with that because he's like it's like almost like a beta version that is more like a I mean trying to produce something that is providing you with a solution um but also since normally we are not then doing the assistant provider then it's not completely finished like like it's the case of uh Peacemaker um is something that it has that possibility to for people to use and more explore and research topics of dance and and documentation and dance but it's not to provide us to do this system providers then when I mean being accountable and responsible for for all the things that uh that happens when you run 200 projects which each of them run 200 uh servers and so on um so it's more the idea that we create an initial solution for you and it's up to you whole professional if you want to call it like this you need that product to be afterwards thank you that makes sense because that's the interest I mean that's the research part right but scaling is like well it's another kind of research but it's more like you know yeah like a system that's what yeah then because then we are not Studio we are research place and then we were talking with the Florian and sometimes oh okay but what if you start reading the studio and then no no because of different things um meaning the main problem of not having a studio with motion Bank is that we don't we won't have enough clients to sustain the workers and their framework as an independent Studio who maybe will provide existence and so on um so because of that then basically then we stay in the research area yeah makes sense yeah like in my case like it's a bit tricky that it's it has to work I mean that's something had to be in the contract like how long I'm maintaining this I mean this is will be in the upcoming contracts but the first one I don't know how we framed it anyways I don't want to say anything wrong while we're recording but but yeah definitely like that's that's the tricky thing with the back end because it's not like you create something and that's it I mean you could say that's it but then you know you have to explain the risk that okay this might not work like next month you know because it's a back end but what is interesting like them trying to extend this and this conversation and connecting this what we experience in in Lima uh and that's impossible of uh preservational digital art um is that what cities like an artboard works if you talk about artworks so not uh design Solutions right and products but artworks they my they might just have a as anything in life you just have a lifespan and that's something that I was not I mean we mentioned I guess it does it was mentioned briefly in this meeting uh I mean in the simple in this worship time where Annie present her work at some point somebody was speaking about this but I didn't I guess reflect too much on this but I heard another place out in France with some people in this in this XR symposiums somebody was going to that topic again and then I was reflecting a little bit more uh from the point of view of the artists actually because there was also this case of when they have to move artworks which are art installations like like early art installations um to another location uh and then because it changes then also they change the medium and so all this uh intertwined um practicalities that must be taken into account for the artwork to work again so uh in terms of code but also in terms of content also uh as in digital content but also in the formal shape of how is presented um so I think um the voice of the artist it should still I mean I think it should be still very much in the contrast somehow like clearly defined I mean me as an artist I think I would like to have the last decision of what happens or I sell you all the credits and then I know as an artist that you might do whatever you want with that code that you have on with the physical form of my artwork yeah but that's like something I I think I've been like thinking lately like in a way before I was a bit more like a purist that if that's like a code that's generating visuals or whatever I think the code is it is the important part right because it's generating like it's it's a source in source code but now I feel like probably it's because of the practices we've been doing um whatever we do we should have videos because code it's possible that you know next day or after an hour code doesn't work anymore but if you have a video at least you have a documentation you're touching something interesting there so what do you say like as a person as a tourist you were saying that you said that that coding is the important part I would say code it's not coding I mean yeah like the code the code is important the code itself is important part um and then in the case of best practices then scenes that come with such a much problem of the code it itself to keep it pure um I was like trying to record like all these like metadata we did it at some point yeah yeah I I still have some and I think it's it has its use but the thing is like we have videos like that's kind of like um like the ground you know because we recorded as video so it's in there something is in there so what are the videos then what are the videos that's a good question there we are the videos the documentation but they're not documentation right documentation is something different I think it's more like a wager like a trace yeah yeah I think because in my history I like at the uh in Western nationality for the presentation for the performance they ask students to bring all these traces as much as possible to exhibit and I I really like that idea because it's a performance that is ephemeral you need something to to leave there or you can trace what you've been doing I mean I also like connect that to the uh Tatsumi izikata brutal one of the Pluto Founders one of three brutal founders because everyone's so obsessed with him because he has a lot of things that he left like scrapbooks and notebooks and stuff and there's an archive again then so what what what does these that we are saying it means I mean this tracing I would say like for the context that we are yeah I mean because you said about this um you know how to keep the artwork running and to me like you know it's nice if it's working but also like like being future proof is like what dragon was saying all these you know like uh encapsulated like um how do you say the instance like idea that you can run um old artworks but that's that's also like labor intensive right I mean in a way that someone has to build that and as a as an artist you can't do everything on your own I mean some people do it but not ever it's not it's not a solution for everyone and just recording a video can be can be well it's one of the solutions I mean it's not it's a bit like degenerated a bit what degenerated or like I don't know like it's not the art artwork itself but but why not yeah in that sense I mean it relates to dance and recording of dance right yeah but then like that's like interesting part I I wanted to like say is like if it's a document like so that's why like I don't say documentation if it's a video documentation of uh net art or like media art I actually don't like it if it's like a video footage of you know like something edited because then then it's a documentation but if it's like random pieces of videos and all these artifacts then this comes to back to the sense making that it gives room for people to to understand or making sense of that artwork so it's not like a linear document documentation where you try to get as much as possible from the video can you go back in in this idea that you're listening with sense making because if it's like fragmented videos like not edited for example like best practices we have like a bunch of videos I mean we have kind of show rail that it's not like super well edited and this gives like room for people to yeah build the idea of that work on their own instead of like kind of like listening to a lecture and try to learn about the work yeah so it gives room for people to make sense in their own term exactly exactly okay so but this is related to practice and then how what about this uh what about these Disobedience what about the disobedience yeah we have to go back to that right um yeah so we started from well the first idea was like we have all the things on YouTube and I think I think that's the first thing to be honest like you know like the first thing that we did I think unconsciously like I remember having this we when we started doing one of the first time we said like should we upload this or should we we have this conversation of like if we should edit it before uploading and I guess so that would be like the linear way of do something uh the art like you know will be like okay we did this performance live performance we did this practice we did this that we don't know what is uh but is now in the form of a video um let's what we could do is then maybe put some titles a beginning introduction and even perhaps edited editing oh oh it's like a Labor Day thingy I don't know like a huge explosion and the windows were like shaking wow yeah it sounds like a rocket yeah they're attacking Germany wow that was super loud everything um so yeah so I guess we did this like we from the first from the first moment so rather than following the linear process of editing and then uploading something that we like um because I think that's important also to underline that that in that process you edit towards you will try to say it's something that's the purpose of editing you will edit it to your liking right that's why editing processes are so complex to do especially when you are with more than one person uh I don't know if you have been in process with more than one person of editing videos and they are very very demanding because he's trying to put an abstract especially when you don't have clear what is about the thing when it's something that is abstract so let's say artwork it is very consuming um because you have to agree in something that is not clear between two or something that it has to have a shape so yeah um yeah so anyway uh so wait we did so we did this away this linear idea of presenting these visual content or video content or video or content uh so we disobey the editing part and then we just said you know what let's just put it online also it was as response because we we knew from our backgrounds that there is not too much information in the threshold that we were interested you mean like between us or like I don't know like no then something no dance and life doing like projects of yeah video content online in similar topics how to dance in front of a camera and at that moment that was fundamental because there was just call it happening yeah yeah true so we started disobedient from the beginning that was a Disobedience like I mean in terms of like not following not trying to do something good right yeah and also like in a way that's like to add to what you were saying about this like linear way of narrative um it's also like disobedient to like what they expect like the the platforms like YouTube wouldn't or not expect but like uh they wouldn't prioritize what we do right it's not something they would promote they wouldn't promote things like what we do if we if we want to promote it we should edit it to you know like 10 minutes or like at least like 30 minutes out you know with like nice editing um I don't know subtitles and all these things which we don't do it's also interesting helping the lives although we are in that ecosystem in a way yeah but I mean we are not we did we did not try to do something like to use the framework like the best practices on how to capitalize that we did though uh with Google at some point we were trying to populate and we spoke allude in this idea of pollute the search engine too yeah and polluting yeah what's the word for that no no not OEM uh or search any or optimize I think SEO search engine optimization yeah and then that was part of like then we started answer point and then the hashtag appeared that was on this through this like inside jokes and stuff like oh okay there was in this hashtag up here also was I mean partly because of the situated relation I mean or information like me working at that moment in best practice encoding and and then working with dance but also this uh CEO process no oh wow it's already 10 like 10 minutes left um when is it deadline 15th right 15 okay um let's come back together if you can I don't know how's your time this week um and then try to be more concrete and I think today I am happy with the session we have a good uh um I mean we had at least we started this this up this uh archiving thing with YouTube and from where it comes from but I think I think yeah like the direction like maybe not exactly like a handbook but or like Workshop but something that like I think like honest approach would be good like you know we try to like understand ourselves and then like just think about what others can also I mean what we can suggest from our what we've been doing I mean like basically like extending this conversation into the proposal would make sense instead of like making something new from this how proposing best practices in practices there's practices in best practices yeah so in terms of uh um my schedule I think it will be so this week I'm a bit stressed until like like for the next seven days I'll be a bit stressed but I think it's good we do like one or two chats and then the week after we can you know write The Proposal somehow yeah just keep keep the conversation going and then yeah yeah yeah yeah it's okay like I have to go to I mean I have to deal with other things at the same time but I'm in Belgium so it should be possible yeah um and I'm going to Paris here the 16th so which is one day before oh right okay when is the the when is the deadline of this is 15 right 15 but there's like also Modena which is like 24th I think yeah so that's what I was thinking that's what I guess my head is a bit like that because those days I guess I won't have time to really work so I have to see how to make it work to be practical I see but like the week after like from the ninth I will be more available next week yeah but I have to other things I'm doing other things I mean so it's like a question of like you know like should we I mean it's we haven't done like writing together practice so much so lately so that would be nice but also maybe we could you know say one of the proposals we try to write together and one of them like for example I do 80 and you know we'll come back together that's also possible I mean well I think what we have to but I think is is um could be useful is that if since we're having this I mean we I think these conversations are going like in this context for reason it works very well um at some point it's depending of the time then we can propose perhaps that you presented some shablon because I think you're fasting that process like and some like kind of like a bullet point something and then then we can go in that more detail and how to make it uh something that is a together process from something concrete then we don't deviate too much uh since we don't have so much time right um yeah um yeah so use when for you so yeah so what what when when you're proposing to meet more or less I mean so this week I mean this week maybe not Tuesday tomorrow not tomorrow uh but from Wednesday to say between Wednesday and Friday would be good like to talk again yeah when they gonna pass um we'll see my thing wait for me it will work I'm going to happen chronology clear what is this bio mode I I don't have to this is clear modeling that Thursday could work for me okay let's let's try that I mean I can do it anytime so to say yeah of course yeah I think Thursday could work for me like not at one but uh like in the morning could work like 11 could work 11 yeah let's try that Thursday yeah okay yes yes all right cool when are you presenting then okay but tomorrow I do like a demo version at the school or for the school impact at the school I will do something like a rehearsal but I don't have anything yet so not anything but I haven't really finished what I wanted to do so it's going to be that but anyways it's improvisation so it's fine okay uh cool cool cool so this I upload or no yeah I mean I'm fine I think we don't see it there's like two people watching this so for the two of you we are following this I mean perhaps a lily is watching exactly yeah sorry sorry I've been missing your meetups I will try to catch when I have time because she's organizing the residency but you will meet up you will meet her next week now I mean yeah okay invitation to her then yeah yeah because I think she probably was planning to come anyway at some point we saw some some messages uh thank you and don't forget to subscribe and now it will see you otherwise on Thursday at 11. yeah cool that's a weird uh YouTube video so yeah", "BmSSGuukOls": "did it say something it is recording but it is recording yeah oh that's Gypsy that makes that weird uh voiceover anyways so good morning good morning uh wait what questions you want to publish this uh yeah I mean I mean it depends I mean we can keep it quite depends yeah because I I still like I wouldn't have my breakfast I'm not sure if I want this to be polished but we'll see then it's all because yeah is cool yeah we'll see yeah yeah we have to do makeup and you know anyways yeah or we can make a makeup uh tutorials yeah I just came from running I see yeah I'm staying at friend's place so that's why I'm the nice they're us uh so where are you now in Battlefield it's somewhere no it's more like between cologne and Berlin like if you take train does that become a distance it's not it's more like a third from cologne or maybe a quarter like if you go so is it like more it's more close to Frankfurt or still it's the other side Frankfurt is like more not South but more to the center of Germany well I don't know exactly but the the rail goes from cologne to Berlin it's more like no like if I go to Berlin I pass it I pass through Frankfurt from cologne from Belgium I always pass on Franklin is it maybe it's maybe different routes they have but they have like friends every time every time I take my train from from yeah yeah every time I go from Belgium I have to pass through Frankfurt okay yeah probably my could be the trains you know could be the the thing through Belgium yeah it could be the connection I have my train I have my train from Brussels cologne and cologne Berlin passes through Frankfurt always for me but you're changing cologne um yeah no that's weird but it could be I don't know it could be like you know this gonna could be could be there is more yeah I don't know it's like I mean could be like maybe they're waiting could be there is like maybe perhaps there is a faster route from indeed cologne to to Berlin but I think they're they're counting my waiting time perhaps so for me to be there in hours and a half which is like the fastest route from Brussels I have to wait in in Cologne normally like half an hour okay then I will be just wait seven hours yeah so perhaps is that the connections could be the connections yeah that's possible anyways yes anyways so yeah I mean I was very stressed yesterday and that's like actually it kind of related to I didn't have much time to think about the the proposals that's that's something we want to talk about right yeah by the way happy workers day happy workers day and I was like happy Labor Day this is actually so a friend of mine was telling me that this is actually illegal but we're doing it's a creation yeah I was like so it's a bit crazy because last night like I was I had like motivation to go to a club you know you know that it's not happened it doesn't happen often for me right like if someone asked me to join I would I might join but I'm not like you know let's go but yesterday I had that but it's like small small City I mean it's a city but I never heard of that yeah you know I mean there's like an old internet joke that uh that says pilafel doesn't exist it's like a internet meme from 90s like one with the oldest one it's very situated joke because I don't get it yeah and the thing is that uh that uh it doesn't exist because you've never been to bielefeld and your friends never been to beautiful so it doesn't exist it's like all the conspiracy theory that the like Germany like they try to fabricate the city as uh I don't know like a social experience experiment or something I don't know that's about what the view is but but it actually exists or you can believe or not and um but anyways like what I want to say is like there's a like only like one party happening even if it's like a you know one party per year and and that party is a good party no like in the city like there's like just one party uh even though it's you know it's a holiday today so there should be like more things happening but it's one thing so I went with my friend and uh yesterday so last night yes yes and how was the party it was okay yeah like like you know I don't know like I always like techno bite but it's like a reggae it was more like hardcore like German yeah no rape you know Brave yeah rape style yeah yeah maybe they're like illegal Graves happening I don't know but um it was good I was dancing a lot I mean we didn't stay long but uh we came back hmm no it's a pretty party no we have to pay the proper Club I don't know like I mean did you enjoy the the I mean you know like the the lights the sound the party vibe oh well the music was good I think the people are kind of a bit lame you know like I don't know like like these white German guys they don't know how to how to dance it's like awkward but I I was like at one point like watching people and it's so funny like how awkward people are like you know they're like dressed like some people dressed up super nice but then like like don't know what to do with it with this music but I was enjoying I I think overall I was enjoying a lot watching people and also I was I was dancing a lot so what I want to say is like and then we came back I don't know around three it was not too late and then I slept and I woke up and I started no I didn't work I was coding but for my creation it's my it's my hobby I'm not officially working today so and we're just chatting right it's a it's just a chat but this is interesting because actually This concerns the application and I was reflecting on it truth because yesterday I was having a conversation with berno I don't know did you meet berno Bern was the couple of Danny um and he's somebody [Music] like really um [Music] I have a really good buy with him always like the way he speaks he's very I mean I think he's um very given and also I don't like to use the word but I guess it it situates the the like he's I consider him a smart person in the way how he navigates the spaces and he's very given so that's why maybe I was mad I will not mention somebody I think I will never mention about somebody that is a smart because I think that's very it's a very toxic word in in this world say that you are smart considering yeah um yeah I I get it I use it but yeah I get your point but anyway so then but yeah with him like I will use it because he's very given he's very caring uh he's very caring uh um yeah um anyway so yesterday we there was this Festival uh in the I'm trying to go for two years it's called Always oscillation so um I was I was also impressive like quote like without Debbie any too much I was impressed like how much things like from the state of the art of things they happen in Brussels like this is not a huge Festival it's just like few hundred people but it's really the state of the order a lot of this I mean there's I mean when I was talking also with berno and also you see like the crowd is just really German I was like but I had all these German people um but it comes I get from people who work with sound I guess um and that and that really threshold with the state of the art I think [Music] um um so wait it's Q ucilations yeah I think I found it okay yes [Music] um yes so check the performance so wow I mean everyone split baby whatever um the performance of yesterday so first like I'm trying to go to this performance for three years I guess I didn't really make an effort at the end never happened but um two days ago a friend of mine offered me a ticket to see the the closing performance of uh that it was called uh at eight there was a performance of uh um if you go to the 30 yeah yes wow so the thing was uh at the church and so I met berno by chance and it was great because so berno really knows this crowd I just came because I have a ticket uh from my friend who couldn't make it and then okay so they asked he situated me like what is this Festival who is that person who apparently somebody who I mean the guy's like 80 something years old he's a Belgium artist it's kind of like a legend in these circuits um and the guy just do a like I think it's almost one hour of oscillations with the pipes sound oscillations through the pipes like organ pipes wow so it was a trip like it was really like the only time that I could compare with that I don't know if I share this experience with you but it was the the first time I went towards electronica that I told you that I have this experience that one one of the teachers of the school in this Festival that they organized the last two days in the work styled work workhouse uh the dead Mateus was also organized in that Festival um it's a sound Festival and this guy called Enrique [Music] he was using we think his sound uh setup that by the way is completely pitch black you don't see anything I mean you almost see nothing and it's just really blatting in this in this black Cube they close the doors almost um so uh yeah it's really strong for the body you just basically you trip or you get out because you're really passive you pass this threshold really fast of hurting yourself because it hurts um but then if you if you pass that threshold you are just tripping because it's a physical thing that it takes the your body yeah you know blood you feel it's completely you are tripping yeah um this guy was using and in his Set uh uh they take this samples of the take off of an airplane and that thing was really it was so intense like because it was this Sonic sensation on the body like I just I kind of still feel it a little bit but that's that that sensation is stating my body for some months like was so intense this it was a Sonic thing like in feedback like oh yeah and it has this kind of uh a roller coaster feeling that you go wow and it's weird because then you're heading away also thinks that I mean the thing is your body you have this uh vertigo feeling but you know that you're standing you see what I mean so yeah it's like it's completely you're disembodied um yeah you should really go to music Montreal that's like like one of the biggest festivals in that area I think yeah so I think the only time that I feel so that was the first time I feel something like this through sound and this is the second time that I feel something so intense um it was yeah it was tripping because then you have these organs and it's the same thing um yeah it was very it was very nice it was very very nice experience but also very demanding now for anybody once he finishes then you are like whoa I have to go back in the bicycle home yeah I also talking to her about you know like just being normal like just being rational it's really difficult because you are in this state of sense making yeah it's interesting sense making like but it's a completely different way that you have to how to say it's normal sense making is like somehow you rely on your sense but this is something that you have totally different sense that you have to process completely like um I mean I think like I think I don't maybe I don't get your point because I think like like you have this sense making is just that you use more your senses when you don't know when your head when you cannot go wait so normally we're going out to Pilot then we will have to use less senses because not most of our life is autopilot when you don't know the spaces you have to go through so the theory of sense making I mean from science like is that it's a it's a social theory then when you are new to space you don't know the cues so you have to use more your senses in relation with the um symbolism that is based already you need to situate yourself um to your body and the senses so but so when and the classical example of that is that you go you are new in in the in the workspace and you go to the coffee machine um you need to start like think I mean it's it's not is that bi-directional exercise because it's your senses but also you need to start I mean you need to use your symbolism so maybe is that what you're trying to say like in that I mean that's the the classical look I mean the the sense making is just this uh this idea yeah I think I like get that that's classical since uh maybe I wouldn't say it's opposite but it's like a different layer because if you have like really strong stimulus then you what do you question is not like you know if you're not in a unfamiliar place where you can actually actively sense something what you can look around or you can observe something but in these performances for example is something that is invasive to you and that you have to process right yeah yeah and then the natural response that you do and you see everybody does is closing your eyes sure yeah yeah and yeah in that sense yeah maybe makes it make it make sense to like the entire because if since we are more we are visual uh visual beings um so uh then it's easy for Ford or ears to to close our eyes no then the information is more focused on the on the auditive sensory and after a while then you start getting more information you know you're more tuned to receive more information you are more sensible to the it was wonderful like this thing is because it has I mean it's just the basic idea of oscillation as you know it's just there is offset right because there is this offset in the signal then in between uh micro tonalities happens so you have tone and an offset tone and these waves they go um they're slightly offset and in time they start creating they start sometimes yeah they start creating this multitude of things uh microtonalities and other things that happen within the space and and this is the first time that I heard that the like organ in that way and I was asking actually berno and I was questioning just because I was just questioning if in the past like I mean so in the mid in medieval times um people were maybe using these organs a little bit like that because I mean you're just surrendering your body you know you cannot do anything [Music] um uh but no he told me that uh that this is just this mother now this idea like exploring these sounds but perhaps people in Hidden times they will I mean they would hide and do things um because I mean socially culturally you could easily say that the whole idea of Christianity it basically it shares guilt with you as Christian then you should be a a shame of your body so there is this constant uh denying of the Instinct the human instinct and the the body basically being naked the the holy scene I mean they've seen the initial the first scene and then covering yourself uh so it's all this this construction on denying your body uh but so in experience like this what you have is basically the opposite you are in your body completely you are in this I mean you are experiencing uh your body through not uh uh this thinking uh way but it's just through a bodily relation with your body yeah so more animal than sapins it's interesting yeah I was like thinking a bit like like your analog VR is like that too in a way I mean I never tried it so I don't know but um uh I mean wait I'm trying to connect but I just said can you make some to make it more yeah no okay it is true that I mean the whole idea with the VR is very simple yeah it's just trying to do uh an analog experience as the uh of what you will experience basically in VR in that sense it's trying to take you away from the normal thinking body and keep put you in the space of the sense making space yeah but then VR is like is like kind of I didn't see it this way but it's like a collision of these like two worlds because I think um how to say some people want to make VR that looks natural right is that like not how to say for example like this is like more like idealistic but uh you can experience being somewhere else in a more like a high fidelity way that you don't feel uncomfortable with your you know like to not have uh how they say yeah like don't feel uncomfortable like compared to what you were saying what we were saying before it's like about like confrontation with the body the different space that you could do in VR which is actually easier with like generative art for example because then it's something that has totally different Universe to the different rules then but I mean in in terms of worlding right yeah them sort of world creation yeah yeah sure this like you know more like let's say abstract uh uh representation not the representation I don't know I yeah I don't know the right words but uh like on one hand like people are trying to make it like photorealistic that feels natural and on the other hand you could explore like like for example what you're doing yeah but I mean actually this is more I mean I'm getting more information on papers and things information on these topics and this actually is it's not an uh I mean although you know like right away we will think and that's I mean that will be that what the industry is doing is trying to take this path but it's absolutely you know not working it's not gonna work I mean it will take time like because say so I hear I read somewhere Carl Malo now he said that maybe he says from somewhere else but he says that then history like uh of Art and Science and Technology uh you can see that uh art always comes first no the art always comes first of the Vanguard trying to explore things then signs catch up and then culture comes right uh and the problem he's trying to situate that the problem the humanity has is culture and we always like that's why we have clashes basically difference I mean yeah culture societies differences at culture um and so what what a problem that I start seeing in VR and other people it starts at the scene in MBR is that because I mean it also it happens with other Technologies but it's especially especially toxic and could be very dangerous in VR is because you can the person as in the Sonic performances they have no agency I mean they are inverse in that space from which they are just there you put them in the glasses if they don't close their eyes they are in a place where they are absolutely vulnerable to whatever me as Creator want to portray and there's some people start talking about neural rights for instance uh to the right of one to protect uh cognition somehow because if you are in the BR space for instance you that's that's yeah so you basically you are in Spanish like you are there um you can not I mean you have to close your Gates or and get out but if you are opening your your eyes you are completely vulnerable um so what I was trying to point I was trying to make is that yes uh so in places like France that you see they have these big efforts where they almost have this ministry it's not a Ministry because it's the ministry of a culture that has this Frameworks called the CNC CNC but also they have this cnxr friends so the CNC is the default National the cinema in France okay Cinema National whatever and Foundation but now but now now there exists this thing consumedness it's crazy like when I was there I was just I was I was flipping like I put it just here like no wait let's put it maybe in the chat um so it's crazy because they have these efforts like National efforts um and the main thing I mean so like uh what I see in the last two weeks is like this is the ideas for uh masses no yeah right yeah this is for masses so um we will not get into that problem let's start going into why or so but because they're trying to do this so this is for the masses so as much people you can uh so make it accessible to much people as possible um then you have the problem how did I start by because I got lost now how why how did I start I say invasiveness cognition right basis yeah so yeah but at some point I got lost in in Carol nothing this idea of like art science culture and I got lost why I was trying the point I was trying ah yeah yeah wait so the the thing is so normally that's why art like you need art because art like by Nature like art doesn't need to justify it that's something that I read some days ago and I like that the idea that uh the art is never good or bad because it's always in judge so at the same time that's why you cannot judge it because art judges itself and then if you go out in the past you have these ideas like the of uh this the Masterpiece you know that you have the genius the art the genius The Artisans the genius um so it it's always at the wrong guard of like pushing but it's possible uh but whatever is in culture actually um but then because then you put it in the when Once once you started like the presenting content one-to-one to people um and just and art is not there so so there are three steps no so art science and and and culture in a way like science takes that process I mean techno science has this process also more than nowadays will be more techno signs has this process of acculturization of the art somehow it it uses it takes things from for the state of the art of artists and then they put them in a way like the people I mean somehow that are useful for certain uh cultural purpose through science so um but then because then you have so then you have the third point you have the you have the culture from uh where they try to put the the intention of these places like the the cnxr is to give the the who's on creating more content for one to one person but the content has no is not situated because it has not passed yet through not even art because it's not art really there's no really art producing XR not really not too much and so therefore also science of course is not even there because the artists are not there right right the artist has not start creating content so of course the science also is not there but there is a lot of mass now and in France for instance there is and in this Festival you see the families going in there so there is a lot of content you go to the stores and there's a lot I mean there is this the technology is accessible um and that's why I was trying to to introduce this idea there is so so dangerous because it's a wild wild west and that it should that we need efforts to give uh Frameworks where artists can start pushing this because then science can catch up okay following that following that uh idea that are signs and then culture um interesting thing I mean I don't know about this like principle the more like a principle of this art science culture thing um but that like what I can relate is like a Industrial Revolution kind of thing right it's like you know you bring XR whatever it is without the context or content and then yeah I mean so it's it's more like imposed thing that then like people have like will to use it I mean I guess that that's I'm trying to like digest what you said like what happened like what happens if art doesn't come first that's how we I mean that's that's I mean that's the play that I have in in different uh conversations that I have heard of paper that I have read and there is this open question that you are mentioning because what so nobody knows but what is is uh is happening and can is that also could be completely beneficial because also it just offers and it might offer a new paradigm shift of the whole human perspective um but I mean that's why I was mentioning science science in that in that in that the story works as regulator what it let it pass to the masses in culture it's okay there's not a problem with a few artists or so because the work of the artist is defining and its own life and be completely miserable in that existential Quest right but then culture it helps us as a regulator for sorry then science then works as a regulator through Sciences for the culture for culture and let it pass things you know in a more safe way he uh that being that's been that's been the process historically since science science exist um then but then yeah then the yeah now is like um there is often people who speak out because we are speaking here about social a social problem then then you go to the social aspect of VR and then people speak often of things that happen in VR chat myself I have not tried yet um but it's just a wild landscape based apparently uh and can be for good or wrong also and I heard I have heard like really concrete examples things that are so disturbing uh things happening within that space and there's no regulation um I'm not saying that we need regulation and I'm actually I'm more on the other side but I think like I'm don't I'm not so sure that we need regulation because what I think this is more like an opportunity to re-like to create uh more like a dynamic system that it can find new ways to self-regulate without to put a concrete or solid based that's the perfect which is the place we live we live in solid spaces right like institutions low and so on uh we live in this binary World there is set on Stone normally in paper and cells and all these kind of things so um that you have to have like something that is more liquid that is self-regulated um is more natural but also as natural it comes with my nature does also you know like nature is not just a nice thing like nature it has I mean yeah this is I found an interesting like I mean the description of like regulation I what my my standpoint on there is that and it's following a lot of people also is that it's interesting that those that space because also there's other spaces and then uh because then you speak about world so is the conversation it becomes about worlding uh then are the users or the community which must self-regulate itself without an external I mean as much as possible with an external superpower that is omnipotent okay yeah I mean it's it's a bit too abstract and we're not policy makers so you know um yeah and I don't I lack I mean what I'm saying is I'm lacking like the you know experience in that so I I can say whatever I feel about but that doesn't really make sense so um yeah I don't know what to say about that but um this is ending the call is ending so I don't know if should we like switch to the next one and talk a bit about the proposal or like yeah yeah maybe maybe not full 40 minutes but let's try like 20 30 minutes I mean yeah it would be good because yeah we can upload it we can upload this thing yeah sure", "smRaweObvcM": "okay I'm recording apartment [Music] foreign recording is on okay um where are we because I don't see you might I see myself but I don't see you what messages it's very glitchy but I don't think you are just yourself what you see yourself I see myself yes try maybe to rejoin the okay recording is on hello I don't see you man what but you hear me I hear you and I'll try that's range let me I will try to do the same foreign yes oh but wait I saw you for a second and disappeared there's a beer strange this time sure I can't remember waiting let's not start recording yet um I will try with a different laptop to see if it's my laptop otherwise it's your end or maybe the browser okay let me let's try a different browser I think it's obs's recording so try with this one but now join me hello [Music] foreign but you see me in the other one you made it no I was working that was weird okay wow now I lose the I lose again the signal is the browser somehow I have no idea which one were you using next it was Chrome right first I was using Chrome but I never had problem with chrome before right um and let me just if I try to do a private session in Chrome yeah Incognito and then executive yourself first right this is like a practice okay wow that's sweet is it working in Incognito or no wait what happened here so I want do you know these um let's start recording this first let's start recording this stuff recording is on okay um oh everyone we are not practicing but wow okay I need bro because this my sound should stop coming in my normal Google uh why because I don't have I guess my um why I don't hear you yeah because I have wow let me try one thing no yes in person no I don't hear you but I don't get it I don't give a why okay it's like a filter um or like a sandwich yeah for me it's different you're on the one side and I I have the a third of the screen I don't like um why GNC bill has no wait how do I add music screenshot I send you the payments oh cool oh interesting it's very different I didn't expect that wait that doesn't work yeah now I'm playing with this Dragon Ball Z you remember a little bit I mean I didn't watch the full thing but yeah there was something [Laughter] so I can become like a super sagitting forward whatever is oh my gosh but for me you're in the same orientation you just doubled yeah wow because it's just nearest for your computer right right okay let's collect this because yeah no I can't figure out why this noun is echoing but now it's but it goes because you muted one of them so it's fine I think voice but I found it more or less knowing than this wait this wow okay this is a  practice going on okay yeah let's go like this yes so do you have your new Macbook Air yes this is my new Macbook Air and oh I'm trying uh recording the OBS right now because yes no not yesterday the day before I did a workshop I messed up something so it was not recorded so but you are using your computer like a number I picked it up there wow so did you where did you put it because I needed a US keyboard and so like China did they send it to you from China no no but uh basically you order online and it takes some time you know if you if it's like a normal one like no customization then you can pick it up anytime at a Apple Store but if you want to have us keyboard or your phone like upgrade on the storage and stuff yeah then you have to yeah you have to wait for like two weeks or something yeah that's what I was telling you it comes from doing I don't know if how it works I mean maybe if they change Outlook I don't think so like this this specific customization they send China okay maybe then it's that's it yeah so because I always miss my delivery a few times like yeah oh oh yeah and then when I ordered it was like too late to pick it up so I decided to ship it to Hamburg so I could pick it up there and do the workshop wow will be so stressed doing that this kind of things will drive me crazy yeah so there was no problem yeah so it's all good and I did a workshop but it was not recorded I recorded with my little camera so there is some kind of documentation like the camera with a massive storage I mean like the camera the multiplies the storage what like the camera that you use when we are in person yeah exactly they augmented storage the big files the Big File big ad file camera exactly that's such a contradiction such a small camera with such a huge file size exactly so because we did like a small practice during the workshop and uh yeah I recorded it was nice actually like we did like really like simple things with like webcam with a Hydra and adding colors saturation and some people didn't know anything about like some of it these people have no really idea of coding exactly how was that well so the the way I framed it is like I just prepared everything so that the like people like that can just play with it you know just change numbers and yeah do something because if they know coding already I think they can just do like learn by themselves if I give the material right actually you don't need to know so much you just need to be afraid to break the code yeah it's just like they can find all these documentations and you just I just have to give the pointers and so I'm gonna snap I mean so cold so yeah yeah so it was good and uh in the end like we were like a lot of people are asking about like audio reactive stuff this is this is a nice topic that maybe we should after you finish that we should come back and because I was talking with some people it must be nice imposing on this idea of actually uh somebody was telling this from The Sound point of view like the point that was the type with maximum fee and sound and interaction sensors and so on and 2010s [Music] um and now there is more advanced technology very surfacing play and that was my researching with archives and bushing Bank also I saw the same around 2000 10 something really high 15s now we are with more technology but it's not really cool I mean it's it's not really going it's a really nice thing that we were talking true I mean no no you said it so I want to like respond but like my take is like it hasn't changed in a way but I think what's changed is like we have more tools now so and you don't need like crazy setup but that's yeah I think that's what I maybe would be interesting I guess to will be interesting maybe to take a note of this but yeah I will never really when I'm gonna go back to this chat I think what is interesting here to mention in this is that was my my conclusion in my own Research In Motion tank is that it was interesting back then because they were not such a I mean say the whole thing about motion capture was not there so people have to be creative uh in the ways they were creating this motion capture gestures um but now that we have technology and this motion capture let's say is there it's just a straightforward one-to-one replications of projects there's not too much really explorations uh on this um so well I think with the point that I'm trying to make here that I am my conclusion on this or my assumption is that for more critique or an awkward question is that so back then since the technology was so narrow it demand that a really Niche group have to develop or have to be called heavy yeah to work with these Frameworks right so it's natural then it will be a small the group but nowadays we have Frameworks ready to use technology is cheaper consumer uh is so one good thing that it should allow for more practitioners to start using this then it should become bigger but then what I see oh it's that it's just in the same spot in terms of like practice you mean in terms of I don't know I mean I think what I was going to say that we have something wrong because I don't really know about the numbers are not the last survey is in terms of users comparing whole world and the amount of people playing with these tools and now it seems to me that there is there is not so many people but perhaps I'm wrong yeah I see yeah I mean I think that's also like a related like visibility like who's using this because there must be like people who are not who are like taking technology and using it which is good but also like not really like exposed to that like Community where we are in because we're I mean I don't know how to say it um but maybe like I want to like share like experience from the the thing in Hamburg um maybe I don't explain what framework I was in but basically I had the chance to work with like artists in Hamburg there are three artists and one of them at least she was um like she's like working with like image like collage and like her body um and um I had this idea uh what if we just like put them together like do something we had to make something quick so I just like bring like Hydra or like web experiments I've been doing and just put her contents in there and that already was interesting like basically what we had in the end is like showing a video in the background what she recorded in the past and put text that was like you know transitioning every second or like every two seconds that is like a writing from her so it's like like technically it's like super simple but because I've been working with this web stuff already like recording has stopped oh by the way you are both muted so you have to open one of them at least so hey it's it's safe it's the idea oh man I think it's just I think what it happened is that I download it to a new browser because I want to use their artificial intelligence new from Edge from Microsoft NET okay um I don't think as that was yesterday and now I'm is doing weird stuff please stop okay so let's hope my OBS is working fine recording is on yeah okay hello hey it sounds better this is making no sense at all when I start recording it sounds better oh for Miami I think it's my speakers um I have no idea yeah so you were you were saying uh in the tools yeah like basically like I just bring in like the web front-end things that I've been working and just put her contents and then that's already something new right like texts and videos I think that's like I mean that's very simple example but I think that's like already something you know because everyone has different experiences different material and we can be she was also working with like face uh like augmented uh intestine on the face and stuff with Jeremy Jeremy Bailey he's doing like AR stuff for decades and uh yeah I mean most famous artists the famous New Media artists maybe the artist exactly so yeah I I see the potential there like it doesn't have to be like technically new but more accessible like to become more accessible and then they can just feed in like whatever contents they have and then that's already something new yeah so then then the focus will be more in because I think the problem that we have or I mean as people who are somehow with some experience uh so we are not new in it in a way um then if to know I mean to be careful to use this idea of the Europe uh because this idea of the new innovation it comes with I mean uh this weight on Capital and labor and production and visibility uh so once before so what I like I'm going to use that is and they're trying to undermine you that the focus should not be and what is what is new technology there because they will be constantly something new and you will be stressed in getting to know how to work with technology but I think this idea of maybe like new Frameworks where you can basically new ontology like it's an ontological exploration that is at the constant state of reconfiguration based on uh custom-made Frameworks yeah they like for instance in that case you were the mentor so you understand what the person is doing already because everybody has experience everybody has their own practice uh so then you perhaps suggest something that is easy to blend into yeah yeah and I think it has to like happen in like different levels like this was like really how to say like intimate like you know the idea was like we have three actually we had four mentors and three artists so they work like one-on-one so they can like really give like direct feedback to what they're doing and you know create something but then like also like for example I was thinking about p5.js which is like it's not a new technology in a sense of like bringing something like technically well I don't know what's technically new but what the contribution is like a community right and the documentation so that if anyone wants to do something with web if they find it out like the idea is that anyone can like start coding with p5.js and create something and uh and that's another example of like something that is new in a ontological way that you said um yeah yeah it is a very good I mean it is I think it's very complicated anyway but complex because also it regulates signed to uh you know to take a matter so it's very complex um and I really demands time not necessarily in a linear fashion totally meaning yeah I mean let me just like traditionally learn process uh um the the beauty of this space is that we have no panels so we are building the cannons and things that is happening will be boring to just start falling back into our heteronormative wide model of knowledge which is linear and progressing but for that you need time basically and time yeah so yeah I sent you like you know my ranting or like like some messages before but basically that's like a like kind of for me like a take from this experience also like At first we were trying to do something quick which is good but then we forgot to you know give space to each other and then at one point we have to sit together and you know talk about you know what's the needs what are the concerns and then then from there we started like you know slowly share more insights you know and working together and that's again like we need time and care and you know giving spaces like acknowledging the needs but that doesn't collide with you know like doing something like creating something quick right it's just like we have to have like take proper steps to get there for creation what do you think was what like sorry I I couldn't catch it like what do you mean with proper steps purpose steps yeah like like really concrete is like code of conduct for example okay yeah I mean that's of course that's not enough it depends on the the context but yeah like to acknowledge that you know everyone needs the space everyone needs a lot of different needs um so again would you agree then to say that this refers I mean the space all the context like like sides of a group for example acknowledged yeah the snake you know like how diverse the group I mean everything can be diverse but you know like where people are coming from uh how many people are there and like framing this is also like very tricky you know you can't just like have diverse big group of people and do something doesn't work that way we have to you know I think how John framed this like she was creating this and we were like in the end like seven eight people I think that's like a good number of people to like work together if it's bigger I think it would have been a lot harder to organize so but you were you were in everybody mentors and practitioners so we were like originally like three mentors and three artists but uh Jeremy had to leave earlier for the the one you sent me the link using the video uh so I also jumped in and I'm also commenting John uh so we were like eight people okay and like artists like three artists they are um yeah they're different from different places like like based in Europe like Austria Germany I mean mostly in Hamburg but um wanted some Ukraine Iran Vietnam and um yeah this is like also like really challenging thing right that is like yeah how to accommodate everyone just that it's from different group places more time totally yeah to set the group to acknowledge individuals trying to find a common I mean yeah the yes all right yeah caring environment totally yeah and something I noticed that is that like if I feel uncomfortable in the group like I can sometimes address that or like I know who to talk to you know okay this like this is like uncomfortable like I'm I'm out or like you know I just feel not comfortable but that's something that I developed or like maybe it's my privilege to say that to be able to say or to be able to notice but not everyone can notice or like you know talk to someone like that because some people are like really uh caring or polite that you know they can't just address that just put it there I think it used to be to be honest like being more rough is the thing is a matter of privilege and recognition of privilege um without going deep into that it's just depends it depends I mean you grow up with certain privilege when you're traveling you can recognize your privilege the place that you are within the prices yeah but that doesn't mean that you cannot try things to clay more space on how I tried to find but uh you will be still uh not a German person in the German context um so yeah and also I shared that you know the the phrase that I really liked from you that you feel like domesticated I mean this was in the also in the Lost chat did you quote huh did you call it coffee or not because what quote because you said like did you use it I mean like I I said like I told to them that about uh you know like working with you and you know you said that okay yeah yeah I mean just briefly but basically the way I said it is you know like don't be oh not that don't be domesticated but you know if you have this uncomfortable like you know feeling that's also like very precious you know it's something that you shouldn't suppress that it should be somehow expressed or you know I mean it doesn't have to express to the public but some to someone you someone who's close or you know write it down I mean because that's something that has to develop in a way right yeah because also I think what it matters beginning to end up in any context is any conflict when you are not alone is that yeah you have to so then you have the context where you want to do something set in a way or not so I think this idea of what impact we will tackle uh we what we call accountability so if there is open events I don't know you have been there is a in one of these weird I mean this paper that almost yeah they are there anyway when you enter it says like and it's a phrase that basically you have any point you feel that you need to express something because you are not feeling good in any way so there are always people to reach on their opponents and sometimes I mean we try that at least one of them they're inside or it has to be a good connection with somebody who knows how history of his problems about and then the people use this and we have protocols operating with how to address different kind of accountability problems it helps not only the individual but it helps to come space so it's not only about the individual but it's about taking care of the state because the common space right yeah and I think it's it's good to have this you know hotline kind of like place where you can talk to and when I do make code of conduct um I try to mention that you know if there is something wrong you can of course you can talk to me but it but I always try to have someone else who they can talk to because I you know very specific type of person and maybe it's not comfortable to talk to me about to address that specific issue so for example in that case of Workshop you know John was there you know some people from the festival is there so if you feel uncomfortable I mean I I hope nothing happened during the workshop but um they can you know either talk to me or talk to someone else and I think that's that makes it a bit more fluid yeah but I think like I mean is because I think all of these are related with money again you know time money and then it also relates to calability it's scalability or it's scaling meaning Impala is something so it's big now it's huge there are many people then I also there is history so there is leverage there is documents there is not much thing going on but after this phase because that's always what I try to share with people about Bob is this complex space but at the end what it makes it unique from my take is that it's just a big house that's it I mean from there you can find different things we think but it's just a big space um so the scale that's what I mean scales you have space Oh at some point we were having these dogs out with Joe Joe because Joe runs a resident and it's very much in the spirit of love so there will be always around five people living in a house but is it I mean you cannot expect the same thing although it sounds really good uh with the same Theory because people are people and you just need sometimes to up and take your space but in a house you cannot disappear computer you disappearing without saying anything to somebody it might be rude in such a short space but that's that's what that's what you were saying at the end is like everybody should have agency to use like whatever um wow that doesn't do the drama I've been eaten without hacking the whole space and time so I think the scale so money uh at the end of your money on time it has to be a lot of difference um but that's a really important thing like you know that like this giving space so that they can leave if they want you know it's not like in a negative sense but like sometimes you need space and then you know and this happened in Hamburg as well like sometimes like you know it's it's more like you know after the week after the work until we want to hang out or not and then you know someone who leaves and that's okay right because it's not like I mean it's it's nice to you know have drink and talk but that's not uh if we work the following day then maybe you need to have some energy have some more you know have time to recover so it and it's really different for everyone so if everyone someone wants to have drink that's fine if other people want to leave also that's fine and you know just like yeah let's let giving space for everyone that's and that kind of like happened naturally for us and that was I think that was really good that has to be a lot with the person who is responsible because at the end like so Jan is proposing that so at the end like the final like like de facto accountable or police or institution in that moment is uh yeah yeah as an artist and often happens as an artist you are uh sensitive yeah you need uh yeah you need that space and you needed somebody in a way acknowledge you and take your time even if it's just five minutes in a DC environment like I sure would care that when we met in no 20 although I didn't know you heard and the festival was so busy um and I was a contingency that I ended up there at some point like one of the first games gave me like good minutes but she was really focused on me Josephine in the middle of a really chaotic so it wasn't until we have a coffee in an included space it was really social environment she you know like we're talking to her and then she didn't she was giving her attention for a few minutes and then she left and that I remember very much so that was this thing that I mentioned that I think is uh it's very um yeah I think it's important I see yeah I mean like this was really ambitious project like this one in Hamburg um if it were not Jan I wouldn't have be able to you know to make it I mean it's also the trust yes of course yeah it's true but wait maybe you should close this to the chat here and then we can just talk into the backstage so thanks for watching please like the video subscribe uh and post it I don't know which layout we will have fun or maybe there will be two versions of yours and mine yeah the layout okay okay so much for watching see you next time", "9Lc472ZDVk8": "to make sure everything's recorded but I did this I need to figure that okay hello hello what's up hired how is it going live it's going did you find something so I'm just like reading the contract oh cool but that's good news yeah good yeah yeah so we're in in Cologne no in vupatar but it's very spacious so okay that's good nice so is your brother already in Europe he should be no you told me yes he's taking the train right now from so you're gonna meet him today yeah nice finally good so when when can you move uh like 15th or something I think no I still have to figure out the logistics yeah yeah did you did you manage to to send application by post yeah who asked to send these applications to do a digital residence by post that's so absurd well if you haven't upload it I don't I would say nothing but uh no no I think it's it's just that they want my signature yeah okay I get it like in in I remember in Belgium when I did my internship with motion bank I remember that I was like uh yeah almost I was at the limit with the dates because they needed to have these signatures from the three from three stakeholders from the University from Florida so but in paper uh as well that was such a hassle because of the unresponsiveness of Florian yeah no I think uh these days like sometimes I see uh people using uh what's called digisign yeah platform but I guess you know if they don't have resource to set that up then they just ask for signature on paper yeah but we we use that also in for because for always that has been always an annoying part of being one of the shareholders of puff is that because every meeting and is really important for part of the meeting for the year because we allocate resources uh every year we need to have Quorum which is half plus one to take decisions otherwise it's illegal and you have to uh propose a new thing because every year we show thanks to the lawyers who represent us as one as the as they say say and so that's uh has been since the beginning a painting they asked because especially I guess I mean for me it is it's difficult to survive winter so it's a period where normally I'm down and withdraw so I don't need I don't want to answer to nobody nothing and they so say we start with this in 2017. and they needed this kind of important you need the signature and then sending so it is a yeah it is energy that you don't want to put in that right and then you don't do it then they start like doing buffer-like stuff and then just finding their way to get you which I understand because it is is not only used like yeah it's 50 it's Puff and so it's important and I'm sure like because always at the end I mean I respond and that was early in the beginning like now we do with this uh this thing that you're mentioning Co is called digisign did you sign I think yeah yeah but before I'm pretty sure like there was you know that Martin is one of the people that I have never seen in one of the of the meetings I also I mean I have to be honest I have been only but it's called toku sign doku sign wow but yeah but that's actually that's way better than them because I think they start with these three years ago so because normally I'm I'm I mean I start sensing in my body when it's time for them to start searching me because every year it feels like that's I mean I know it you know like in the back you know with your own stuff like it will happen at some point like somebody will reach you in some way uh but then at some point then it happens I think three years ago that was just doing this procedure and what it was quite straightforward so that makes but anyway it takes it takes time I have to say that it takes time so what I'm saying is that is that if I'm somebody who's used to work with technology and it stresses me out like to allocate some little time to do something that I opt to be part of it I can imagine to other people who have no relation to technology and they don't want to have relation to technology I can imagine that could be very annoying and then maybe perhaps they would like to send a signature by post yeah more well I mean in Japan it's very strict sometimes the paper signature well they stamp but uh yeah it has to be physical are they stamped okay so you guys have like you just stamp every I mean you have a stamp or you or you signed uh nowadays I think there are some places you can sign but basically you have to stop so you need to then to make this stamp somewhere right so they're like two kinds like one is like cheap one that you can buy it anywhere so it doesn't make sense you know you can be yeah okay and then there's another kind that is more unique I think and that one you have to like it has to be like registered and they will check whether you're using the the one that you've registered okay yeah yeah yeah what's up what's up what's up how is it going but like this I mean when are you doing this um worship in uh yeah that's uh two three weeks like yeah three weeks I'll be there for like like a week a bit less than a week and give me Workshop I I'm supposed to do like mentoring I don't know what it is but I remember someone and then the workshop nice mentoring so I've entered you too yes yes it's true it helped it helped I have to say it helped yeah I mean no actually you mentored me too yeah yeah that helps yeah but but mentorship was quite clear I think your mentorship sucks my mentorship was quite clear I was there really focused to doing something specific [Laughter] like hired as a mentor to to be a Mentor no I think your mentorship has been I mean that's part of also how we deal here is like you uh we are doing this and the thing is more from my side I guess comes this uh where this um contemporary dance Workshop where like I start going deep into my problems with you like this is this like sometimes psychologists like so in that I think that's the mentorship that I think your mentorship is still is going on in that sense but is it like a group therapy or what I mean is is but I guess it's a group therapy in the multiplicity that we are because it is in so many different spaces and times and personas because we change so much depending of what we do uh and the good thing is like that we are comfortable in in whatever space that we are so physical or digital that's why when because say for instance we were hanging out for a while since we met in in Amsterdam so that was quite some days so and and it will be managed to leave so I was surprised I was thinking also that it's just uh like a bit more than the week but less than 10 days I met we met on Friday no it was it was a week actually because we left both we left on Friday on Friday yes it was week yeah so it was a week um it was a week I think week is okay like oh maybe 10 days is okay and then if it takes two weeks it's good to do this I think it depends on the space I think it depends on the space and Depends of I think depends of say for instance in buff is fine I think that will be interesting also to me to see like in puff is fine in a place like puff is fine if we don't have something concrete I don't think for more than two weeks because then after it can become I guess better or worse but my experience is tough just alone just alone is and I have to spoke with this with Danny and other people I think two weeks is like a good time to be in puff but after two weeks like then it's a bit it's a bit is you start getting into some I mean time it just changes a lot and somehow um yeah I mean life is not like a life is happens in bath for good and wrong papa is a beautiful space for that because it's a very safe space but at the same time it's very intense um so there you go then after two weeks I think personally I think there is a strong to be there um but uh so that's what I when I came back I was having this idea that let's say for I was when I was mentioning about workshops of new branches then I felt like is it I was just more thinking that next time they would go to path or we have used to find more like the time like to put it in a calendar so that we know to do our residence then we then we just we know that we are working in one or two a few aspects um like this time we just went there because there was this um actually this is the third time you have been there the first time you was there I mean it was invite what was the first time that you went there it was after Hamburg no it was after like we were in Essen afternoon now yeah but I went back home and you went to cologne and we met there no no we went I stay at your place afternoon now you came here yeah yeah okay and then we had that uh non-existing train surprised um yeah so but then the first time we were there and we were working on on the performance anyway right that time we were focused that was actually I mean like the month or two before yeah that was yeah that was like the 2021 that was quite busy for us like with a lot of things with this practices uh so then we wanted to check the performance the hybrid performance we work on that um um but we didn't really work on that like we did practices but I think but not we were I mean we did no we did work on the hybrid performance like I think we have we have three sessions two of those we have three sessions which is and you were there for a week also you know so that's a lot and this or sessions were like two hours at least right so in in a place like password you know that you have to walk in from your room to the kitchen can take you 10 minutes and also you can get meet somebody and you never arrive in the kitchen that happened though uh because the house is so big so then so I think so anyway we I think we were working we we work on that then the second time you came there it was oh it was basically the case Theory so right after Hamburg that was after hammer with all this shitty thing of trains and things there is always such a thing with puff like I'm fed up with that like because because that was so funny because you were fed up with that and you took the flight which was canceled like two twice or three times yes that's true that's true because I arriving going to Hamburg great yeah I was supposed to be there in 11 hours and it took me like 17 hours to arrive there it's crazy yeah so we had to reschedule because of that that was a lot I had true and um so I have a certain this chaos theory then then we did um a workshop because we came from Hamburg to present in a workshop so we always like so the first time we were in Bath and then we share we shared this hybrid performance it was because we performed in in the impulse dance uh and now and then the in September we give a workshop because we share a workshop in Hamburg and it just came I mean we did we did not plan this now it just happens organically yeah yeah yeah yeah so and this time just we came after the Symposium of uh of Lima of digital art preservation right and then we did a cooking um yes and then we did the um this time ah so this time in path we did cooking with cooking buff ER we live stream cooking live stream cooking yeah yes I told Danny and Danny was like yeah because I saw Danny we went to a party uh where I saw Daniel this guy from the Queenstown Festival oh yeah um and I saw all these people from yeah Bojana all these people from from this field and all these like I'm one of the The Young Ones but what yeah I want to say it oh did I just saw Daniel and I remember wait yes I remember because I was a bit drunk and I high a little bit I remember so I saw Daniel came to say hello and then I was I think I started almost a bitching my my research about br its because also before then I mean that week I I mean I now that I have news that I will do for five months this thing at Academy and I can relax a bit but before already I told you I was like with my my money was getting really low so I was getting how thinking how to make it yeah how to keep on researching on this um so then I saw Daniel and I think automatically I was pitching that and then Daniel listened anyway but because then because Daniel's the director of the Queenstown festival and then but then he said like oh yeah but I reply you something like I remember when I did this uh at some point I sent an email that I think I sent it to you and to I send an email uh before publishing that igf haven't published The Articles so I send it to three three different networks one was like dance and Technology Network other one was like seeds another one was like art Indian like python art like Performing Arts um and I remember like almost nobody answered I mean like if like uh which I was expecting anyway that you send like and I mean you will know who will send something so even even if they cannot answer you know they will say like I cannot answer did not I mean David said like yeah I cannot do it um that's nice you check uh Danny also she said like she cannot um she she said that she will read it but she did not but she replied that was nice um and she remembered like because the last time I saw her in Hamburg I forgot that I sent her that and the first thing that she said to me is like oh my God I haven't read your papers she remembered that I didn't remember what was that about I remember that I was like what like the night that we were drinking like they're having these cocktails that you get so wasted oh that's so extreme the Auto One it gets drunk It's So extreme man like you're so extreme like I got because I know you're ready like um but you're physically the way who you express is so what I consider I guess could be cultural is just so like like what I seen away from I guess like my stereotypes of of Asian people or like Japanese TV like you get really like physically doing some movement like you will not do an answer your sound your laugh it's like people are a bit like yeah that happens when you are I mean I guess like everybody when it's wrong to the other the old their own stuff but I this is just something that I was thinking that perhaps the school's role that yeah that you get into more Japanese modes to be you the when you're drunk I don't know uh but anyway so that day you drunk a lot of cocktails like what day was it that the date in Hamburg yeah yeah I think you drunk like five cocktails like I myself no not that much but I sell I drunk three cocktails and I think you went for maybe one or two more than me and that's a lot of cocktails for a night this Thursday I was just drinking like if you remember which one like when we went to the bar oh we were drinking at the camp Naga or like anyways it was it was in the in the bar and you go to the bar yeah yeah it was at the bar forgot and so actually I was just looking for it you know like I was thinking like did I actually reply to it I don't know or maybe I texted so maybe it's not the email I don't know but maybe you didn't reply to the email because it was just a generic email that I anyway I share with you but you re you did read that and we spoke of that differently yeah yeah and I understand what I found what I found is that you forward me the email from Italian so I have that oh yes oh yes when I when I found it in my email I I found that it was in forwarded yes yeah and he was like yeah yeah please put it because I think what he's saying is I was reflecting I think it's relevant for like yeah okay I write to you quick quickly the festival is starting in just some days and it was a bit rushing around I just wanted to write you back thanks for sharing this with me I read it this morning though it is not my field of expertise and it may it is maybe more difficult for me to write down comments in detail I found all of the research very interesting there is a strong balance for me between the intimacy of Storytelling in the form of a diary that goes on for weeks and the scientific form of the experiment in general the strength of strength for me lies in your making physical how one cannot separate experience from its analysis in this sense the ambivalence between live annotations and post annotations was particularly interesting to me precisely because it shows this adherence between the body and the image the movements and The annotation as if annotating is in itself a movement with you all the best with the future research and the paper it might come out of it and send you one street greetings that was great right I mean like now after all this conversation that we have is like so on point like yeah it was wonderful like one of the things that I was like thinking when I read was this idea that he underlined about the experience like you know like one of the first things that we will think like while while we reflect about Academia is like that you have to have the scientific Clinic approach while I'm trying to make efforts to make objective uh I'll try to make it understandable what you put out and then you go to those process of their peers and to review the paper basically um and then that was one one when we talked one of your proposals was like hey one of the ways who we can make this an articles was let's perhaps do an interview like do like uh kind of like an interview in order to make it pass as a paper um and it wasn't still in this idea of like trying to make it fit uh like make it a bit more liquid uh from within the framework uh of a paper and I was thinking that what he when he says that uh uh it was my email s so what what I was saying just now is about the form basically in the email already what I'm sharing I said that this is a paper in the form of a journal what I'm saying that is like I'm excusing myself like to call this a paper basically because it's being written in the form of a journal right and then he said this here uh I found the form of the search very interesting there's a strong balance between the intimacy of Storytelling in the form of a diary that goes on for weeks and the scientific form of the experiment in general the strength for me lies in you making visible hope one cannot separate the experience from its analysis and this is all what we have been talking in this framework in the chat when I when I'm sharing these ideas about complexity sciences and the the strength of the experience which is something that in the scientifical approach is this has been uh classically avoided like you always have to be objective like this personal experience doesn't count as yeah it has to go through the scientific procedures yeah and I think what he mentions is like something that touches like where you know like how one can um like find or establish a methodology to to kind of analyze or like uh to to think about this subjectivity because as he wrote like you know you can't really detach them right because you are the one doing and then you are the one writing so it is over like you know interconnected intertwined and then but also that's as you said it's something valid valuable has to be documented and then like how like it's like more like a question that you're like you're proposing like how can we establish a methodology or like you know probably there is no one single methodology for this and then like how can we continue doing this basically but then this is what it brings us to our conversation about like a kind of documentation then because as you said like for me was the first like that was the first time that I was doing this and I think it was ignited just because I was emotion Bank uh it was I think yesterday I have a conversation with David and then uh one of the things that we were speaking was uh was uh talking about this basically that this um yeah the fact that now I I am in this place where I'm considering very much the idea of archiving and documenting as a what what in a way it's like the back end no not yeah like that could be technically but not I started seeing this idea of a back end also as a conceptual framework that helps to understand to some things so um yeah I think so this to start thinking about this processes was because I was doing my internship there and although nobody helped me because we were like this is an inside joke that we have there uh that basically I was alone and only with like yeah but it was that's that's the way how they need to work because that's the way of the institution that institution works because the institution as is the other institutions that we saw they are three people four people a motion bank is that kind of Institutions so they cannot provide this kind of like a companion a companionment so if I had to Symposium like everyone was saying like how many people are working full-time in that Institution yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I talked yesterday also with that somebody the director from the it is Institute in Berlin in the morning and uh uh yeah and then she was the same thing like there are three people like literally like I don't know why there's these three people the person who represents the technical thing and somebody who does anything in between everything else yeah yeah and then of course they have their but what is interesting is like they have I think motion by them we can say that it's like we can analyze this and dismantle it like to understand also the other Frameworks like because motion Bank now what officially has is uh David which is the official representant of this Florian also is part of the research project and Anton uh which is like the deck guy there and other workers I think they still have like up to seven or eight people who are work who are paid I don't know like yeah between half time and full time which is kind of a big uh thing because they're handling different projects so um and they are so into rectangle with so many different things like yeah I just heard different things yesterday like they're doing also there will be a new CCL by the way and Colin cologne oh really uh in the days whereas Electronica is so I was like so I will see because it sounds like September is it uh wait this is in September application designers Electronica is six till the 10. from Wednesday six till the 10th of September um and I wanted to use already part of my budget electronica okay yeah so but yeah they were asking yeah so maybe I mean I I think I probably will do the CCL I guess um I still have to negotiate with them how I can get paid this time because then the first time was the GPU and then yeah so now I have to see how uh yeah yeah but this is I mean this uh this is part of this is public so this is this can be published also because this is known for like the people who knows us um yeah that's part like I was also reaching to some of the extended Network that I have met through motionbank like part of that is like digital uh dance digital um it's basically telling them yeah it's cool uh I do research for them and I can I'm as an associate but I don't get paid I need money to do the research um yeah so but yeah so what um what were we talking about archiving oh yeah wait I is like this thing like the the so I did so I wanted to announce it took me a while to find out what what the heck I was going to do motion back but then I find out and I well uh that I will start researching the VR I mean it took me I did a an internship about four months and the first month I didn't know what to do there was a CCL in Berlin then I came back to Brussels then we were working in some stuff virtually for a week and then I then I was giving artifacts to florium Based on data that he was giving me and basically different documentation Media Forum from the project of in between us and then I was proposing him some artifacts he was checking in that he was just often then I don't remember that yeah yeah he was telling me that he said yeah he would start like introducing this idea of like affordance and he was sharing these with me like yeah because he was very relaxed you know like yeah whatever you know like but just thinking what can what are these artifacts affording and that was something that it took me a while to to and I still I guess I'm still producing this kind of ideas um of affordance and then only and then I go to to there to the studio and I guess only after no I think from the first week at the end of the week he was asking me hey why don't you test the VR headset why don't you make it work with the and then I make it work with the designer and then from there I I start working on that um but what I'm saying is like then before that I guess from the beginning I was documenting like having in my head like because in my school they were asking me to have a journal also um so then I have to every day you have to form like they have this structured horrible Java platform that you have to put every day what you're doing and which skills are you using active passive and all these things and then so during that process then I was having also this document when I was like doing more of my reflections and at some point then I guess start getting more organic and then just the last two weeks I start working with these ideas of annotations and uh scores and we have one uh one chat uh in mind when you visit me when we were talking of this and I remember it was really late at nine and now and I guess I was the one with the plushie in the background there was some cow no yeah I just remember that yeah there was some cow I remember like a big cow or something yeah it's like from milk or something yes yeah that's the only thing I remember yes and then we were checking then the Pathfinder from MiO because I found that also from the files that they have um and then yeah then we have this this conversation really late at night again and then we we start talking about annotations and scores and then what was like and and then we were trying to find out what is like the difference between what are what are not I don't what are annotations like yeah yeah what are annotations and then we just uh yeah I was trying to fighting I guess I was trying to share what was in my head I guess what I thought it was clearing my head but then I'll so then you could not follow and then so we stay in that space for a while until we said you know what it's too late let's just close and then just we move on but I think that was one of the longest chat like we have two children I think it was like almost one hour and a half wow that was a long chat how do you even record that I'll check where it is uh I remember my child we should go I was at by chance I was just finding we have we have so much continent we have so much stuff there's so much material that we have that we just need to approach in certain ways um I just want also yes no it's just like one hour it's one hour okay but it felt like that and I think I was I was wearing this actually yeah you're very bluish normally anyway tracks but wait um do you have something to say about oh what the who's calling about connotations like that yeah no don't go there [Music] was what I don't know what next CCO fccl last night they were being calm it will be I think it will be in University of sports oh okay we know someone who's studying there yeah yeah yeah so I already I asked him do you know the maybe could be that she was pushing this foreign there are some people who wants to work with some VR stuff okay yeah I don't know like if well I mean I'm not saying me but like when it becomes really institutional then you know I don't know how to navigate through that because then it's more functional huh thank you people are doing this because the problem is so we I was talking yesterday without it is that so we have to do a CCL because it's part of the horse towns project four times four times in importance I mean that's the new I mean that's the 4.0 version of this network okay importance you saw it yeah I found it yeah uh yeah is is that the project that is used in artificial intelligence but it's basically just and you take a new take on uh Peacemaker um but it's yeah I mean I tried at Berlin and it has new new things that uh but at the same time then you lose the ability to put uh use uh online material like YouTube for instance okay because of the because of the content uh so they they Safeguard the way who they because it's uh because of um European laws of privacy um so the way how to make sure that they are not infringing any law is by not allowing you to use these URLs from YouTube for instance so then you have to upload videos uh uh so it changes completely the thing I mean just that I remember when he told me that just that thing I stopped when I heard like you cannot use YouTube videos okay thank you um yeah I have all my content is in YouTube uh yeah so um they have this project that is running until this until 2024. and the problem is that it was proposed to do uh CCL that was part of the project I see so it has to be done we think I mean it has to be done we think that framework but then we are trying to avoid to go in this hole that we I mean we experience this thing in Berlin when we have this CCL that it was we think the framework of an Institute of the institutional whatever was of the designing academies in Germany um and that was a disaster that was a disaster you can't imagine yeah there was there was this CCL in London close to London uh in summer that was apparently was great that was marked markdown when he was there like marcobee was there like the guy from Isadora was there like there were uh yeah there was it like the artifacts It produced is very interesting and the focus was again it was AI because that's what motion bank is right now um so now what we are is like we have to do this CCL in in Cologne uh so of course there are these Partners one is uh the school of dance and then then I guess from some people they heard people from your school and from the school of the sports also um then is we need to thinking how to make it work in a way that is interesting for us to do that I mean especially for somebody like me that I'm not being paid so I'm not gonna go I'm not gonna go with the hair if I don't have to if it's a horrible experience right so why am I gonna do that if it's bad I better be in art Electronica and use the money from the academy yeah right it makes no sense uh so yeah that's that's the place that we are and we have to see how to do it but you know yeah because you don't have to be there right because it's not like that's not mandatory for me because I'm not part of the payroll that's that's the way who I I I start reaching to some of these uh people that I have met through the network of motion man it's basically that that because I I live in Brussels and that they are there I can use uh and we are interested in and keep on working but I need to find the money basically to make it work yeah um yeah so but that's great because also if I would be an employee I also I was talking I was thinking of that like I think I wouldn't like to do that I wouldn't like to be an employee I'm like of motion Bank the motion tanker no I like no because then I then they now have to have uploading on my boss and already I have that as a mentor already have that experience for four months uh so I think like I really like my position and being free as you said like from the institutional framework yeah yeah and then also we are doing better conditions from both sides um yeah yeah but like if so there's like how to say it would be it would make sense if we can take something out of CCO right like I don't think I would be there to like make animations I don't know sorry I just because I guess like the the the reason why our schools involved is there's like people doing animations so okay I guess that's like a package I think like what I heard specifically that they're asking for you what I thought I could help is that um because I'm the one who has experience working with the order and motion band with that system um is that um is that they basically I mean from what they pitch to what what they teach to me is that they want to do a telematic performance I guess or start exploring the one person is in the VR in the in the motion capture system like doing whatever and then other persons experience that in VR and I mean and and then uh nuances in between this telematic performance I think that's the key thing uh which I'm very interested because anyway that's that would be my research in I will be researching how to share content that kind in in dormant so I'll be interested in and check what is it that they want I mean it could be also interesting it could be if for example if we can do a workshop but I don't know if that's that's really like not allowing aligning with what they do but somehow like if there's like any overlap of Interest because it doesn't have to be the way we did the workshop we could think about something else it could be also archive then it's more relevant yeah we have we have to see like because as I said like it's very blurry at this moment yeah I have to see how what is what will be they called out basically because from what I get from the conversation with David yesterday is that motion Bank don't want to do it that's what basically it is so true like David and and Florian which are both the ones who work the mic and not the most but the one who have to handle all these things um it's conscious Congress and he's just around and you don't have to deal with deal with the Practical things but I realized that when I was in mines like because still Mo people know motion back and when I talk in in Europe when I'm traveling and then I share emotion Bank people thinking it's called Nothing Florian like most of the people but and so when Scott goes to a place like dance Congress then he will be doing his stuff as professor uh but then we were working with Florian at the studio like yeah every day from nine to five I mean at the yeah in the in the studio like the motion capture place and stuff so why why why did you couldn't manage to go to the ma to dance Congress during in Europe right I was like presenting that uh I think at Dortmund that was the last week for you right well like last month so like last weeks yeah and then I also thought about like why I couldn't come to Berlin was because I was at the uh thanks anyway yeah I remember that one yeah because when I remember that when we were doing the application for uh Surat that I checked the Aya the because then I remember Ayah that was happening in Berlin you were not there but we met in Cologne I guess that was the time yeah yeah yeah exactly and yeah so wait so what uh what so what I got from that David is like motion Bank them wants to have anything of work load extra and that's clear because because motion bank is not getting paid and then I could include myself there because we are not getting paid for that so motion bank has to do that thing that's why it has to come up with the frame with the something that it works um and the easiest way to like make it work is through the institution that already their Partnership of of the network yeah um so we'll see we uh just just write in like if if there's something that I could do um like random Workshop that doesn't have to be good but more like a testing that I would be you know even if I'm not paid well I would love to be paid but uh if there's no money maybe I could do something but again that depends of like the the the framework they want to propose right okay do they want to do like a call out you know like I don't know what they want to do but even if it's with like the other university or like students yeah but I don't think it would be like through school I don't think it will be uh to the school uh I don't think there will be I think there might be some students they might be selected in some process I don't understand how but that's what I'm saying that uh because this has to go I guess pretty much through Florian like uh he's the one who needs to think I guess uh he I guess he would like to invite some people Florida is working nowadays very much about Ai and about adaptable greed systems what I share with you guys is kind of yeah yeah exactly like it so Advanced of these things so that's where there were the place where he is and I think he will be interested in sharing I guess there is some people getting that Knowledge from him uh through maybe through the university I'm not sure of this uh I mean yeah I'm sure there should be some people close to motion band if they are not people who are working there but it could be like Risk like researchers in Mainz University who are working on this idea of flexible grids with him and I think you want to take some of these researchers and then buy them there uh so I think he still one big part of the of CCL will be focused no I think I think the focus not big part the focus of the CCL again is AI as has been the previous in June and the one in Berlin also was AI because that's the where the money is coming from yeah yeah so we have to see like how Barbara I'll let you know anyway but that happens anyway so yeah let's see maybe we should start using AI I'd like to Quantum device to randomize like this is another conversation that we have to talk about not right now like there is do you know like the like did I tell you this like a the gtp3 was already banned in in Italy is what was it what do you mean like what's the story I like somewhere so the government of Italy's right wing like extreme right wing and as part of this intelligence uh intelligent government then they then they uh among things among things saying things like we are gonna we are going to Pro they banned already they ban uh meat produced in labs that's part of a campaign that the government is apparently doing on protecting Italian food like no no not protecting is like protecting Italian food from advanced technology advances okay and that's coming from the government like that wisdom uh seriously like uh so of course like yeah that's a populist government anyway so they're doing these kind of things and among this thing they just start saying like Okay no uh more use of chat in Italy so is illegal now and they are also planning to even prosecute if they check if they tested you're doing certain kind of things weird so like there is something going on like with seats like there's interesting threats of communication uh communication theories of uh about like people who started rambling when they heard these news because some people from the network are Italians so and then I couldn't believe it really I was at night and I was like that that's very I mean I just hope like if that's not the spreading in the whole European Union yeah I remember where I saw it that was like on the news on the like the board uh outside when I was walking like I saw that news I'm in Germany but it's just like you know this uh this gray weather and the people like you know the news about GPD is like so dystopians I like this photo yeah yeah yeah I get it sure yeah man yeah yeah yeah so yeah so there's an interesting um communication thread following that from the seats Network um I share also with you this link so they start sharing things um among those links there was one that I thought it was interesting that I shared with you this website where they basically have this the Future tools IO website it is curated tools or not creative maybe it's just like a database I just open it now and it's yeah I guess if the Future tools collects and organizes all the best maybe I just gonna share my my screen uh Chrome the best AI tools so can you see this can you see my screen I see myself yes okay so then Future tools collects and organize it all the best AI tools so you capital letters two can become superhuman AI detection for fun just for fun images scanning productivity text to speech that's basic that's the that's the main the whole Revolution thing aggregators gaming inspiration prompt guy it's interesting because this is about this right text to video interesting Avatar generative art marketing research translation chat generative code motion capture self-improvement video editing uh copywriting this is interesting I haven't I I have been willing to explore this Avenue but haven't uh the narrative video music social media video voice modulation and finance image Improvement podcasting wow speech to the to text free let's see if there are less premium GitHub Google call lab open source paid I want to see uh motion capture let's see what is this that seems like a Facebook promotion capture to create 3D animations okay 3D key frame animation Rococo studio is great have you tried this one but that's like the that you have to wear it no no this they have a they have a a studio so they have a framework for it's called Rococo Studio where you can uh products alley protocol video sorry it's quite good actually it's quite good and yeah because I I tested kind of yeah that's a mess like this is the kind of I hate things from Max I have other things to say about it but it works very well in Windows uh it's quite impressive to be honest like I really test like diagonals you know like uh yeah the places normally you will lose the the rigs and it's quite okay it's quite okay because it will use it will start getting your body and then estimate even if you are not in front it will estimate your body uh but the problem is okay of course is that it's not real time okay yeah so that's to create videos uh like a reading yeah reading just to use this in uh in blender or yeah yeah um teachable machine train a computer to recognize your own images sound on poses it's more like a like a tool for like creative mode it seems more like yeah like to manipulate your computer with gesture seems to me no it's more like uh you can teach it but then like you can use it for other purposes like it's not like contained in itself well in a way you can you know use that as a module for something else for p5.js or like yeah it says P5 JS wait let's check what it says by the way I don't hear a sound so it's a framework like yeah that's a website I guess where you can so like I think the idea originally was like it's a hassle to you know import this kind of thing directly in p5.js or other tools oh oh I hope you didn't miss like did you did you lost the recording I", "07jE7LgWQT4": "sure [Music] hello so we're back to well I'm not back and we're back to the digitals to be separate the digital space yes that's that's true in separate yeah just yeah I was there like a week ago oh yeah that was this was the room that you were staying sure it looks familiar I will open after this to [Music] um the hybrid document right right I already I sometimes I do I don't know when exactly I I start yeah I was there some time ago okay not too long ago um Barb 's practices and this is cool hybrid just this one yeah my hay fever has been really bad like I think from the day I was leaving puff it got it became really bad yeah and uh on the train because like well it was not horrible but almost already almost horrible let's say and yeah I've been taking medicine but you know like if you take this like kind of like how to say um it feels like it slows you down a lot yeah yeah yeah like yeah yeah for me like really yeah yeah like for me and everybody's different because for my for me there's only this Allegra tab works and everybody works differently on my body I know it works that brand I need to buy that yeah I I used to have that in Japan I don't know why I should try that what about this thing it was one idea that I want to put there that I'm gonna speak about right now but maybe just to introduce that is that's like so up there I did the art and Sciences they meet in the poetry which is actually yeah I will not go in there but it comes through this I'm I'm starting this uh things from Surat Atomic so now I'm in the fourth chapter out of 15. and it's very interesting uh how they build up uh okay um it's starting to start introducing this idea of complexity and then how say in a way poetry has emerging properties that aren't fall off to some uh yeah some degree and also signs fall off the sort of some degree um yeah I will come back to that but it is a very powerful uh sentence that they summarize like it's the art and the Sciences they meet at the point of the poetry I mean as actually the poiasis which is yeah yeah it's actually there um so it's a very powerful uh abstraction and I think on this we were speaking that I was underlying this idea of like abstracting things when we were there at puff some I was trying to share this idea of abstracting how what what was I saying that I don't do that boy please chill um in different ways in different with different words I guess I was trying to share this idea that it is in my head often now wow it's getting more uh clear the relevance of using outside analogies or abstraction also you can think about them in order to um try to put things together they are complicated uh by definition so trying to explain everything is very complicated um no oh okay boy is willing to play right now huh okay no please what are you doing she's a bit sick so I think she she wants attention she's being PL uh piano a little bit of blood I mean people blood so I think she wants some yeah I need some comfort ing busy yeah I'll do that please or I have to poop ah it's also because I'm using this wave and so she's a bit nervous yeah yeah of course she's looking at this you see this is my personal smoke machine um so yeah I think it makes Bowie a bit Restless because you get used to what the is that and put it out for now [Music] um so talking about the abstraction well yeah I mean I think you have a good example to say this like it I mean this is not my example it's Thomas example actually um what was it it was it was used for to use what ah yeah it was used it wasn't an abstraction or an analogy if you if you want I mean directly what it is is an analogy but you will categorize within what is an analogy uh to demonstrate what I see as an abstraction of an idea so the point was made within the uh we were talking about institutions and how toxic they could be and so on uh Thomas is somebody who supports dog or post doc of postdoc I don't know like that's like really an Academia this thing um so he really uh but the heart he's a musician he's a street musician which is yeah it's not only musician but he really goes into something that is very particular in Chile called Pena which I don't understand completely but the main idea of the penaas which is like a is a gathering that happens from time to time uh as it happened uh in medivh times uh with with uh who Gladys what is the name of who glad is this it musicians that were eating around between cities in the Middle East times okay jugglers I think that's called the thing that's named Jewelers that is Spanish I know minstrels well I never heard of that word before jugular have you ever heard that word before means Thrills no wow who glad it's anyway it's like is this musician they are these figures of musicians lagging in in mediev times then you have these musicians who go from time to town and they bring all these things under this kind of like some kind of situation happens in the town and then whatever and then they go to next town and so on so it's very much the same idea somehow Pena we think uh through American context and Chile I guess I wouldn't dare to say more than that because I don't even I don't really get what it is but it is really some kind of like a post Colonial expression of a Spanish uh thing the musical is very Spanish although somebody from Chile will hear this it will be really angry but it sounds very Spanish to me um so but anyway so because we think that context of being an institution understanding that so that Thomas somebody who is really at the core as street musician but also a serious researcher and Mathematics and Computer Sciences so then he was using an analogy he was saying that if you if you lost your keys in a big room and there is just one only one spot of light like the the first place that you will look and I mean and you have to go and take a train because you have just five minutes to go like the first place that you will look in an empty room is the spot where the light it is because I understand right it's just logic you just go and search where the light is um and so you will start from there because you have more chances to find the keys right so and that was like an analogy to say like institutions I mean institutions can be a spotlight on places where you have uh so you can start from an institution but it doesn't mean that you have to stay there but it's just a spotlight it just uh he was the thing using the analogy to say like it's a tool basically you have more chances I remember exactly what was the context she lives in the neighborhood where it's full of prostitutes in Brussels so and she's she's in because she has this this horse she wants to help them somehow to engage with them with art and stuff and she's not having any answers from them and sometimes actually they get out and uh angry at her right uh so then we enter into discussions and then Thomas was saying like perhaps you should go through the institution around that place okay and the whole point was an analogy so they hope what I'm trying to mention here is not to say it's good or bad it's just an analogy that really serve for us to like say ah okay yeah in in a way it served it's not that an absolute answer but it just facilitate things does it mean that if you're trying to find your keys you cannot just go start from the places they are not light but the chance it will take you more time until you find your keys um and and that was like I mean I'm saying this in regards to an abstraction of an idea the whole thing was about an Elena trying to collaborate with our health prostitutes or sexual workers I wouldn't call them prostitutes um um yeah it was it's something that it stays in my head like ah yeah it um there are things that more complicated so there are things that are complex in their nature and a way how you can go actually in a language that are actually in is more understandable and more inclusive is like through finding analogies um of complex ideas okay right that's something ah where should I start no but like I think it really depends on the yeah what you want to describe like something from classical physics I think that's enough and then I don't know it's just like one specific thing like hits me is like people try to understand for example uh quantum mechanics or for example like the chaos theory that we studied learned last year like that's something it's like sometimes it's very hard to understand with analogy or like it's actually the analogies can be misleading and that's the whole point because you have to understand like a whole different system in a way and that's the interesting part of it it's not about like you know try to get the gist of it through analogies but you have to understand you have to create a new world from your way in yourself that's also interesting part of science which is you know there's pros and cons like it's interesting because it's like it opens up to like whole new world whole new dimension in a way but at the same time it's just like hard to grasp because we can't just like make an analogy with a classical physics or what is around us I just want to say that yeah I mean I will disagree with what you're saying actually and that's but I think that's more according to the current state of Sciences or this idea of like complex Sciences um because it's the op in a way like this is still is classical it's in a classical app I know from where it comes your idea but I think it still is a a classical approach through I mean is a classical perspective in terms of categorization and understanding of things so [Music] um so if the point is I think there are two different things like one is like how much do you need to really understand something you know for what you need that knowledge so if your point is really grasp for real then Chaos Theory so telling an analogy for sure you will uh you will get uh I'm actually I'm not so sure of that I will still question that uh what I'm trying to make a point here is that I think the current state that we are uh this this new Renaissance that people are speaking uh in in arts in plural and Sciences uh this is all about and non-absolute truths and it's more about like open-ended Frameworks where of course all of them is not about like you start coming up with new ideas from like nonsense and and just like forget all what is being written in history and all the I mean for the place that we are but it's it's actually is just at this course that is more inclusive so then then again again depends what is what is that you need from that knowledge if you need to have like a specific if you need to have some specific information from uh Chaos Theory you might need to have more information uh and buddy what you need is some kind of like a vast understanding for something uh to go somewhere else an analogy might be just enough to for you to grab something perhaps yeah but what what you said doesn't contradict with what I said but uh yeah because I mean but I think yeah I should say this that um what is very important is that like not assuming I think that's the point I want to make like you can grasp it the the overview or like through maybe not through understanding cluster itself but maybe like how Chaos Theory can be used that can be you know understandable analogy but then don't but then you cannot assume that you are actually understanding the whole Theory and that's like really you know um something precarious because also this complex science idea like I always go back to like Neuroscience for example and that's like exactly it's about not assuming like people try to understand in a classical Neuroscience for example there are cells that recognize faces but it's you know there's something questionable because yeah we can't make that kind of simple like um yeah we can't simplify that way like everyone has different brains and that's like where it comes to like with complex science that you know we can't just like generalize something and we have to in a way study individual brains to understand that so that but that's like what I want to say is like that's about also I'm not assuming you know we can't assume that everyone has the same brain like this cell is responsible for this but you know everyone has different experiences and that's like yeah that's about what assuming and it's it's also about like science communication that's like something I heard like I don't know 10 years ago actually there is a Institution like science museum in Japan and they have this job title called science communicator it's basically their job is not just about like um how you say like researching but it's about like communicating how this for example like I don't know like internet works actually there's a nice installation a physical installation that shows like how like information is communicated to the server to browser and stuff so like the job of science Communicator is to yeah to tell about like how internet works for example to people who don't have um knowledge in computer science or engineering and that's really like beautiful uh uh yeah position and yeah it's so nice that they have they created that kind of like position as something valuable that's something meaningful yeah I mean something that is like thing especially when you're trying like when when you're trying to uh let's say try to go into this Avenue of knowledge somehow when you're trying to create knowledge I mean shareable knowledge right like so uh then the um using some words that the way who you use the words are important yeah totally yeah I mean that because that shortened paths in order to create I mean if the whole idea is to start speaking about something new you need start you need to establishing from where it comes already those ideas and and for that already have been people before you who have coining some terms that would be not so useful to start just renaming everything by yourself right right so it's really important this idea of uh of history or like especially like then understanding what is the history of art what is the history of Science of motor science or um uh in order to start I mean once you establish some ground then you kind of start in a way like proposing things like to play with Frameworks or being provocative in certainly in certain ways but um uh before some things are not clear I think you kind of stay I think then then you stay close to um I guess close to the work of one of the artists that in a way uh and the sense of the artist classically there are artists in will work on their own language so um wait do I want to go to that Avenue like I guess what I'm trying to share is like them this idea of the artist genius alone who just makes his work and it's in this Con constant thing but it's a long developing language the there is not such a thing like uh like in Sciences you are trying to do an objective uh investigation and research over certain topics and is an objective true for Humanity that it has certain methodologies and certain way how to go through while in art is basically I think considered as an artist like being working with art for almost 20 years and I share these ideas with you sometimes in relation to my position with seeds for instance that an artist a good artist needs to develop its own language so you need to go alone and basically just be autistic like and developing your own language so in that sense you are not being you're not being put a position per se an absolute truth in yeah or perhaps you're doing it but you are not constantly in this testing situation or this methodology there the scientists are uh the scientist the scientific method that you are forced to go into certain procedures and then to test your your doing to be valorate qualify yes or no through the community and then go back to your process the artistic worries like individual and then you have recognition not recognition grants or not but is is different so that was the difference I was trying to to make that uh that in the sense that um of the artists um right and what's our practices like where does it fall like I think I mean I have two things to say like one thing is like I think like and I like that very much it seems that we naturally we come through very much experience so uh I mean like just sharing our experiences which is very artistic in that sense uh sharing what we know and what are our questions and basically confirming each other and then onto her finding a language that was common and um and I will argue uh that we are getting so highly sophisticated in doing this that we can just cook and manage to do some out of it I was having a conversation yesterday with Nasim on this thing in the sense that that we saw this chance of cooking in puff and we just make up for I mean uh a sharing out of it I don't know how to categorize that but it was a practice it is it is I mean it is the proof of what I'm trying to say at least in my thinking that is it's a showing of sophistication in what we're doing that we just we don't have to talk say even for instance at some moment there was like you got into this emotional space but we couldn't talk so then just a hug and then just trust and then you go back and then we just work because there was like 30 people to feed right yeah so it's because there is so much leverage that we can do these things like like I for instance when I arrived I I know when I arrive at the kitchen I knew I was a bit late so it was I I was I was thinking at the moment when I when I see it to start like or cooking or to start preparing something and then I decide without thinking too much I just start doing and then I trust it was fine also you know but it's like a it goes all in this I think it just all of these things are related to a complex situation because very complex um and then you go just with intuition that's the word that's your word just what your intuition what is what I what I feel in my guts it's gonna be fine and although all the possibility all the problems I see them what can go wrong how much time like there's so many factors uh people are feeling comfortable there's the kitchen so it's a common space like and at the end it's just like let's go and then just you start deploying deploying deploying and then just doing um and at the end so just things went okay and although for instance and even there was this moment that so that we need to to personally uh some kind of like rounded and you expressing how you feel we didn't have the app to really acknowledge that um but then somehow we did something and then we move on with the thing to give privilege for the collective right because the important thing in that sense and that's close to emergence uh then is like then important is that the we were working for a greater good it was not about or thing right uh right right but I think so so yeah no I yeah maybe you should finish because yeah I just want to say like where are you going what I said is that um so the thing that we start like from ex from uh sharing experiences and then confirming until developing a common language that I think we that's where we start doing and then start writing um then work came to us right and then different Frameworks they've got the branches and now what I think it seems to me is that we are having we are getting efficient in the way how we manage our times like uh I mean that's what I will speak about sophistication uh the just intrinsical sophistication in the sense of like there was so much things that I would that I I wanted to talk with you I guess or share in all those days but I was busy Euro busy and then we just find this Frameworks or in the chat or then or we perform so these are signs of like what I'm saying over like just getting effective and still like moving on what we think the is I guess around the practice you know [Music] but lipstick well so wait let me because I didn't close so um so this is facts what what I call of sophistication uh or abstraction this is what I would call abstractions or gestures on abstractions um then the place where I am interested and this personally me as Jorge and my ovres Jorge is I'm interested in that cross with art and Sciences and then how I can then start sharing and with other people and that's the place where I am right now okay right oops um yeah it's it's hard to say like so you said uh no efficient no effective like yeah effective could be yeah yeah the efficient sounds like you know capitalist thing but I think in French like yeah maybe maybe effective I like okay it's less it doesn't have it sounds less Capital although it is very yeah I think if in French it's the same same word isn't it because anyways but I mean like you know it's kind of like interchangeable you know in a sense but like not because we're going like completely different from like capitalistic sense of like efficiency or like scientific way of well I don't know what scientific efficiency actually is by definition is sufficient science like by definition like science trying to be just the shortest point the shortest time from point A to B there is not a sign they're trying to take more time by definition no but but but that's that's the thing like like that's the goal of science but the way like more like interested in like the methodology of science right and methodology of science is like highly inefficient in like whatever process I mean maybe yeah like whatever process because it's that's about it if it's efficient if you can find uh whatever theory in an efficient way then we don't need science because we probably discovered everything but because everything takes time and you have to try like 100 000 different things and then sometimes you accidentally find new I don't know like substance or whatever because of like by accident and that's that's like methodology in science it's like so inefficient well but effective like that's that's the thing like it's they're trying to you know try possible things and then find something new and in a sense that what what we do is like similar to like scientific methodology like we know that we take time for certain things but we know that it will lead to something this is interesting that's very interesting that and you're saying then if I understand you correct that science is I mean it's like that's an entry or something that you're saying is that science is inefficient but effective which I subscribe to that idea like like in general it can be yeah not always science can be inefficient but it is effective um and then how you relate this with the practice because we I well mostly like I think these days about care and they practice about care you know and that's like highly like well yeah effective way of like communicating or like making things right but if we cook yeah we need care about like each other and for the people for the space and that's what we prioritize it's not about like yeah like it's it's yeah that's that's it like we like how we communicate it was through care in a sense it's not about talking about um how to say I don't know how to say but but that's that's something I feel like the practice is about care about space about each other about other people and that's ultimate like efficient effective way of as a methodology I think I didn't I mean I got you I got like in a way like the input and like the outputs I mean I got like that you're saying like about the practice about care although I complete I don't I just don't like lately that work because it's being co-opted lately too much for capitalism so I started getting really cautious with that work like you start seeing with uh and startups and all these tech companies they're like then like young like people who are like I don't know like really young that they are with this they are I mean it's people who they have this um they are very healthy they are vegan they do yoga at the same time they're hyper capitalistic they so they are there are so much things that I don't know what are they but I I'm highly uh suspicious uh I can know more I can I can say more than that right now but that's that's uh so and they speak very much about care uh but I see but this is just this is just the I mean don't just say that because this is just some distractions like I will say yeah so there I got your point there so care and then so because the practice about care then it's efficient in relation to what you were saying before very sufficient um there is efficient or that is effective yeah how effective how effective in doing what and we have like hold it for the total situation maybe it's not the most efficient way to deliver food well I think a word like everybody I hear like the people who are amazed with the food there are what I'm saying is like not about that like what we cooked but like you know like maybe there are different ways to like communicate or not to communicate to make that happen within that three hours or like four hours of cooking but I think what the path we took was about like recognizing each other and and you know do the practice and that was like maybe not the most efficient way but it was effective okay as an experience like we both had like great experience the whole point before starting this project was that the people should be satisfied with the food and that was granted like the the whether they wouldn't have left I uh yeah so if like some people were asking me like about the Food Lion stuff they were very excited so people were very uh satisfied I was satisfied also with the food so then then it was effective yeah okay effective but I like this because then we can start almost thinking like in terms of like this is abstract these are abstractions that you're doing by the way like trying to create that's what I'm trying my head is trying to go is like into that logical space like almost like creating another an algorithm basically so that we Define what is care what is so what is the input what is the output and what is in between that's the place where I am right now I'm trying to when I'm when I think about this but it's yeah it so it comes from there so I just started thinking in these things lately um highly abstract but I'm thinking like that so like trying to like I try to understand it better like you're trying to for example like analyze how we did it like where it's coming from what I'm trying to wait to coin stuff like to reduce time for it like I'm trying to make things to to coin terms and trying to to so specifically for the words yeah yeah like um to to analyze this yeah so for like something that I like that you're saying is you said there is so you said that is that what we did was about care and it was effective for the total for those are my words for the total framework and I like this idea of total framework because in that case with kitchen cooking but it could be a performance it could be I don't know anything uh it still will be the approach the methodology will be the same with about would be about caring and trying to be effective uh right which is very like how can you be a fact say say with me so how can you how can we be effective to do something that you don't know that you have no experience before say like the kitchen like already we have at least one time we we cook so it cannot fall in that category you see what I mean like how can you be effective to something that you have never done before um I mean in this idea because I'm trying to almost like to coin and start like writing an algorithm of this like if it's true if it's true then uh yeah I'm uh don't yeah I'm trying to just to just to make this in an algorithm so okay we're talking about like some like so many different things now no like you're trying yes to coin make those terms and then what's what's with this like other situation for example we have to I don't know um do something new I don't know like what would be something realistic and something that is like unknown no but I think I know what is it the place that is like a bit confusing I think uh right now for me also say that so we know the and this is coming from the practice we know that we care right and so that they I will say like care is uh I would say almost like an entry point and then you see at the other side like a total framework of like the framework what is the framework that you're working so in that case with cooking right um then the way to so the methodology to use in a way could be like caring about the space um and as a consequence as a result then you're being effective because you care about because you care about that framework so quotation mark because you care about the cooking for the people then you're effective right this is on are we on the same line yeah and what I'm trying to say um then what it becomes really complicated then to start like understanding is like okay so what do you mean by being effective that's like the really question mark in that uh I see right because what's tricky about this is this idea of care or whatever that you would say is also a measure for the effectiveness because that's a big part of actually like how we saved effective or not as a person receiving food or whatever they see that like in this package it's not just about food but it's like this care there's some kind of blob is also added to it right is that you're saying that they would measure their experience not just about like if the foods taste good or not but it's about it's this care you know how many stars they would rate for care that's also part of it either way yeah it's exaggerating so if we say if effectiveness because Effectiveness is actually measured also by care so we're just saying that if we do it great then it's great if you care people receive care like so this doesn't actually make sense it's not really like um analytical yeah and then we have to talk about like so what is care and what we do what they receive then you know if we start to like talk about this more I mean I feel a little bit saturated so I think we could you know slowly do this process of like what because this is like all like this really complex thing right yeah about care also cultural and that's something we also like we talked about about that path um yeah it's it's very complex and it's not something that people can just like okay I care and then they can care you know it really depends on the context their experience and all these things right okay and maybe we should move to something else but I think I think the way we do it is like we just like think of like come back to this like once in a while because like it's not something you know right now we can solve it but I think we have to I mean we are actually working on it like this cooking was part of that process but this is what I'm telling you when I'm speaking about abstraction is because I'm doing this process in different things that I'm doing like I'm trying to to understand because then as then I kind of start seeing similarities between different Frameworks that's a process that I'm doing currently that one way in a way is like what we're doing in a way is like being deterministic you know what we start basically analyzing we started like doing a classical approach to how to understand these things although it's a contradiction I mean you see what I'm trying to my point here no actually that's also something I wanted to point out because like finding the right term is also about care because we have to be you know comfortable with that word and that depends on the context as well okay but yeah it depends but I don't know but then I think this has to be very much about yeah I don't know I wouldn't like uh maybe I would better move on the not say I don't know for me like then uh I don't know if I want to go there I mean not no but I I believe that this has to be something plastic like something changing negotiating all the time yeah absolutely it's not yeah yeah that's what I just want to say yeah okay we have some methods I put it in the hybrid that's um uh so what [Music] um is that thought we were talking before then oh yeah no but this is something that we do behind it maybe we can just close this chat here actually we don't have to yeah I think it's a good time good yes all right don't don't close the tab you have to finish the recording first yes yes yes thanks for watching thanks for watching next time we like the video a better one And subscribe to the channel yeah Jorge Channel stop recording", "_8QvIviC38w": "whatever is recording now yes it is yours what yeah those are more wet salt from the wok oh thank you for keeping my seat wet hmm electronics and water making it really kind of comfortable okay ah I need some air that's a good idea hold up it's like a fourth day I mean like excluding the arriving 12 day this is the third day really it's just the third day yeah because we arrive on Monday yeah it's super short yeah that's why it's just super short yeah I realized that of course this is the third day no yeah of course I know it's super short demands a lot of energy right now my idea was to come here to rest actually [Laughter] and I cannot sleep also so that's been difficult it's my third night that I sleep no wait first night I sleep I guess four hours second night seven hours that was good and today four hours out so but I compensate like with one hour meditation from time to time at some point when I cannot sleep I just like woke up and then I just stayed because basically I'm meditating while I cannot sleep so I'm trying to focus on my breathing so I end up meditating so then at some point I'm just like okay you know just see it I mean I just in that way I recharge some energy but I need to do these things through the day yeah otherwise happen and as it doesn't work that much but I mean it's it's it's a thin line between coffee and verbena Camilla because too much coffee also I mean I could be awake that I need to be awake but my nervous system has to stay in Balance because I could be awake but I also like not feeling good at all let me see like deprivation of a sleeve too much coffee is no good I think no especially in social environment it can become very socially distressed and as you experience buff can be very just like in a rest when you are in in yeah I'm not affected by let's say lack of sleep or very sometimes it Demands a lot of social thing I see yeah well here we are this is the number three if you upload it did you upload the last one yeah this is yeah and this is three okay good it's like you know after Christ afterwards now my my era is over you're born and we count from the from the beginning anyways so we're gonna cook yes let's see how it's gonna go well we talk about it later between us well we just have to write down yeah but also like that is here for sharing is that we something's gonna happen yeah true something's gonna happen so and some people already asked me like there's some people who are curious I don't know if some people have asked you yeah yeah some people have asked me so um yeah curious what happened something's gonna happen something and a part of like yeah this you have this practical thing is you have to feed 22 people I mean that's the the focus is that is to make food for 22 people but then we think that what that framework uh affords so what can happen within the concentrate without what happened uh uh while cooking for 22 people what can happen yeah yes so I I really wanted to ask you like so how was the performance you watched the the performance I did I think it was entertaining entertaining as I said to you yeah um that doesn't mean that it's good or bad it's just it has this I will put it in this category is was amusing almost like a stand-up comedy yeah yeah um yeah like I guess it is in a personal level I guess the yeah it says so many things to me that I guess so maybe some other people might not connect that much because that would be my experience so I don't know if it's so relevant for me to speak about those things I mean a part of like in different I guess in different layers I will summarize that it's just for me it means so much that you have been there and then you experience this things that you were sharing because I come from that place right so then I don't have to yeah yeah like the idiosyncrasies like the culture is there um so yeah but so then this uh when uh yeah so maybe something that it was relevant is like this thing of um what would you maybe describe for them like what what I mean what was your I think you you said yesterday about how would you describe what you did yeah I'll try to like also take your time like you're describe so basically I I was doing the exchange for four months from August to November and at the end of November I did the performance which was like so what you saw like part of it what came from that performance so it's not like I started from scratch just to give him I have because before he did this performance in La nacho right exactly yeah I just started this yeah I didn't saw that one no I mean that's uh that one so there's a lot of like similarity and difference in the way that the creation wise like that one I really like did rehearse like rehearse a lot like the one that you present the last one because last one I didn't really didn't have time like yeah like the place was confirmed like a week before the festival or something it was really crazy um because I wrote to like many places and like nobody answered or they were like you know not really responsive and it was really tough but that place uh actually I knew I got to know the place through the light coding people because they did their performance there okay it was a ideal for projection and stuff actually but anyways they did something there and then I was like okay that's also like close to where I was like staying in Japanese so okay give it a try and they're like super nice people and yeah it happened and this but the thing was like so I had like one week to prepare basically or 10 days and I had like three days of rehearsing like three hours each and basically I made that performance in that time frame and at the natural we had like weekly laboratory where we show work in progress so I had more time to you know do it and then like one week like through like one week before the performance or the showing I was yeah like almost every day I was doing like a little run through and every time it's like kind of like structured improvisation so yeah I don't write it and it's different I mean that time I was really like trying with like different formats and then in the end I decided something very specific which I have it on my channel actually but did a talk through because the one thing was that that performance the video recording was okay I had like 4K camcorder like really good but I didn't record the sound I mean from the camera and yeah you can't really hear me far away yeah yeah yeah that's why like in the the one at the theater here in the last one I tried they did with like Zoom recorder and it was like okay it's not like the best but you could distinguish you know the noise and the the talk yeah yeah yeah much better yeah yeah yeah yeah so that's kind of like the background and then yeah like and then what happened then then literally what would you describe then your performance yeah so I want to do it long because you know I invite people to see this so I wanted didn't want to do okay like 15 minutes that's that's like you know and yeah yeah how long was the the natural uh 30 minutes okay I mean a bit less but the thing was at natural is that the idea was like I start from reverse like I do this like Japanese dance that's the kind of climax but I started questioning you know like why do I need to do the climax at the end so I started okay I start from that and then I go to warm up and then like describe like walking back to home that's that's also in the part of the performance I did like like walking from the school I'd walk into the school basically in the city okay to the to the campus and then the natural like I'm walking around in natural anyways okay okay yeah okay I see yeah yeah and then now that you're saying like ah okay that bubble you're doing yeah exactly it's the kind of things that I was saying like it's just in your head like like I know now so like I don't see that like what are you doing like it seems like you are a really uh not talented mine yeah I mean yeah like also like so anyways like uh I don't know we just jumped around but uh yeah and I just said like okay I just be myself yeah if I wanted to say that that thing was good yeah yeah because if I I just be myself talk about my life and it's also like not like you know it doesn't have to be like everything is conveyed yeah like clearly yeah then you just have to read something about me and I mean that's also part of the work because I did okay I this time finally I broke my cards just like also like I didn't say it but uh these cards like that I made well which was actually the website like that really helped me like constructing the performance because that's your life basically like yeah that's the memories and then in your life yeah yeah like and why are these cars not in the Box oh because I wanted to put soap in the Box because I ordered like three three of those uh like sets and then I was like okay just one one of them I wanted to keep it for the soap because I really like the the solid ones like shampoo bar thingy you know like not doing anything great then it's easy to travel because yeah of course way much and that box is like perfect so yeah now yeah and anyways I think that box doesn't really worked well because it doesn't fit yeah and at the design Museum you know like I saw like a lot of like products like that I was like okay now I think I have to think about like making those cartoon box for this anyways yeah so yeah like this was like not like directly like I was playing with the cars and like constructing the performance it's not like that someone asked me about it but it's not like that but it's more like yeah like making the process of this it's like the practice like embodied so I have like Memories but in a physical way and then when I think about the the story I just like you know okay I did this I did that like coming from yes yeah the memory of the memories yeah what I was thinking that I mean it just opens this question like when I was watching you know then of course then I cannot avoid to criticize you from my knowledge and like in in theater and dance um then there was something else that had happened with a friend of mine so for instance there are places like that where you can go on and study choreography directly so you don't have to study dance right and so there's a friend of mine that I did that project with him he's a Swiss American guy um a choreographer and he's a he's coming through from a drawing practice he's a like Fine Art no actually uh cartoons it's a very special illustration and cartoon specifically this but the humor is something really important on his work and then he go and study uh choreography at this place that sometimes have told you in Brussel there was uh that Danielle was the director of this place uh exact institution Arts choreographs I think he said Institute Superior Des Arts choreographies um uh when he dances he dances just really awkward and what is so it has been some texture that is unique uh that remember because then I was working in some projects specifically with him and I always he was also asking uh as an advice or like what do you think of this and then he was really training himself like then back then like taking ballet classes and he started studying dance I guess maybe when he was close to 30 seconds or yeah 25 or something like this yeah I would say more close to 30s and so I think he was uh trying to a part of the classes on choreography that they also follow some dance classes he was going really serious trying to take some uh training as a professional dancer okay um and of course he was struggling uh with time I guess in general time management time man yeah time in general yeah time I mean it is time can be you know timing sense of like choreographing something but time yeah in any sense because it's like I mean I don't want to enter in that abstraction it's just in time as he's all in any in any kind of time reference I think uh if it will it will it will work I think what I'm trying to said that it's just time was not working I guess in this idea of he becoming really good technically and becoming a dancer um then then but so then at some point we were talking of this like I mean I was encouraging him that that first leg I mean they need to negotiate with himself like this desire of becoming super good technically as an answer I'll also I mean he doesn't that doesn't mean that he needs to stop pursuing certain technique dance techniques but just to negotiate this desire and then for what it matters let's say for the public it's for with the audience see So objectively speaking uh he has a rich movement like objectively I could see like I could not do what he does like because I have some training so the way how he moves is it responds more to I'm talking about say 2000 2019 maybe 18 like I will certainly say that from uh his movement was certainly responding to what the state of the art of contemporary dance was that as a performer he was uh he had a body a performing body I will say that in myself I've been somebody with training I will say I was not I will doubt myself more my my knowledge limited limited my my agency and movement towards that idea of dance and choreography as an expanded practice and so I'm saying this in regards to your um your performance um all this technical all this technical uh discourse and technique and dramaturgy and so on and that I was thinking that again I mean one start watching it and then I catch myself the it's automatically that you go if you have if you're training a certain way you cannot stop critique like your brain goes like boom this is not good right um and then then I catch myself after some like automatic automatization and then it's like oh wait but this is an interesting like does it matter actually because for what is relevant um I'm speaking personally and also I'm seeing like a lot of the people what I'm seeing speaking with people who have more uh in buff like people who have like they I will say that I respect their work very much is people they are in the spectrum of uh ecologies of Labor so capitalism an ecologist of Labor um so questioning production basically [Music] um then then I was like going there like I mean if that's a place that I'm interested uh the fact that you're doing this in a certain way and you know and then it makes me think then it doesn't matter that it's not good in certain canons right um yeah that's also interesting because actually like that that what you said about your your friend was trying to like take dance uh have dance practice because it's also like in a way it's very like ephemeral or like very like what's the right word I mean it changes right it's hard for I don't know if he can actually keep that to always have this quality because if he's doing a lot becomes different and that's what happened to me as well like in the first performance I did at the nacho like not the one I described but we had this kind of like midterm showing in the middle of the semester it was totally different I was doing more like word play and it was more like a nonsense I actually like kind of like it came from the best practices in a way that I just like play with what I have so it has like less structure um and my leggings were there my legs were there throwing clothes but actually I was throwing clothes and like I had like two parts actually at First like one was that I have like full of things it's like really like a laboratory yeah that was like really best practice like the workshop you did yeah it came from that Spirit yeah yeah but then I also tried like half like second half which is like I mean I also like relate to this like my neurodiversity and all like so on but um I just wanted to do something without like with just with my body and like nothing else and I just talk or like make yeah sound and then you know just like do crazy stuff and somehow like that became like more like uh yeah the main thing like material I wanted to work with but of course that was like it was super super interesting like to me like like how it came out and people really liked it but also like I couldn't keep that quality like playing with the words for example because then I started studying uh like practicing Spanish more so I can't just go back to like you know just playing with the words like just like like a child because now I have more knowledge and then like yeah so that that kind of like I relate to that yeah and for the last performance I did like I can't do this again because it's just yeah it was that and then it's gone yeah like there was one like that when I saw Daniella like two weeks ago in Brussels that's why she was on the line like the Danny was saying that that one of the the feedback that she gave us I mean she was saying in this work with her she was saying like I remember telling you that it wasn't it wasn't but it was not good um and that's what she remembers like uh because I guess there was so many um yeah she said I remember saying to you that uh that it was not good and I remember at the same time uh thinking like I hope he's not fixing it um I see yeah yeah um because that was the quality that's life the the the the the female reality like the the lack of of object that I think has that it was nothing somehow um that's the problem somehow with yours it's like yours is concrete here's the story and it's a story so Dan is like yeah you can have like you can have arguments like to like go to the story and and start like just chopping the story and uh because it is it is clear like what the intention is you said it from the beginning yeah what is going to happen yeah so from there like again yeah you can just really be critic about it and um yeah open open-ended Frameworks yeah but I also feel like this is like in a way what I said is like open-ended framework we can form open-ended group that's this joke hello is it Mark yeah yeah like he coined that term well it's like the the name of the is it the institution or a collective or I think it's a kind of institutional yeah part of like something anyway so far no but I I see that because I always didn't want to like have you know this kind of like narration like that was not something I works a lot in the past and also like I kind of feel awkward working with actual like narration like storytelling but then in a way this is like open-ended because it's just part of the point of my life that happened and it's like just keep changing so like now if I try to make a performance it will be different and in a way that like you know I'm not like stuck to that what I cannot get from from like as an audience like then I guess a selection of Aesthetics like you know your your decisions and the way how you spoke or no sound visuals also at first I was in there so welcome from what I get from the video is like certainly like it is like this this if what I'm understanding from what you're saying is like what you're proposing is something that is an open-ended broader scope as like my life if you'll do it like right now will be different exactly yeah yeah okay yeah in that sense it's actually like very fluid yeah yeah and I would yeah I think then I can frame it in that sense that yeah I can also tell a story in that yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah by the way this one is from Puff I've loved it says the photo yeah but the text it says it's a shape but doesn't have a shape a white blob often appears in my imagination perhaps it was inspired by a short novel written by a Japanese sci-fi writer Shi Ichi Hoshi or his follower in which a wide sphere appears to me it is it it is roughly one meter in diameter and soft with human body temperature that was the Chaos Theory bread Oh I thought it was a rock that's what I'm saying [Music] it's like the the way I worked with this is like I had like specific like name or like point in my life but it's hard to find images from that because for example like it's like from 20 30 years ago then I don't have that photo so I have to find something that has that texture that I want to tell but from like a new photos or like I have to you know like generate with the AI stuff or whatever yeah yeah well sometimes like I have like specific photo for my childhood but I it's not like also like my intention to use them a lot I never understood and I still I don't understand how to pose for pictures you do pose for pictures absolutely not true my parents like to travel while we were in Australia where we spend a year and came back twice for vacations nevertheless they rarely took us four trips within Japan but I traveled with my brother for a few times Barcelona in 2012 and Okinawa in 21. Who Who Are You the blue one actually it's funny because and who is she is my sister I have a sister yeah out of my brain I don't know where my brain is actually in my one of the suitcase I have at school anyways it's also in here I saw it like that you people can buy Naruto's brain in the website yeah just have to go to my Shopify yes did you saw I send you something about this person um somebody who's doing their note or something in National Electronica that was the guy who they select when I applied for us Electronica it was between this guy who I send you now this link for the residency yeah electronics between him and me and then when I checked actually I thought like okay his work is very very very very advanced this is a window that moves onto the yeah recognized it yeah the pointy triangle windows were in a bathroom of Monson yeah I find shapes everywhere when I find a corner I draw an imaginary line pointing into the space from the corner I avoid is intersecting the imaginary line very choreographic well I didn't think that way but I don't want to think that way then I have to think that way now no um it's funny I never thought about it but if you lay out like this and then it really looks like Windows on the desktop we have about the Aesthetics come from there so yeah but like like just like putting on top of it it really looks like that though because it happens like that and on the computer but I don't understand why you're surprised if the Aesthetics come from there I know but like it's just having that in a physical life it's like it's just funny I didn't because I didn't really okay think about it I mean of course it's windows but yeah yes okay it's not on sale yet but I'm thinking about it you know it's crazy people steal them well not steal them but like if I show it at the like a presentation like they are like I can't keep this like no this is my artwork but yeah because the thing is it's a bit is it's you need to find some strategy to be clarify this because it is Contra you know for instance like YouTube but the way what happens with Annie like so you say hello you have this energy you know like very lovely energy I'm happy to see you I have this for you by the way I have something else and then you start with this but I cannot give it to you so it's like comp it's like the energy is going it's not this is you make no sense I know but I I think that that that's something I want to share that I'm struggling because like you know people don't return or like I just always have to say it now because then and how many cars are uh this is like 55 and how you can so are you counting is it is complete you don't want to count it now you're gonna get pissed off right yeah because I mean okay okay and I give one or two is gone it's okay but but then it's not about like if it's there or not it's it's about you know the the idea you know because it's my artwork right if someone steals your painting then it's like why you know you can't just keep it and it took so much time and energy for that but I think it's the medium but that's also interesting yeah so that's interesting it's a topic because then it's I mean what it makes it it's just like people cannot see some art piece like uh so then they just think it's a piece of paper you know like then they can just say yeah I mean if it's like a business card then I will I will also think like that if I was in puff and then I can just take one right so I'm I was thinking like I was wondering if I would put it at the kitchen today but I don't know also kitchens or you can just put like yeah you can put it there but I don't know like would I know that now so knowing like you know like in my some car get lost yeah I mean also like it works in exhibition because then I have I always make the the label the the title and name and year so if if it's there then you would say okay it's like artwork yeah it's like it's just Framing and I really like to make those because it's like you know then if there's something else here and I put the label then it looks like artwork artist plastic artists or ceramic artist or whatever but no but yeah I remember like yeah yeah that's that's the whole point of this yeah and I I really like to like yeah this is just like another interest I have that I want to work with this somehow with plastic artists no other exhibition new design you know and I'm really not interested in like a white space like the place I did the performance I also did exhibition and it's like a really garage place right garage theater um and I really liked it because then I just put things everywhere and then for example if I use this space then it feels like you know you are well I mean you are intentionally choosing the space right yeah and then the band it gave so much complexity because then the bookshelf is a part of the exhibition or not or like is there like something hiding as a network and it became like so rich yeah yeah that's why I mean that's part of like the the I mean the scholarship that I applied was about I mean it was about curatorial studies right uh but what was important interesting from this uh place is that they underline that the studies goes about the Paradigm shifts the technology brought okay so for me that was very interesting as somebody who's working with media uh how to present work for all these topics that you're saying what is relevant now but then then I guess you have to understand uh yeah some things that I don't know I guess that's why you stay here that's why I want to study but they give me thanks uh by the way to the new center it's a very interesting place they have uh having fun place a part of path with some Frameworks actually to be honest like very specific topics that they are somehow transversing and circuit bending uh closely uh uh yeah very relevant question I guess in Western philosophy and Western yeah for example Western philosophy very much about politics Capital capitalism ecology and politics I will presume like that um so they have different postgraduates in design and collateral studies uh yeah other three fields that I remember right now yeah one is more in philosophy and the other one is something else um I yeah but I was sharing that I applied for a grant uh for a scholarship and they give me half of this scholarship which I I'm really appreciate but I need it but it's scholarship I cannot pay 4 800 I mean uh half of that which is 2 400 euros I don't have money to pay that and you I mean they break it down they say like yeah you can do it like this I'm paying 180 Euros per month like I cannot I don't have that incomes a steady income every month um it will generate a burden right now for me it's a subscription yeah but yeah I will try to follow some of the free courses okay because there's some free stuff but you're gonna just follow the helping yeah this is like also interesting to like look into like they are like open platforms where you can you know like follow free courses and yeah for example I mean I haven't really done much but one I really appreciate from uh I think it's KO University from Japan where they have the hijikata archive they have they basically yeah talk about the I mean you just have to read and you know watch some videos about hijikata archive like or like the the his uh like biography like how he found the Pluto and then uh brutal notation and all these things and like it was really nice no that's why also I do these things I'm really obsessed with archive because of what he was doing I mean the interesting thing about archives yeah sorry they are going on just no no the interesting thing is like he didn't really make an archive right he just left so many artifacts and then people started making archive which is one way of doing it I guess but I mean I think it's just like we we were talking with that with Madeleine and also I think I shared this idea with you of this the Bell where he ever remember now also that nalina fought with me about this argument of um like classically speaking in Western philosophy like then you have this um idea of the art as a novel thing okay so the artist searching for the masterpiece so the unique Masterpiece is the ultimate thing of the artist they just speak by itself like and so there are a lot of philosophy around these things but something that it just doesn't have to justify but it just it is it just speaks for itself so what happens is when people are geniuses and can Master these things then other people to Archive these things so it happens in similar to yeah I mean his case is like he's a genius it should be like I mean I don't know his work but like should be very much like if there's so much around is because clearly there should be something special and then other people just take that role and he just doing that like he's just doing his art yeah but I think it's especially in dance it's hard because you know you don't leave artifacts normally is a dance piece but he did like I mean he made like you know scrapbooks for his inspiration I know he talked a lot to his apprentices and apprentices they have to take notes you know for the choreography because choreography like basically is just talking about this like notation this is notation but it's basically like you know he has like different names for different you know movements or scenes and then they have to you know take notes so they you know the apprentices took notes so that became an artifact and there's also like this brutal cut in I think it's on the web you can yeah we can search for brutal notation and it's like hyperlink to like different ideas and yeah like people still like because but everything came because she's got to basically left some things yeah but I guess we're not that famous yet so we have to leave things and make our own archive yes yes we have to become an institution yeah I have to I like I like that idea oh I want to bring like this what are dragons okay really like with my hometown and the the path uh around here it looks like I mean the composition is the same so you know like this is do this year oh okay yeah yeah this is also interesting thing and this is a different affordance that the cards give that you don't see on the website yeah we didn't say much but we were in Amsterdam that's where our Journeys this journey started right in Amsterdam Lima like this like that's what I was thinking about yeah so then in Lima no so we were we we started to stripping when when did we started like one week ago that was a Friday yeah and then so we met in this impossium for digital transfer transformation thing [Music] so then there were different presentations and one that was really I think a point of things that we speak differently but yeah I guess my head makes sense but I cannot put it into words is this idea of software preservation must contain Knowledge Management as a key challenge we suggest a conceptualization of software preservation approaches that are available at different stages of the Soul or life cycle and can support memory institutions to assess the current a complete a completeness and applicability of knowledge yeah I think everything but I think it's at least in my head it makes sense contain Knowledge Management as an abstraction that's interesting and I think that this topic that we were speaking some time ago would like information design like when this the idea of information design gets really highly complicated then you start speaking about assistant systemic modeling um but they're they're the same they just study cybernetics basically um yeah you study information and systems and agency of the systems and definitions of systems and agencies and configuration basically what we let me put it in our words we said all these things like grouping and grouping right just like just just go there to this idea when we speak about grouping and a grouping right um so complex systems uh are very much about this idea of grouping and a grouping and then when uh Dragon speaks here uh and but it stays in my head and that's my interpretation of course that um that is important in the management of the in the actually in the architecture of information um is to allow a framework that is so abstract that allowed for Knowledge Management so that's something that yeah is it's like it's something that in a way is Contra is contralictory by itself because uh you have a bunch of information and then you're trying to structure the information in a certain way that is helped the best for the users right and then you propose certain Frameworks but because the nature of their archives are static then there is so much going on into uh maintaining these systems and after at some point then you cannot maintain the the the system anymore and then the software goes down I mean all these topics that in terms of uh yeah how much cost to keep up with these softwares um because anything is so everything everything is in movement everything is moving so the informations and the Frameworks where information is happening is moving fast so technology is fast then it's very difficult to make an unique or like a an answer to the best way to Archive material wait so you're talking about archive or like specifically like to the what dragon was presenting about this like different software for example like Windows like new windows new iPhone iOS version and you have to keep up with that yeah yeah because I it was archive is and it's related but it's not interchangeable I thought I mean we could make analogy but then like I don't know what you mean by like maintaining archive because then you're more dependent on this no no the maintaining the systems who are what are that are running their archive maintaining the software right in that sense to keep it to keep it running so for example okay now we built this archive on Windows 98 and then Windows XP is coming so you have to migrate or if you don't have sort of migrate then it will be dead yeah I mean that's exactly like uh the case with um this brutal Caden it's uh it's by Yukio waguri one of the appearances of uh hijikata and he basically I don't know like how this happened but uh like the institution took over I mean they he collaborated with institution that they put this notebook into a CD ROM like digital version that you can purchase and you can see it on your computer and then of course now that's really deprecated I don't know if it was cd-round with DVD ROM but then now and then they have to like have to you know change like convert it for the website because then it's more accessible and then like basically like they were like asking for donation because you know this is always happening and uh even if it's archive static archive the platform changes so that affects like how yeah how it can be accessible so I think it's uh like because that's like really concrete example I don't know exactly like if other I can come up with other like specifically in archive like suffering from this transition of like platform like system you know the proprietary software basically yeah that Microsoft give like cells or apple cells well I think like the point that I was trying to make is uh is that is is really I guess it's a high level of abstraction to say this and I don't have the arguments to uh to to to put it more clear but when he speaks about like Knowledge Management that doesn't I mean you cannot speak you can speak about Information Management knowledge knowledge management this is almost as a is peace provoking in saying this I I I assuming that he's provoking and saying Knowledge Management doesn't exist it doesn't cope with doesn't go you can speak about Information Management um because knowledge is local experiential and income knowledge is is something uh for humanities to speak about it so when he mentioned these things and we have this more conversation with him about how he he was asking me what do you think when I was mentioning embodiment in that context the way we put it um he does he does that with the idea of provoke so it's a very artistic approach that he's doing um and from what I I think I'm trying to underline that is is brilliant is that since these things are really complex right like maintaining the software of there are different factors why it's so difficult to create document to to document uh these processes um since these are see since uh process of documentation of media art are very complicated you need uh approaches that are liquid that try to make more liquid and more fluid something that by nature is static you you create Windows 98 and you will systematically upgrade create Box new versioning and at some point you stop doing it so our solid Frameworks the and that's why he was using this kind of when he was doing this when he was like talking about these things uh it's about abstracting something because the abstraction of something it allows for how to say this like and I guess that's the whole the pro the money the problems or one of the things that I have been that I heard recently when speaking about systemic modeling or cybernetics what is very much about information management is that you cannot have an absolute answer to things to questions and that is when this idea of complexity enter and then allow other voices because one answer is not enough like uh so when things are uh and when things are so complicated approaching this from a binary point of view or deterministic uh is not helping therefore abstractions analogies Poetics and other uh triggers like dragon is speaking about Knowledge Management triggers provocations allow for other contingencies to happen okay because yeah I think that's that's the term that I was searching is a contingency the the fact because it's not about you and me trying to describe a process that either of us know very very well um in terms of what is something to coin something specifically but I think what I'm trying to point here is there is uh I mean I'm uploading his effort in abstracting the nature of of what he's doing like working the computer to obstructing and trying to embody it uh the process okay yeah I mean I guess we should close I don't know I one thing I want to say I don't know if it's related or not that's why I'm saying um like specifically for archiving I noticed that like this was like like photos of archiving like things and then what I struggled most not just First Step but throughout the the process was like what categories I need I need a name image but first like actually I was super ambitious like I want like each element to have a website a web page or like a Hydra sketch or something but then this is trade-off that it would be super interesting as a content for like every element but then I can't have like hundreds of them like in the end I think I have more than 100 but then like if I prepare like that elaborate thing for everything then probably I end up with like 10 pages which is also interesting but then or sometimes you know you need to make it easy so that you can just go on and on and on yeah so yeah that's kind of the question and that's that's something I learned by doing and then I always have to like change the the how to say the columns the labels for every for the database the classes the classes no but uh yeah it's a joke it's a joke so that's kind of like the practice of archiving maybe we should go to that I mean like like but practice of archiving also has the abstraction part as well as a design and you know you know yeah but no concluding I don't think that no not really like from what I'm trying to say but no because because about the contingency but I yeah I mean we should go soon but then because they also like related to contingency in a way that I have this you know room that I can change the database on the way to be like fluid not that I start definitely I need this this this for this database I need to write title I don't know here blah blah blah and then I start from there I mean I need a starting point but yeah it could change that's that's how I saw the contingency but I don't know if that was uh your intention not really but okay so maybe we just close here and see when we do the next one maybe we'll be somehow wow but yeah but anyway like yeah I don't wait when like something's gonna happen also like so uh yeah we'll see you next time yeah and did you notice that though the paints on the camera the paint yeah what is what is the thing yeah because I was holding this during the when I was in thailona oh so yeah then they're asking me to paint stuff and I can't you know like sometimes I have to like grab the camera when my hands are still wet to the ink and then that's still there yeah just a little story yes okay so please subscribe like the video and we'll see you next time number three ciao", "8kE8tx3PCwE": "nice recording okay bye the second shot you're back wait what are they into because the first one is one and the first one is called one but I mean I will add it I I kind of like it yeah one two this is two yeah this is me like this is the amount of energy that I can put all that it's crazy huh like every time I mean I'm not saying that I do crazy stuff but but it's also like keep doing this is like a lot of work surface of practice in itself yeah yeah but I just found it anymore I mean more and more of them that I work and also doing applications like dance and Technology specifically oh is the one of the main topics is documentation like because nobody knows how to deal with archiving and is obvious because the technology is moving everything is moving so how to optimize these things yeah and also not only how to optimize because that's really completely approach to do this thing right sure like optimization yeah um so maybe on that topic I would like to try to think I was thinking that I found this very intriguing to me like you were doing some jokes remarks on this like I wanted to I mean I guess you have to work with technology and stuff like that and it seems to me that so now working with virtual reality and how to now is sewing it I think it's very interesting like the how how are we in the places that we are um I mean being you an engineer coming so the uh it's interesting this is from yesterday bye sorry for this I think we can well let's see how it goes which office to for the payment because tomorrow we're going to be cooking and then the day after I will be leaving so but it is fine because we are just next to the kitchen yeah it's a good reminder because otherwise I would not have been forgotten I mean tomorrow I can do it too yeah yeah so no rush but yeah yeah I mean this I don't know why I started doing it uh I was just interested but also like I mean actually this isn't related to like my next project or the ongoing project right now that um yeah it's kind of like it's not speculating or projecting but it's about future but because in the the other work I did so Last Summer is very Northern Hemisphere way of saying yeah like around August no July August yeah I got uh funding thanks to Parks it's okay and whatever so basically I could do whatever but I decided to make a website and like of course I forgot the cards upstairs but um that was around the time I was going to Colombia I mean actually like it was kind of overlapping basically I collected memories and in the end like I collected memories and that's on the website but also I made cars out of like printed ones as far as I like cut by hand and then I the next division like iteration I ordered online so it's really nicely done so I had the same opportunity this year I mean I had a I'm having like right now and I just said like okay so I did the past in the previous one so I do the future and then okay I get it I get it it was a really simple idea actually yeah I get it so like not even a speculate but this is the thing like I don't want to like kind of speculate or like project like it's not like something that I want to like find like a pathway to something specific but I want to like find like different options like where it can go okay like that's just I mean it's just a wording but the way of thinking I think it's for me it's interesting because now people everyone's talking what's very speculative whatever but then that's actually kind of like well I guess there are different ways different approaches but for me like you know it's kind of like finding a truth kind of idea that I just have a feeling from the world like that something specific will happen or at least like your it's not like something multiplied but like monolithic future that's hanging somewhere instead I'm trying to think like what can be like done like like for now like what I'm doing what can I repeat what could be become like you know part of my future so it's more like multiplied and for example this is like one example because then I do it I can redo it and they can wear it again so it's kind of like first well not projecting but like repeating towards kind of you know one of the features that is an option so I'm not sure where you don't want to have the holes in the salt because then it's going to just become bigger and bigger that can be one way you know just like okay I'm just gonna wear this socks with hole and this becomes bigger and bigger but that's like one of the things like I want to think like what can you know grow from now yeah like this is what I chose to you know repair them but also you can but that's the interesting part right you can like start to like you know find what's what are the options from here like this is what I chose but you can decide to wear it with holes and then that's also okay and um but I think that's kind of like what I'm interested in a way of like futurism but I think like maybe bringing this back to uh I guess what I was proposing what I said before was like making this remark on I find fascinating how material is your work these days and how abstract is becoming my work I also more when I'm since like I started like trying to take that path that is uh also through complexity sciences and things like that the level of abstraction is really um it's it's very different um and and I just find fascinating like there's just not really like what how are we doing um and then I should do a document we should contact them and I think now she's a ux senior at some company okay she's like user experience senior and some company good for her yeah but also I don't think it's uh like you know it seems like an interesting job the company is not I don't know Facebook or something like that I can feel some interesting yeah like a start yeah I don't know I don't know I don't know I didn't really think just like what they should say it seems more like a yeah [Laughter] speculative the approach was the singularity you're not against it I'm just proposing yeah but I I also like to come back to like what she was doing because that's super interesting you know like just like watching hours and hours of you know like hundreds of hours of documentation I mean you know video material and yeah basically making sense of that yeah and that's like also part of something I want to do during this like thinking about future like so basically I did a performance in Colombia and that's haven't seen it right the last one no that I did like I spoke in Spanish for like 45 50 minutes and that's like that's about the past basically like kind of like I drew like ideas like memories from the the other project I did like you know like what where I lived in you know what is inspired what in the you know for example in martial arts in Japan and then I started combat conversation and back to this kind of like rooms collections from memory but then like if I think about what that I was doing then that's also like you know I could think about like connecting that to towards the future not just like analyzing what happened but like Okay so what was the pattern and where it's going yeah yeah I mean there is something that I mean like hot city is like I tried it I'll try to do my best to explain myself because I don't even understand so wait it's like I think I see some similarities in the way home um era and my my girlfriend and I will never see this that day I don't think this is very interested in what we do so but she has like this natural telling for like she's very practical she's very Prime and she's very practical um and quotation I mean so like if she don't like houses that much somehow like when I'm trying to make this remark as something that I really admire from the designer point of view she's just like boom um while I'm just getting lost in taking so long to answer an email like you know my workflow I get really lost in in my thoughts um so that's something that I really admire that she's just gonna naturally into this um and I see some relations from like like some connections with but uh also the way how you work um that is are different practices um um that are complementary you know like one practice is like uh in a way opening Frameworks like to question things and like all more open things and other practice also is it's like close to um information design in in information design deals with that the design of information how you structure information for certain purposes okay like for example like like uh you have to do planning you have to plan for two years that's uh then you you structure the information in a in a way that is understandable uh without I mean when you're not writing the using words that use more like visual element so a timeline for wrist and something what you saw in the place that you were in the in my room that was this the poster that we saw horizontal that's information design okay then you show like linear what happened visually and you have this um so that demanded some levels of abstraction that that can go the more you do the more more complex we come because you have to take decisions and cut stuff out right right um yeah um and that's something that it is in constant negotiation with oh so what I'm saying is basically this idea like you need open friend open-ended Frameworks in design actually that's why I I I I'm happy that you saw that in that poster because the main idea of that poster has two diamonds like one Diamond over diamonds like uh there is this classical approach to design well I don't know if it's classical or not I think it's not classical it's about it man a framework called the same thinking that is you first you create a phase of ideation or when you are brainstorming and then you start converging and then it's called Double Diamonds because you just need two times this process to start converging I'm providing and then you do it again then you work in something that are called sprints um which are quite a standard things to make uh fast prototypings of good products where has this focus on human centered design that I think nowadays is very question because of the world like the oldest design methodologies that are pointing to human-centered design um so the anthropos in prison and now we are more in a parallel shift with uh with echocentrism or others isms or the human being in the center and everything in the center as a human is being questioned I see so like why are we doing the design because practical approach I think what I was trying to mention was the SE things were by hand right like you to do open-ended Frameworks and you need to to use this approach to information designer into structure I mean in Academia are missing complex design that goes through this course that is called modeling systems okay like uh um computer science and go to modeling systems I already study of complex systems which deals with things are not linear like and we saw that with the audio like normally like yeah anything that is not chaotic can be measured in a linear way and it has a lot of time and a line that goes somewhere so you can foresee uh I mean the linear but then anything anything that cannot get into that category of linearity is considered as Noble or new uh and then therefore as a complex I mean sure like not from the philosophical point of view but from the mathematical point of view and it is always in constant negotiation Within the specific factor that happened at that moment so the good example is very simple examples like population a kitchen you know like really human things like that you cannot measure how how to be more effective at the kitchen in life you can you cannot uh um that's a that's a complete system that's what I'm trying to say that about why we were saying this systemic modeling the systemic modeling that is all this informative yeah so you have open-ended framework like say in a way art philosophy and then you have the word on the other hand you have reductionism approaches which is interesting because like now all these things about complex designs although it's still within Sciences right like so fundamental sinuses um so physic schemies um they are open but let's not get lost into this discourse of the um these things have to go now Hand by hand uh and it's interesting it's always interesting I was I was thinking a bit of um some reflection that I have like before dinner with some of this with some some uh some guy we were talking yesterday and somebody was mentioning this idea of you're talking about queer Frameworks and things like it and then somebody was mentioning try trying to clarify some concepts of queer what are these things um what is not also and then what she was mentioning this idea of allies to our Palace and that's something that it stays in my head I'll speak regards to what my mother was saying I mean it's just in regard to um supporting other ones so yeah yeah it's kind of like something I found very difficult to articulate like I think at one point we're saying like you know like what we do let's say it's queer and well trust is a big word that does it doesn't have to be functional we we said something like that and then I don't know I could just if it was I to D or something and then someone asked us maybe it was here like because yeah like why queer but no it was a specific comment that do you mean it doesn't is not functional and then I was like thinking yeah okay yes that was really like a big statement if we say you know it doesn't have to be functionality you have to like frame it for like in a better way for example also like I always question like what we do is try to soften or like to make something soft but it actually is soft you know like oh perhaps but also like you know it can have different textures you know it can be it can be hard or it can be solved and then these like we can't go something like as I said before like it's not something you know singular it's not something that no that's that's like something difficult to articulate because what we're trying to say is like this kind of like multiplicity like but then then I think there is it has to be very careful and there's especially like within Western uh Academia to not have to justify oneself it is very this is very I mean this is something that starts seeing in Academia I mean another machine also it's a question also this like so it's difficult how what is that line when you basically are compromising yourself in order to say institutions and Frameworks like yeah institutions in different ways um they have this solidity they're really solid and then through queerness of open-ended Frameworks you try to make things more liquid that's an analogy that I use try to liquid make more liquid fluid more fluid like uh something that is solid so working towards choreographic strategies that allow for fluidity of solid spaces if not possible then I practice the aims for that possibility uh in that sense you have seen I mean I put it like I'm saying these words out because we use these words in the practice as the he's just in the practice that becomes real like even if so for some few seconds or whatever right which is a gesture a suggestion that creates possibility for other things to transverse which I I found that that that word uh very brilliant and an expansion is somebody was explaining to me and then I was surprising documented transversal but in the same like no I don't even understand because too much about that but I was surprised the way who she was speaking about it in this space of a party office there was this Mexican car a character and then she was telling me that he he she came out just two years ago and it changed completely in her life and her life right now I mean back in the end documentary was that her artistic work was her life and she was coming from a high class in Mexico in our privileged place that you should have seen in Colombia like the difference between those who have education and the access to those resources and those who have no resources so that makes a huge balance that that it's difficult to just to embody because it is not about a rational thing is to feel how how to imagine how how to write about poverty or things like that and I remember some time I was having a discussion with Angelina and she I love I love Angelina very much and she has this really this heart and she's super she's she's a lovely human being she's actively trying to do things that I'm not for instance like she's more she's political in her doing and so on um and then she was speaking at some point and we got into some kind of discussion about these topics of uh I mean I guess being sure she was saying some things about poverty and for me it was a bit touching after we were drunk so but then I just said to her that I don't dare to speak about that because I don't know what is that but then but then I feel for me like a bit more that is taking too much uh appropriation to to go into start speaking with social confidence about poverty yeah I mean this is like intersectionality right it's like you're from Colombia doesn't mean that you can talk about poverty in Colombia I mean you can talk about it but you don't represent it or you know what it represents I mean these words are really hard but uh yeah like or like I cannot talk about Japanese woman because I'm I was really male but I can talk about my experience in the Japanese right yeah biological email or person right and that's something like I found interesting like you said like something that you you know you know it's not rational that you feel and then when I did a performance like final performance in Colombia it's not gonna be the last one but um like so basically it was about my life you know where I was born where I studied and then I came to Colombia and then yeah like also the life uh four months in Bogota and then I went to Santa Marta in Sierra Nevada and then you know the indigenous people and I just you know showed what I embodied from experience there I don't want to go to details too much because then I have to start doing performance but that would be actually funny um and then what was interesting is like nobody really said anything about the content like after the performance yeah you were saying that yeah that was really interesting like everyone was like really like like I got like positive comments like although like I was at one point making fun of like Colombia but also like that you know I make fun of myself like someone also said like I went to Colombia to exoticize myself remark I'm I said I'm Chinese which is not but people would say that if they don't know where I'm from so this is yeah so but that I felt is interesting because if I do the performance something like that then like here then people start talking about you know politics yeah about like rational yeah actually there was one um yeah like some people from Germany watch the performance and they're more talking about the content itself which I found interesting and how different like how people perceive but then foreign were like a more important of content and then you could enter to some is that what you're saying well I think it depends on content because that was about my life you know I don't want anyone to criticize about my life so it's good that people don't talk about it actually I mean also that's why people maybe like talk about it because you know my life I don't have anything that they would you know say okay you shouldn't have been there [Music] or not that German guy said that but um yeah so kind of like I found it's interesting I never thought like I would do something political and it was not political but also like kind of like carries but it is like yeah I mean this is the kind of thing like when foreign like this really hard discussion of she's as I said she's actively doing things politically so she will go walk and do these things like myself I don't subscribe to these things I don't do it yeah but I also like her work is political like we have a friend of us that is a dance divine yeah she she's somebody I think through her like I would say like that I discovered that I'm that I didn't find myself as non-binary and she when we met the first time uh in Brussels we have this discussion like I was working on the my final project so I was writing the best practices so all this theory was in my head right so I have this uh fixed idea that uh that we use sometimes that the best uh moment what of the the best the potentiality of the art of the painting in the museum is in the budget right yeah yeah like um but anyway is like referring to this idea of um the uh whatever art in the sense of an art that is not political uh it's just an image that it has to there is an interface more for the person to start doing something with it rather than taking some position like propaganda Aesthetics formality normativity or not um but more like an interface like a door for X things to happen um and so yeah so this was what I said to them it's like I'm not political engaged because then is up to the person how to engage and do their own processing so this active inspectorship basically right it's not it's not entertainment but it's something that it demands the person to engage with the art piece or to leave and also knowledge engage and it's fine but it Demands a decision for the person so but of course like then we're going back like just to the Persona who you are like you know because we were there talking is I'm conscious and I'm getting more conscious of my decisions in the way avoid yourself how I make up when when in the place where I am is giving me more certainty of the Persona that I am uh so but it's not because I'm trying to I mean I guess unconsciously it goes a person is political like you have a body you have a body yeah yeah your voice political but it's different that I guess maybe that could be I don't know this is an assumption now following this threat that perhaps because she's coming and from Switzerland um uh I may be questioning her own privilege she wants to help otherwise she feel these struggle right so he's coming from all these really good place it's not because you want to be an [\u00a0__\u00a0] like but then the way so I know but but uh but so she's then engaged with these things that I don't I cannot know what she's experienced what is experiencing it's just I cannot take her position of doing what she does um but I'd recognize also that we come from different places and that doesn't make us better or wrong but it just means that we are from very different places and just lately not too long ago I started reflecting then you need to find allies and uh or like for instance she's my family like in that in that sense like in terms of gender she's my sister um and and when it allies in especially in this yeah in context in a thing in yeah close to what you said that just explain about her like I felt like similar in a way like for example like the final showing I didn't informata is like the money from the school I'm in in Germany from KJ and yeah like each student gets some budget so we can spend it or certain things not everything but but like you can get a jacket and stuff um this cost of 200 euro a year um you know what I want to say like then I I didn't really like plan to like go to go well I plan to go to Colombia but then I didn't really plan to do a performance in the end but I just butted it in you know like okay but I was a bit skeptical I just wanted to fill it in some numbers so I just put there and but in the end like I was like okay I really need to find a space I'm gonna do a festival in the hotels festival and invite students from maestria and you know invite people do something nice which was like not in a way like I didn't really start from the idea that okay I have money so I wouldn't use it for you know people in Colombia but in the end it became like that I don't know like looking back like what happened I I'm really happy like how I use my money I mean of course I use it for myself as well but then going there and like spending money from geography to rent a space and you know they people like me for food and then doing something like a action which is like I found this really nice like it's not about like you know if I did something good or bad but it's just like I was really surprised like how it kind of concluded like this project and it's kind of like also part of like my life in a way it's just like another life event it's not like okay I want to support these people and I go there and do something but it's just like something happened and then okay they're friends they do this and also like for like one um visitor like I was doing the nail salon as well during the festival and what Mr like she was doing some like handicraft stuff so she couldn't really paint I couldn't paint her nails but she recognized the the brand of the one I had and she knew that they don't ship they are based in the US um and the famous in YouTube so she knows it but they don't ship to Colombia so she's going to get it and anyway it's like super expensive and I had something because that's also like from the budget from the school so I guess like a bunch of them so I gave it to her um and yeah she was really happy and that was I was also really happy that I could you know kind of like yeah they can just take the you know institution well not softening into that particular institution but you know take advantage like take advantage of my privilege like basically and not like throwing away like okay I should be poor to feel and poor but like you know if I have privilege just use it and then if someone benefits from that then it's perfect and that's what I really felt for this whole festival thing yeah maybe going back to this idea of um it's scarcity and sharing sharing resources because I think it is like say like art and Tech like dancing dancing technology uh tastes like it's almost like a joke to speak about dance and technology so like let's say more like art and Technology yeah yeah but in a sense I mean the framing is different but uh yeah anyways yeah um that how to find I mean it's like I don't know why it's like that not in general or something like that I don't know like this thing of just like keeping my I keep my contacts I keep like this it this thing of not sharing uh the resources and that's what I mentioned in scarcity because maybe so it's not in the same day oh I'm poor I live in Hamburg it's like no but it's in terms of like scarcity but there is not so many resources or at least there is no the idea is that there is no so much um I'm just guessing though then people are not sharing the possibilities because it's about possibilities um because it means that if you share the possibility intrinsical you also are reducing your chances to get that possibility and I think that should come from a traumatic space of a scarcity I have a slightly different take I mean maybe I would like kind of more like focus in let's say open source it's it's a lot of work to share you know like it's not like you just make something for yourself and you put it online okay that's already some work you just have to set up a GitHub account for example on guitar repository and you put it there that's like first step right that's okay that's not so bad but then like if you want to like you know actually share the moments we need a documentation you need to actively develop something that's evolved like that will take over the whole process yeah but I'm not talking about that but it's not the same because like if you want to share because then you can't just like put it out you need to really like you know if you want to do Workshop then you need to prepare material no no no I think I'm talking just like with this like just simply like places where you finally you know just this like open calls or these things that that it seems how to say this I'm just reflecting like for instance that so I'm working with uh art and Technology since 2018 more or less and then I guess really like the more with some professional opportunities from 2019 I guess [Music] um and then uh remember how like I'm still fine always always found trying to find Opportunities um so now I receive these things and then I'm thinking also uh it makes me question also them reflecting to the conversation with Marlon um I mean I don't have an answer it's just like it's more like why why why it's like that why we have to keep these things some kind of like no I don't know for example like I I see something online and I don't tell you about it because we can be competitor is that like what's yeah yeah I mean also like that I think it happens in different levels but for example you said about Marlon but uh uh like he has its platform right but yeah he shares but that's again like like come back to like what I said like it's a lot of work to because also he has a curate and he has to you know put it out so that's like ultimate you know like dedication to like sharing but also like it can happen like a micro level like I see something and I send it to you yeah but then I guess like there's I think there are two different things that we're speaking like one is more like that I completely uh produce and I guess most of the people who are close to me also uh working towards open source in different ways or even just supporting the idea of Open Source right uh since is one of them Angela is super in this although there is many contradictions but just like the idea I'm supporting uh open free flow of knowledge digital knowledge um so there's one thing this avocacy on this and then the other one is then and that's I think that's what I was trying to say that I cannot find I guess like able to express myself then how because it's not easy I mean how to to build networks basically uh institutions if infrastructure then going back to the Symposium of digital creation uh digital transformation I think was cool and Amsterdam reservation digital.com the conservation of Lima that happened to the last weekend I was speaking about like and I really like that coming life since things I guess I think maybe he is going close to this I mean not answer but it's like more suggestions like since this network and since there is this scarcity that I will question also here let's say here in Europe since there is a scarcity in digital art then how to um yeah basically then just you work towards you I like that he was putting this the just your work you played your own Institution um and even it's just even just as a gesture uh where in that category I will put your Festival you know when you say like nautical Festival that's that's a gesture the worst time creating an institution uh and it's basically just offering possibilities for for for things to transverse and circumvent spaces and people culture for good or wrong so then again uh bringing back this like trying to make the concrete is I guess it's more like it's more like a screaming in the air I guess like just trying to reflected to work towards Network like to to try to work towards I guess this Spirit of Open Source or like trying to to share I don't like that word anymore to [Music] now I think that's that's why I think this I started speaking about allies because since this that I'm speaking is becoming more and more abstract like if you start speaking about sharing and other things then the easiest way or anything one can understand this is like if you think in your family or like somebody close you just share different resources that's just what it is the family then there are allies I mean I will see them as allies in like not the bloodline but as a did you understand what I'm saying with this I think so but that's like kind of given you know but that's what I'm trying I just use it as like you yeah but do you understand what I'm saying then I mean I don't know like what I like but I have some remarks I don't have to remark um what's interesting I mean the network and Ally these ideas like I was you know a couple years ago I was reactive in processing and I was basically making platform or like Network I was running it that was a lot of work I guess like that's like a fraction of what marble this has been doing but then like I know that it's now I know that it's a lot of work and like this I don't like the word utopian like optimistic idea would be like you know to have something that runs by itself yeah but yeah but some some people have to run it but it's like this is incredible like what happens here I haven't seen another place like the way what they I remember when John when there was these things like the place where we are like it has this fluidity within constraints of a solid it has a house it's solid but it is fluid in the way home like things passes and um yeah I think it's a good example of there's one that I can't think about like you can't really see how like say power structures they are available somehow if you just are from the moment you arrive in the place they're like it's not so hard to find like how to reach power structure like if you compare life before let's say I mean and even though like when John was the owner also like he said yeah I mean he made this play so he said yes it was just very generous right so but then um was um but then sorry I have so what I want to make is a comparison like that and the other one that is which is not a network it's uh it's not a community but things are happening it's just happening yeah like it's also like really uh Martins uh the podcast thingy and that's to me that was easy because then I just do it and that's it yeah but also like it's yielding it's you know it gives potential potentiality into some something to happen which I found like for me it's easier because then I'm you know I can't keep doing things for like years and years and years right no I completely yeah right yeah Festival it's in Colombia it's in Japan you know just do it yeah yeah it's also you know benefiting from the the existing Network I have but still like I don't have to run that Network which I found is interesting yeah absolutely and then we have to do our Festival yes yeah so that's gonna be different you know like this that's a nice video with this video that I did my festival and we did our festival and it doesn't have to do anything between them because it's a different structure and it's temporary or we can do it again and again if you like if you like but it's uh yeah like kind of like this um it's not ecosystem how do you say like kind of it's like creature in itself it's interesting yeah it's interesting but maybe we can close with this yeah yeah I guess we can go on and on and on yes to go back to work yeah okay subscribe thanks whatever peace and come to Puff come to pass", "YvbulgirwlI": "anyway so there's about five yeah a lot that's a lot that's okay yeah he's recording right it is recording okay grabando it's kind of weird like okay we have a chat so many things hello are you trying to finish it on the lens I was aiming to them to them yeah to you because you and you to they so we are back we are in path right we're back yes yes yeah last in real life chat was also I think pretty much was here I'm quite sure because it was at night I remember the last one the last one we did was here yeah yeah on the of those sessions we see it yeah at night yeah cheers cheers nice to see you yeah how are you I'm great like tonight somebody in the house Christian is cooking and it's gonna be amazing so I decided I'll bring some love to the house nice today I've been it's been productive I was doing this are they clean yes I mean you wouldn't saw it when it's dirty interesting practice yes so but yeah the threat was thick right yeah this one I use thick one yeah yeah which makes sense yeah when I saw the picture I thought it makes sense yeah yeah I mean it depends on how you do it but of course if it's thinner than you it takes like much more time so I won't let crochet media but yeah this is like I think one took kind of like a bit less than one hour each one yeah I mean I was getting better and better so like the first one I did was right not this actually I didn't break it but also like last year I tried like the one that was like more like cheating you just like go around and around yeah that's something yeah yeah that's more like like in a way it's practical I mean also it's the toe so you don't see it if you're wearing shoes but I tried to like do the proper version and then I was like really hooked to it so that's keep doing and I still have like I don't know two pairs no three pairs or so so in the next days I will probably finish no but tomorrow I have meetings so probably I won't be able to yes and tomorrow I take care of the lunch oh yeah cool uh yeah I was the whole day I watched the whole day with meetings like until five and then I sleep like for half an hour and then I'm going to take a bath then I was reading the paper of Marlon ah yeah I mean hello and this one the meeting that we have today because today the meeting was with motion though okay let me say my second meeting the first one was with you that's the one that he's running or well that's the one he proposed he proposed yeah you know um but a Dao for those who don't know is a decentralized autonomous organization and it uses a blockchain technology to centralize the everything that happens in the organization is decentralized which is painful sometimes depending of the how large the organization that was one of the uh we have some break I guess in December normally and we have a first meeting like uh with them maybe two weeks ago and one of the points of some of the members was like the I mean especially those who really uh work with this because because there are nft artists there is that maybe we don't need to have everything decentralized because it's just so painful to take decisions because you cannot take decisions until yeah it's just practically speaking maybe it's not necessary for certain things so yeah but it's interesting like to see to have this insights from from from inside like to understand how what I mean what are the ordinances of these things what are the limitations of these Frameworks that blockchain provide because it's a whole idea of decentralization from a liberal point of view is very interesting it sounds very inclusive caring and so on but then you see how some reality that it uh is uh is also constrained yeah yeah because everyone has to become like part I mean like let's say that you're decentralizing Banks then everyone has to become kind of a bank in a way that like by decentralizing like everyone has to take role everybody no necessary but everybody it will be similar to how it happens here like in path where we uh no one but you need just quote them so forget that you Buffy needs half to take decisions half of the owners have to vote illegally for decisions to take me to be made here uh to change things in the regular event of the house and stuff so that's quorum which is how most of the the democracies work what is it when there is half plus one which is one then is then then they allow the things to pass but in uh the centralized organization everybody has to click or I mean at least so I click everybody needs to convey some opinion uh which makes it very yeah sometimes people are not involved so you cannot move on if everybody is not saying something okay yeah so and so for simple things you know because these are small budgets but in any way they come from institutions so we are part of near is a it's a coin near is a coin a blockchain con and we are part of the framework of art they have some framework of art but I wouldn't say I will not say more of that because I don't know that much but we are part of like some framework of Art that is promoted by near so we were supported by nearer and so the anyway there is institutional money coming and then you have to do all this yeah institution bureaucracy of how report how you use the money and everybody has to those who are legally part of this Frameworks they have to be engaged somehow they cannot be passive and that makes it impossible to run when there is not really I mean the spirit of this is open source or is there is nobody can really pay it for this these are artists work this is this is an artist thing so since there is not really support it's just it's like open sources and then then uh yeah it's not uh it's some of the insights I guess what I was trying to share um maybe with this move on is that um not everything within the group has to be decentralized some small disease yeah some basic Administration decisions just somebody who's doing the emails can do them I don't know um shall we move on yeah okay but yeah so you're reading I was reading the paper Mario and it's very interesting and by the way so I will I will put the link under the video the the recording that we have today we decided it will be public because we really touched some points of history of dance and Technology feel that I think uh I think we touched at some point very uh relevant points playing dance and take dance and take uh history so Marlon Barrios is a queer character by the way because you're asking somebody says and at some point today he was speaking and going on this queer to allocate his queer [Music] um I wouldn't say there to say too much about him but more about the network uh that is how I get to know him and he started this network called the dance Tech .org or Dance Tech nate.net that dance.net um and this paper and I was surprised because so this paper is basically um one of the books that I found in my internship in in motionbank that I didn't found anywhere but it was just it's called the La Quinta he pointed me to that book uh was a book that yeah I didn't film anywhere it was it was strange that in my search never passes through my searches until the Scots write something and then um I think then I helped to provide some of the new versions of that book if I'm not wrong it's called Transmission in motion um and in that book uh Marlon has one paper and in the paper uh is about the history of the of Dance take Network so it's like a journal with like different papers yeah it's exactly it's a journal created by it's called Hunter ah okay and put it together so it was commissioned to his caught by an scholar in Holland that I cannot remember right now and she doesn't work with an amazing ball to this color in Holland and so Marlon has one of the one paper which is about the network The Dance Tech Network and it wasn't really it was I was fascinating reading these things because I know this network since I started searching about dancing technology he was literally the first person that they found um my my browser and I remember trying to go through and also because I guess I I can be sometimes very excited then I will try to download and save everything and I remember that with this I tried to do for a few days and it was just impossible the amount of content the the this also the intrinsic uh how complex was the the hyperlinking and all these things is uh I think it's wonderful how outdated is nowadays uh the home page of dance net then of dance of this website have you seen it lately I mean you know but have you seen it all in ever I mean so what I have to confess like I never like checked it the only time I know I mean I heard of it is from you so when you like when Horizon be like uh like links I would check so I kind of have like a big idea of what it is but also like I never like really like looked into it by myself yeah but I just uh I just found another worse baby because this doesn't take me to the second look how outdated is this thing like and it still is like the this is the part of the paper it has just like this that should be like 25 categories categories within the home page which already I mean my actually my portfolio started looking a bit like this also she has his eye designer eye she was uh going on that some days ago I have a lot of these things out of there anyway so so it's not one pager yeah um but wait so in this paper there is just 11 pages he goes really and explains what the [\u00a0__\u00a0] was that so it's about that website it's about like the creation of that and then after we explain all the different categories that we I mean he's playing three sub categories that uh that are so the main framework was Dance Tech dance dashtag.net the website the main website and then we think that framework then you find interviews which is a series of different interviews where he goes around to foresight and other people oh he has like more than I think he has like around 100 interviews with people who are relevant in dance and Technology wow creates author is there of course like yeah it's incredible the amount of in-depth material that he has there archives so this has so there is the website there is the interviews and also there is something called Dance Tech TV okay and then the TV is a series it's a series of uh telematic performances anything related to video performance is a video or maybe archivals or I don't know like TV you know like there's the the TV stuff in there but you mean like they have like a kind of video channel they have a one of these so categories is a framework in itself that is all about and he goes and explains in the paper it's about performances telematic performances video dance video video dances and then he will do things within a friend that framework okay um and I think that's it that's like the three main categories that you find in the website and there is extensive material like because when did he start in 2007 okay in 2007 and when he well I was surprised of these numbers and like also it that's what I'm recommending for people who are interested in this field also if you is really pointing to the to the specific things that we should know uh we under this idea that we were talking on my house of History uh boom do you remember when I was mentioning history that is important to know about history when we try to work towards something new all right yeah yeah yeah anyway so this is very so um not safe for instance like uh when he put his website in less I think the three months he got 600 subscriptions in 2007 of people working with dance and technology in 2007 I was like I was really surprised so he started 2007 by 2010 he had he was there were 50 000 users okay now because you can make a user here it was based that's part of the paper he was he goes I mean the whole project is about open source right and affordances for the community but but so at some point he speaks in the paper that he tried different models and yeah basically never could pay by itself the thing um yeah they didn't they were managed that the project by itself never managed to pay itself with different models that he tried doing financially yeah never they never manage it like and it still is running so yeah he's putting his uh yeah the project never managed to to be self-sustainable and that was a point with Florian we talk often like about the motion bank and in terms of the future yeah but maybe I won't go with this right now to stay on point um so whatever then 50 000 years in 2010 right so you would imagine that it will just keeps on growing right that was in 2010. um that's something that I found in my research in Mobile motion bank but I started seeing all this uh in history and dance and Technology at some point is just stops okay let's stop the drawing and I guess I don't know I mean maybe people will be interesting somebody can do this like numbering somebody has to do a PhD in Festival of the dance and Technology but that's actually interesting because I could also relate to for example like creative applications.net it's like one of the biggest media arts um like I don't know like blog news and but I think it was like a thing in like 2000 I don't know like 10 and 2000 I don't know around that time but now I think it's more like I don't know I think they are like trying also like different models oh I heard that the magazine is not affiliated with them but like you know like I think you know it's not just yeah like they have changed the model as well but that was also let the attraction itself I think it's kind of yeah it's not just continuously growing I guess yeah that's very I mean that's like from uh from my research point of view you know like without going into a specific projects but just like in terms of doing like a research uh objectively that's something that is very interesting to to for me is like um it's very interesting to research like yeah uh but then why does that happen I mean like I mean I have my my own hypothesis that I won't go over here because I don't really have the arguments for that more than my intuition but why like it's this is not academic paper you can just say it in the chat because if it was because I think because I think I will start rambling this place I I guess I could I could do this more with you I guess one to one but then I think uh I will get lost in my own speaking I will get lost I think um but wait so what is what we're talking we're talking about why is that dance and Tech I have so in motion band why was it wait because I'm I'm study I study uh motion band you know like everything that I could find at them and that's why I talk extensively with Florian and then I have some interviews with house and also with Anton so I have a different information and then the thing is I don't know normally we don't know we don't know I mean I think could be that similar I mean that's my assumption also with uh art and Technology like you know what you do because at the same time but those things are happening right it's at the same time like with Marlon was like booming was 2013 15 tops 17 and from there somehow it's not that it's dropping it's just like people don't really care that much I think one of the points yes that I can share is that I think the nature of dance is ontological so uh that's something that I argue how to say this like I argue the dance I argue I think I concrete a concrete framework for instance is best practices for me because for me at the best practices is a transdisciplinary project let's let's make just like that just to be clear of these Concepts or at least to agree or disagree in this uh interdisciplinary so the difference between interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary being that interdisciplinary is a project where say in dance and Technology they work interrelating their their work um I think they is example is through Academia you have to be subscribed to at least two faculties and then so then you work you follow your research in these two faculties um so it's interdisciplinary transdisciplinary is something that what I heard from academics in Belgium it doesn't exist yet in Belgium for political reason whatever but it's something that it seems too Noble to exist yet because it's basically this idea that transdisciplinary is something that is new so you cannot separate in that example dance and Technology say like dance and interaction design so you can dance as I guess is uh Humanities uh in at a research level and then in the other hand interaction design in a research level what is class doing for instance class do we class doing as a perfect example classroom is doing another way for the picture is an interdisciplinary research where the main thing is dance and he uses things from computer interaction and other things other Frameworks but the main thing is dance is Humanities uh in a transdisciplinary like they of it's like it's almost like an Utopia at least in Belgium these days um transdisciplinary in Belgium doesn't exist because that means basically that you are creating something new so you basically don't need to be at I mean you can be at Claire for instance this place clear as a center for interdisciplinary research no I think I think they pitched themselves as transdisciplinary I won't be curious to this right now that would be very interesting to see now this is interdisciplinary but look it's just very interesting you see like it's deep interdisciplinarity but is aiming to transdisciplinarity you see and I was talking with some of the researchers there like I mean basically Thomas and that specific case it happens in Belgium because for the academics in Belgium that is just not possible yet they do not they cannot agree they cannot see something yeah new so uh like the creation of something new they see inter sections of studies so a place like Claire there is a center for interdisciplinary research aims to transdisciplinarity but then there is just a is the framework they aim to that but officially in paper the PhD students of postdocs of the research they have to be attached to uh Computer Sciences and I don't know kimik department or they have to be clearly that they have separate researches clearly in different fields although they are aiming for something that they can argue in some papers that is um the Academia Belgium won't see this as something new but in other countries like in Holland I think there is no I don't know I know in Paris in in Paris 8 there is a pH there is a masters in Translation in transdisciplinarity so I might assume that they should be phds in transdisciplinarity so it took too long but uh I don't know if you want if you want to make some remarks on these differences okay then let's just move on because it took us too long to try to put the different the difference between interdisciplinary to different ones transdisciplinary is the proposal of something they cannot be separated so that's what I was bringing best practices into the conversation because from my take and it's what I write about it and my writing is that they're in best practices it proposes the creation of something that is novel right that is new and there is interdependent we said it's a queer conversation between computers and bodies right so the way who I see it and I argue that through the writings is that yeah actually we're not even without the writing like we are really entangled Within uh the technology and the bodies all the time that's our framework so for me that's not interdisciplinarity it's not we are not studying um now let's get out of there because that's just sufficient of distractions but why why did I start speaking about these Concepts why I was trying to what was the point I was trying to make you remember before I started trying to make this difference well we were talking of Marlon um foreign we were trying to Define why is not working dance why at some point it drops the the booming of this new dance and take things yeah but I forget why what what I was trying to say I know yes I remember I was trying to say that the nature yes yes that was the point I was trying to make it was that that the the nature of dance still is is an ontology I mean us is something that exists within the moment so is the dancing Act um uh so I guess people who might be excited you know like people who are uh dancers of choreographers or people interested in working with the body then might get excited at some point let's try to do like I don't know a br app and then you know especially when it's a first time you know let's do it and then they just start doing stuff but they just really maybe I don't know it could be different things they realize is so more expensive or I mean they just confront themselves with the reality of what does it mean to work with technology um I mean you have experience working with choreographers as technician so you should have no like the confrontation of like when the artist comes to the technologist and maybe you can maybe tell us a little bit about this experience I think right now well we talked about it in a couple of years ago I guess I don't know I don't really I don't know where uh uh no I I didn't interrupt you because I thought you wanted to go somewhere you had like a agenda that you wanted to talk about that I felt do okay maybe we have the main the point made I guess at the end let me try to summarize all this is that no you don't have to I mean I the one remark I wanted to make is like I think well we have a couple days to do the chat and we can go into like deep like into like certain topics that is like burning for you for me but I feel like because we haven't met for like six seven months and I want to like catch up with you like what you feel a lot about what people are talking about what I feel or like a very good experience yeah experience that's something we haven't talked yeah experienced yeah true because I was in Colombia and you also met you know all these you know academic people different Frameworks and that's like something that you are in so yeah I mean I mean like you are in the middle of that yeah so you know it but I don't know all these Frameworks so I have no idea actually like that that's a problem that I can guess you know you talk about different Frameworks this and that I can guess okay this might be really this and that yeah like not really good um yeah to move forward like that so yeah I think it's good to like slow down and you know like just talk about you know what what else for example what I was doing in Colombia and you know it's so many interesting stories also I think yeah damn we can talk about what's the discipline and stuff yeah okay I agree with you something that I think is in order in this order of ideas I think since this academic role that I'm trying to take right now is is something that is new to me and trying to make an effort to to take the Rope then I also I can just absorb myself with him and not have the reflection of how toxic is Academia also totally so Marlon was doing some remarks today in that remark because maroon comes to Academia okay he was doing professorship at some point in NYU and and yeah and other places he had been all over the place you have to read that paper it's not I would really recommend especially this paper because it's just 11 paper pages and it just really goes to uh yeah it's relevant in history I guess of these things but then he was saying that at some point when we have the first meeting like after this holiday break that we have with motion dial then at some point I mean basically we were saying what's up you know what we're doing right now and then so people took a long time to I don't know it was sometimes very personal so become almost like this uh inside joke that we have about the dance Workshop where people have to command from their own experience what happened at the end of the workshop um so I felt it was a bit like that and then I make a comment about it without being rude but basically saying that how to address people's needs um but they're still keeping track of what we're trying to achieve somehow that because the main thread at that point is what do we want to do with this yeah because the last big thing that we have was documenta so basically you met them at documentary yes I was oldest or that was in July almost summer so I always I will say it yeah after I came from here you go to Columbia yeah yeah to see all the things that are doing from South America and other like South Global South places that are so strange but anyways another topic yeah because that's already something that document that you were there I actually never been to documenta me neither and I never heard of that until this year last but yeah last one yeah and but you were like presenting or like you were yeah we present a nine percent actually something with uh animals origin which is this guy who gives classes in Isadora so somebody who's working with that software could be friends is created so it's like a yeah it's an important figure in South America I think in dance and Tech but it's because he's a good that much but I think you're a great teacher like he's a teacher he seems to me he's somebody who's about to retire and has this uh he's a good teacher and he loves to work with this a lot and we're dancers and he comes from music okay and so but then we present something uh we did a telematic performance with him a documentary in a framework called K format within different Frameworks and documenta there was one framework that allowed the local organic some local local organizations to take complex of all stores that they were about to be demolished like shopping like uh yeah this commercial locals that are about to just put down and build something here okay so they give it temporarily for to the empty stores empty stores yes thank you um so K format is I mean that was not within the framework of documentation sorry is uh it's a space that different organizations in Castle or in Germany have there for two years I think something like this okay but then when documentar goes there then they they involve them of course and it is within that framework then the K format imbibed for one week create and propose different things so myself I was involved in a performance uh a telematic performance between Argentina and Castle yes that was like something that I present and you were doing visuals I was actually I was doing the inside like the the part of being in Castle which was I think I handled it through Best Practices by understanding but it's I think that's the beauty we are talking of this sometimes like when we that this idea of the best practices for me it just have helped me so far too approach life to be honest you know like how to navigate things that are happening the transverse work love family yeah that's the beauty of the sandbox your sandbox you know you can create some books for anything that you can try you can you know speculate or whatever but it's also you can take distance from something and that's uh yeah I mean I mean it's an essay like this processes I mean what that brought to me like in practical ways conceptual ways yeah I can't really mention everything yeah so I mean it's only particular like then what happened there is animal the one who proposes uh I mean animal was the one who proposed this I remember that we were here and I think I shared with you the Marlon contacted me that there was this group already but I was I was full on with other things I was really busy so I couldn't catch up with all the things that was going on because I had residency afterwards I was doing so many different things at the same time so we were we have also engines of Eternity I was doing different things so at some point I thought with my talk with Marlon he proposed that he wanted to give me money uh I mean that's my my take of one hour of conversation with him is that because they have money from near so cryptocurrency okay and they needed to give to some people uh to support artists and so Marlon talked with me and he said maybe I would like to but I was like I mean I didn't now I have a better a better understanding of what is there they're doing although not technically how really works because I have not yeah no I wouldn't say like um so you were like kind of have to like jump on the mysterious boat like but the thing is like I mean in that scene like so animal proposed I saw there was a lot of movement and I know I remember that I was here and I took some time to be in some places to read through the whole telegram then at some point was like I don't know 200 messages like to try to catch up because it was important for me to go to documentary I allocated some money because of course there was nothing paid there was just the space I have to pay my accommodation to find housing in in Castle those days which was very difficult something that I think very much uh Juan dancer from Colombia through the accident he helped me that he put me in contact with him with somebody and yeah it was otherwise I would have to pay a lot so I was in some family house in a really you know the Sovereign house like very very nice and I feel reachable with the Metro with the transport honest it was the last stop of the day of the drum it was really quiet it was super nice um but anyway so Anil anuel proposed I just read in the document at some point I need an email proposed uh telematic performances and then his speech was dancers in in some places in Argentina uh and in other dancers in in Castle in different places in Castle in documenta uh do the telematic performance we put it like that and when I read it it was like how are you gonna what are you gonna do with that when I read it already I was like is my troubles with that when I see it just a pitch and the thing is being one of the ones who worked with techno with tech I mean doing installations I know that like and also being in the place I know that I could he was asking for help there but then the people who were there and yes or they were doing their own stuff or those who were like free they could not maybe helping so much so then at some point I said okay I will help you but then I just said like at the end guys I proposed like we see I mean we rehearse something I mean some I propose I think I propose some based on what he wanted I proposed on his structure a choreographic structure uh was very simple so I think he wanted to change basically I think he proposed his choreography I think was moving between five scenes okay something like this that there were triggers somehow and also I think he wanted to code it like that like the trigger was passing from the comment that triggered something in Argentina okay but he have no idea who dancers in Castle he knew the people in Argentina because our people from his community right so he knew probably working together yes yes but then in Castle not so then at the end I said so we tested technical part and then already we saw the word with good internet on their house there was in trouble so uh I proposed to him to reduce just to three then in case there is madness and stuff then I still we understand how to improvise together and then in the place um um I did something like I with another person that I is called a Maria Elena is a is a woman it reminds me a video of Annie she should be like I don't know around her age and also she's working with something dance and Technology things always so she and knows Marlon for a long time and she lives in Berlin and and has a beautiful project with uh with the Kinect but it's so but it's beautiful because it's just it's so simple is a people pass the connect and then you see some wings okay and but the way who is portrayed it is it just is very well done so it doesn't matter like what it is it's a it's a beautiful project I think it's and I saw it also in a church so it was just like I thought like that's nice that was nice and then people engage with movement because their wings proposed a forward movement basically they move in certain way so then you would like to catch up with the movement of the Wings right so that was wonderful anyway so then she she said like I'll be there so I help you I was like oh yes so then we haven't seen each other she just arrived maybe 10 minutes before the performance and already uh before I decided with an email just trust me like and then I think we we did some q and just one instead of three cues okay because before that the agreement before was like instead of five I proposed let's do three queues so some intro the performance and closing and but then once I was in the document uh the internet was of course not working at all it was a huge lag and the sound was terrible so I had to do it with my the internet I was hot spotting to my computer yeah um then I use my I decided to use my my phone it was similar to what happened one time here because I decided to do with my phone because I didn't my computer was not working for my computer work as reference so I have my my original idea was to really use it to to record uh but it was I just use it to project in the video Beamer what was going on in general but the idea was different was to really use it but it was not working so then I decided to use the signal from my camera and my phone camera and then I will send it uh via Skype to an evil and then an email was doing things so then he could there was no dancers of course he was expecting dancers the only two dancers was paralena and me and we didn't prepare anything so there was not really too much dancing but then uh the wave I remember like because it's summer it's hot it's really hot especially at that moment it's really hot this thing is these buildings are really hot inside and then I remember with what I proposed is I just put some I did some ritual with that which yeah put some pillow and then I everybody's already started but so instead of asking for attention from everybody and said like silence and I said to just like when she arrived like I mean we say hello we didn't really talk about we're gonna do but we have like five minutes I I said to her like trust me just follow me once we start and she said she had no problem and so she gave me the truth all the trolls like okay I go and so once I I had that from her then we started and then [Music] um basically then I didn't move for a while I just sit on my knees and I was looking at them like but not in an increase I don't know I guess I was just performing yeah I was performing and and that started something that was that ended up with Marlon going in a really personal monologue that that he end up trying I remember wow that was really touching yeah yeah yeah he could speak talking from this really from all his frustrations that yeah I remember just because it was so confusing it was the performance so at some point they get they got it like and they asked me things no so Jorge and so I guess I answered them through my my my my myself at that moment we are here together um but it was very blurry it was very glitchy like so and then at some point I guess that glitchiness so I mean glitchiness in the sense it was um very everybody was very excited because I mean because of what I said the heat everything at that moment when we started already we before we were having ice cream being happy and stuff the energy was really like that so I started and they were like oh wow and like child was like oh what like what oh no and then making this joke so like very childish and at some point Marlin started dancing that's the way who we started he started like as a joke or I don't know I mean I wouldn't say that's a joke like yes you just start dancing and he get really engaged into dancing um and then he started speaking of like uh from like his like he's dancing career and stuff they love dance first right and then then he goes from there to the the personal place and then sharing all the frustrations and I also I think it was part of like being documented for he was already in Europe for like three weeks at that moment I think when that happened but so that was what we did we did that and is recorded both ends my wait no it's an evils so yeah you see computers like I I I will send you a link yeah I have to also put it in my things and it is in my in my in my notes like to find the documentation but I know because it was live stream on YouTube so it is okay it is in YouTube but it's on an evils YouTube because he was the one who was doing backing with if he was organizing everything right um but so that's that's the way who the auto so I don't know perhaps you want to move should be close or harder I mean you can go on and on but I guess it's good to keep it like one around one hour I don't know it's one hour but not less than one hour but I think it's good like this and then you know we just take time and tomorrow we talk maybe I can talk about whether yeah mostly but I think it's it's good because yeah I mean yeah like I I need to know a lot of things here from here and you have to like know what happened to me and yeah but it's uh yeah yeah it's life and that's good yeah but like once you said like you know that's that um I don't know what the comment from someone from like motion back like I don't know that uh it's like best practice or something that we can come back to like always like a like a reference or something like you know we're not doing it now I mean we're not doing practices right now but like we can always come back to it yeah yeah which yeah I think that's that's what it is yeah thank you thanks for watching thanks for watching Please Subscribe well I haven't said that for uh so long yeah I'm thinking that actually lately that I can always start uploading out some of these videos on my channel yeah okay you can compress this one and you can uh maybe we'll do it yeah yeah it'll be nice yeah I think so I don't have to log in with mine yeah because I don't have my computer for some reason good all righty so see you the next one yeah all right", "vW0kXdH3Up8": "[Music] okay okay this will be interesting we're back to GT after all this time oh I don't know so because there's um weird face what weird face tracking you're on face tracking what it's this Weird thingy you know like if you move but GT does that but oh it depends on like how you are showing the screen like you should put the gallery view and if the you know the image becomes like portrait um then you know the whole image doesn't fit and then it starts like face tracking and try to make your face in the middle Gypsy yeah I'm surprised the Gypsy does that no but I cannot see it here I can I mean but what are you seeing like like a big image of myself uh nine ten yeah there's like a like a like a button to make it Gallery like uh I think it's like a grid thingy yeah and then you see both of us hitting oh okay wow this is interesting since we started like wow three years ago already it's a long time oh no don't do that artificial intelligence against or intelligence I think billions our intelligence are dangerous and you see by the way that that's your uh ah yeah thank you it's part of his nonsense I really appreciate by the way I also with the the candies and stuff like that was right oh yeah I thought you would like it yes very much especially in those days because I was like yeah that's you know like I think Christmas around that time I still was like I just told you what the hell helping so it was really nice to have that well good afternoon um wow okay so there is a lot I was thinking even how to you know to that's why how to proceed because already I also I opened this hybrid document that we have [Music] um uh to even maybe put do we have to kind of like to put some agenda you know like where there's so many different things to talk but at the same time I thought like I don't know like whatever you know like um because I mean the thing is that it seems to me that they are important so-called important things to talk um but we'll see I guess this because now to myself like now also maybe you can just like describe to this big audience that we always have how um what because now they just arrive in Europe and he was in Colombia right oh to explain that I don't know if we don't explain to the audience between us but I haven't explained to you so like not not much not that much I don't know no we haven't been in touch so so well so yeah like no it's been crazy like you know that I did like the exchange semester right that was from that was from August to December like beginning of December by the way I got the uh the grades the what the grade are the great of your project of the the the the courses I was taking because so the grades from Colombia and the yeah yeah okay yes because here you never fail in Colombia you failed you can fail I mean it's more I guess so it's very serious you get the actually the the Nota you know the score is also and I took four classes first one is uh seminario the investigation Tres I don't know what why oh because it's a third semester and this one is four credits and it says aprobada so they didn't give you a grade this is what I I'm uh approved you approved you passed yeah yeah and the second one is and this is three grids it's also from my studio and this is 4.8 all all over five you know over five yes yeah yeah so it's good it's good it's almost perfect yes not perfect well good for someone who doesn't speak Spanish so much in English right hmm you are taking the class following the classes in English I mean both but they they do it in Spanish so you know I have to interrupt or I have to ask later but you really need some attention yeah and the test is 24 credits and this is also a probada wow this is 24 credits that's a lot of questions yeah this is the ministry that was a course that you were following it's a laboratory I think it's a laboratory but like the work in progress showing and stuff 24 credits that's a lot of credits because Mastery is just like it's it's about making your this is in the end the whole Mastery is about your testes yeah okay and the lithographia last one is three credits and that's 4.2 that's the one that you are hanging so yeah it's good actually uh as well that was that was lithography yeah what is that what does that mean lithography what is that that you have it in your wall yeah but what does it mean like cryptography lithography it's uh I mean it's the name like you have to you know work with a stone and then put the ink and you print okay it's a printing method okay that's like old analog way right so yes so that's the first part of my Colombian experience that was that was the reason why you were there yeah initially and then I extended for like two months for my project for my diploma project here at the school and that's from December like end of December to two days ago and to be honest like I didn't have any idea like what to do like I just said like because I'm not following so you were there for the exchange program from which you received these grades now right exactly and then but uh you came back for your thesis for that this is at your school to Colombia yes okay yeah that's a different thing yeah yeah and like when I planned I didn't have any idea I just said like I go to I stay in Colombia a bit longer and then yeah I'm getting a bit distracted too in the document it's okay um then I decided to go to Santa Marta that was in January and I stayed there for like three weeks no in Santa Marta like whole like more than one month I think but in the Sierra Nevada I stayed for like three weeks right and then I stayed in Bogota for a bit less than a month like three weeks to do the festival I had that you went back to do your first child so yeah I came back to January yeah and then yeah Festival um so in total how long were you in Colombia like you work for like basically you're working like half a year yeah half a year you just came to back to Europe like for 10 days or something yeah exactly yeah wow that's long there's a look of course that's a long period man that's a period yeah yeah you have time to so I'm from Colombia by the way by the way uh yeah interesting interesting yeah it would be interesting like if you go to Japan for half a year like I would be like wow wow I don't know if I want to do that Wow first like actually and it will make sense you know it will actually it will make absolute sense I am really curious to to see like I mean if you can start like making some speculation or not even a speculation but not from a yeah uh uh uh how it's called when you yeah documentation I guess but that's not the word that I'm searching like for instance because say in a way like oh formally or like something that uh yeah I I think I mark this in our pad also it's one of these Milestones is um is my graduation uh from my school because my Pro in my school that I just finished last year I took us a final work uh best practices so I did from the point of view of the school best practices so I put it within the framework of a bachelor multimedia and communication technology of the uh on University of applied sciences so basically a place where people have yeah it's more labor forced in my own words the how is the Academy of who is my school is almost like labor force that they are building towards web Technologies I think in short there is not too much space for I mean whether they consider about what is artistic it would be what uh you can think about design it's about uh applied creativity towards solving problems to not go more deep into this so it's not liberal arts at all um so what I was mentioning this because uh my graduation project I have 19 points out of 20. um and now if I'm really curious to see like somehow in this speculation that uh um that I will will be curious to see how are your great cells in your school uh because although the the I mean I'm assuming also also because from things that you're seeing and things that I share with you the things that you do in a way are resonance and uh from our path decisions that you're taking uh I mean aesthetic decisions uh from my interpretation things that I perceive uh it are Resonance of our path and I also I can say through my own uh in my own practices within completely different Frameworks uh I think we have discussed in different times that I think with best practices in a way because it's so fluid it's in one hand very difficult to to make it performative in different Frameworks uh to make it functional for different Frameworks like uh yeah it's difficult to make it performative but on the other hand also it's more like a like an umbrella thing that I started receiving more like the way how one can perceive almost life if you want to see um so yeah anyway so I was mentioning this because then I I'm curious to see that uh to see what are the grades of your do you have the grades of Naruto's Festival not yet no I mean I'm I'm finishing my thesis like in the next days which is like impossible so I will frame it as a work in progress edition of my thesis but yeah um so the in terms of the grade I think what I can only get is like I don't know what the right term for it but you can be like a kind of this notable student you know but they don't make a score you can so you cannot lose you can what are like the how is how do the grades work in your school no like so if you are approved if you get the diploma if someone is really good then you know you can have this like uh not honor how they say it like yeah something like that yeah but by the way there's no worried from my school with my receiver diploma is hilarious diploma yeah so yeah that's that's that there is no score I think it will be funny if I fail but there will be all this is like that's part of like I guess my critique that now I guess is getting more I understand a bit more of my critique like uh I guess when we start when we start meeting oh my God that's driving me crazy like the movement it starts oh crazy um when we met with Naruto like at the beginning when we started having this open chats uh actually here no I mean like this this link oh yeah right um then what I remember then so we started sharing things and one of the things I was sharing was like this um yeah I was feeling annoyed by um how like in art you have to really be really bad in academies to lose like to have to lose a subject uh you really have to I mean or not go to even for class maybe or to not show up like while in a school uh like technical school when you're learning skills say coding skills you're really easy kind of just I mean starting from just counting off when you show up in classes but also in terms of like knowledge basically you can prove really easy do you know how to do this or you cannot and I I remember that back then I was already reflecting I guess my position was a bit more hard like now I think I'm more soft but because already I graduate and I have also more time to think reflect on being in other Frameworks include art and Sciences and yeah structural actually in a structural level thinking of of knowledge and systems modeling and that's something that I'm busy now um so I guess yeah I'm just just to say this that um I always I found quite easy in a way like in terms of Labor like because they're somebody who can overwork also you know uh co-art yes yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah because it's not quantifiable so you don't know why to stop let me let me like I finish with this the other hand also uh it is I guess the uh the possibility for achieving a grade you know totally right yeah so like yeah this is like something I found interesting at the school in uh so the the in Colombia like what I just said the grades but basically the first three courses are from the maestria the Masters in uh theater and Performing Arts and the last one is like the from this uh the plastic card Fine Art which is always funny to say that in Spanish you said like Fine Arts is like artist Plastics like when I was like exchanging for the first time like these words with people in English because they're almost offended like a plastic person yeah yeah plastic is also like funny or it has like so many different meanings I mean it has different meanings that goes like there's so many different ways anyways um yeah I mean in both ways like in lithography like in this plastic Arts I think they really like have a lot of assignments and you know it's it's so hard to keep and keep up with the class because who is applied right it's a craft it's a workshop yeah so it's uh you have assignments you have to make things done by the deadline they ask for so many things which I didn't finish but uh like I think because I have artistic talents because you're Japanese and you are in Colombia Maybe well yeah I mean that will add like maybe 0.3 uh points but um yeah so that's that's what I found is interesting like here in in Germany like things are so relaxed of course like there are some assignments that you have to do you have to read you have to you know submit like a essay in the end for some classes but you know it's it's nothing really like I mean it's it's not hard I don't want to say it this way but like they don't challenge you so we can be very lazy or we can just like you know work on your own wow that's so that's that's very important that's really important so if you want to study in Colombia or in Germany it's a good uh good reference and also in the Masters in theater that's also like you know they don't like specifically ask you for like like a specific thing but you have to like you know come up with like new things every week you have to be yeah you have to set your own assignments basically and uh but in the end like you have to work hard um make sense of your nonsense and to prove that yeah I mean here it's the same like you have to yeah do things but you can still get credits if you don't do things here I think so that's like a big difference yeah yeah I just wanted to add that to what you said I mean there are different ways to work in arts I think to relax yeah but I was thinking now to the is that it should come from I don't know is I mean it's just the the way home the places are positioned and within the world I think so um um saying that the fact that you can take the time also to really I mean to be no you know to take your time and to not be pushed in certain ways it responds to I mean uh did you have economical capacities to do it as a in a structural level I think um true uh although also that I think has not absolutely true because in the States you think like then nobody is not true like in the sense of like I don't want to stay here too long as but is that you have um I think in Europe we have more a social system like in in the way who the social classes are they're not so divided as in a place like Colombia or in America also then you have all these Peaks you know like constantly from block to block then you have uh and I remember really in Italy that you have uh people passing from building to building helicopters while you see the favelas at the back so this is like one of the images that I remember the most in this extreme thing that I'm trying to share that in Europe you don't have so much extreme the extreme is no so best um um say uh wait so yeah so that was the point that I was trying to make that it is so culturally somehow the things are structured somehow uh uh in a way that is more the system takes care more of you so in why in one hand than if you don't want you don't have to push yourself and it's fine but also if you push yourself there is not too much you can profit from it you see what I mean like in Colombia for instance like if you don't and I learned that from Mom from Mom that that since I was a small because I saw my my mom she was working as a secretary while she was studying at night and she had three kids right so then I and she I saw that from her that she was saying that basically if you stop doing something first like the person that you are studying with is your competence right away and I mean these are things that my mom was telling me under I guess 10 years old I'm telling you like during all my childhood so that was one thing and the other thing was that uh yeah basically like the underline and then that of Education how does it matter education in a place like Colombia because it's a privilege so I come from a family that I know that we can afford to get some education then you should do it because there's a big difference between if you have education or if you don't have education in terms of the money that you earn right say a mechanic in in Colombia or a graphic designer in Colombia they they earn way way the the unbalancing the amount of money that they have the income is way uh bigger than in Belgium maybe will be even maybe they hardly will sometimes can be even more paid a mechanic because of the hard label might get more paid at that graphic designer it's a completely different part they can in in the way how the societies values assigned literally the economic value so I mean all this is to say and then to wrap up this idea is that um is the system that provides the possibility uh for you to relax basically yeah if there are no economic conditions you cannot relax you have to keep on going and the system will show you that if you don't keep on going you're out right and it's the same like when you like that's about education but also like when you become an artist like here you get grants and do whatever you want and there it's not the same right I mean it's completely opposite where oh yeah I mean that's the thing that's the other thing or you get famous and then you get extra yeah like a stinging reach you know like uh that's that's the extreme that we are talking right so you don't make it or you make it and it's the same in Japan like in Colombia like because there's not much like Public Funding or Public Funding like they always pay uh they always spend money for like commercial projects companies in terms of like art funding like cultural funding which is a shame like they don't support much um for the individual artist Independent Artists but in the other hand I think it's like it's so value there's so much value the the fact that we say that if you're saying that there is some similarities in the wake of the society Works in Japan and in Colombia then there's so much value so much things that you can use when you are in places like in Belgium or in Germany because you have that information like I have this conversation like I'm living in Belgium for I think uh been more than 13 years now and maybe early my first second year I was talking with Nicolas a friend who lives in in Spain for I think could be almost 20 years now a friend of mine who is like super Highly Educated like yeah anyway um and we were talking of this idea of what the that you have that information you know of like all these extremes because we were coming from medium-high class I guess in Colombia and then we have access to really poor people even within your family I guess or really people with yeah Rich I guess or with good money uh images within uh close families or family or close to our families and therefore just the way who you have to learn to use your language the Spanish how to communicate with the with the different people along the the stairs the society stair is very different and then you just learn to do it um it's just it's a normal thing I guess it's just a skill as a language skill but if you really put it more the scope um there are so many basically you because of the society is so complex you get to be very fluid in the uh in to in the way to interact with different people because there is so much different people that you have to deal in terms of like safety I mean almost in safety you know like then you you know if you get to some places sometimes I guess maybe you explore in Colombia or in other places that you maybe sometimes get to certain situations but you know that you need to get to access certain language in order to position yourself as to let know the other person like hey I'm not any kind of Gringo I know what is going on you know like please don't cross this line and then find your way to get out of the situation or something like that um I have experienced things like that for instance in Brazil but I mean just can't imagine that perhaps happened to you or something I'm not trying to bring something a specific example but what I'm saying is to bring this idea of the just the amount of like uh because the way who we grow up you have these things since you are small so you have this in your embodied knowledge you don't think about it you just you know how to deal with different kind of people yeah yeah like you know that I in my poster I wrote El Chino Rocco yeah yeah I I don't want to go to detail right now but uh yeah that's something also like it's different type of you know situations but that I have to deal with and sometimes I have to be uh clown like that you know right like how like can can you maybe go a bit more deep into that well the name itself came from uh like it was like a joke that I was talking with uh Colombian guy so he was saying that his sister's partner is from Kali but he's I don't know if their parents or like half uh Japanese and in Kali everyone calls him El Chino but he's Japanese I mean Japanese Colombian yeah which is like you know that kind of typical situation so he was joking that like if I stay in the Sierra Nevada for some time then everyone's everyone's gonna call me El Chino and but that's you know like he knows like he's educated and he knows that all these like complicated situations but of course like if I walk on the street sometimes people try to say you know this uh you know this difficult thing like you try to imitate uh Chinese you know the Mandarin I I don't do it but like that's kind of like I don't know if they do it from kind of like to to for like uh to intimacy or like like being friendly or just trying to uh trying to annoy me or whatever like an insult I don't know but anyways of course I don't feel good about it right of course yeah of course yeah but of course like at the same time like there's no point to fight you know no so yeah like sometimes uh like I would just smile but that's kind of like the attitude that I have to have like I have to be calm and I have to but know that even though I feel like insulted badly I have to be nice and there was like also like this weird situation like when I was like in the Sierra or in taiwana there's like one guy I think he's Colombian he came to me and like he asked me like where I'm from then I said I'm from Japan like it was in Spanish and he said something like you know like I couldn't hear it but like like can you say blah blah blah in Chinese and I was like I I I almost said like you know and then I said you know like I was I just you know smiled at him and I said I am Gino Loco so he was really happy about it yeah but like that's really like you know that's you see like I think that it's just making me I just make an analogy I don't know if you're gonna make sense like I hope it makes sense like at some point when I was 15 years old or something I mean my mom at some point I think she kind of started realizing that I was smoking weed and then I was like I because I was really into philosophy and like really into just like understanding the world and you're like these and then I was trying to get into my mom and trying to make her understand that it was like a you know just like tobacco you know and my mom is really Christian we were raised up as Christians going every Sunday to the church um when I move say maybe back uh when I'm maybe 22 23 I'm not living with my mom anymore then at that point already I understood there was no point for I mean I was not living with my mom I was really into my artistic living my art team I was studying in La Sabo it was like a dream come true to pass like all this constraint it was like oh wow the dream has come true so I was not really living at a house I I saw her not too much so I thought there was no point for me to try it when I uh to talk about these things with my mom try to make her understand my point of view right I just thought like for me was more important just to share time with her and if she had to say from time to time something bad that I was not uh or about gay people or something because she was really Christian um I was just like not interested in engaging of that kind of dialogue I'm just making out the analogy of what you're saying then you're just all right let me see although you get a fan although you inside you get offended or touch it to more or less extent you get offended right yeah I see yeah because it's not about like judging them because of their standpoint or Viewpoint I think there are two different things like I mean sorry about that I guess that would interrupt you but in the way why series is like in a way it's like you have one the I guess could be more the you can go into a political sphere like really trying to think rationally what's what is the situation about but in the other hand you cannot avoid like to just uh be with embodied situation which carry all your persona you know like you feel because you feel without going too deep into that you are like that at that moment you're coming from certain place so it's your body is telling you something that of course is in negotiation with your head and your experiences but I'm trying to separate the exercises this is really interesting because I think the performance I did was about it like it's about like it's I am telling the story by the way I spoke I was speaking in Spanish for like 50 minutes did you record that did you have recorded the performance I even recorded with uh not yet because I have like a recording with my sound recorder like Zoom sound recorder to have nice sound although it was raining a lot and it's like a a bit sketchy theater that like you hear the sound of the rain hitting the roof but with the with the sound recording I think it's super nice but I just have to synchronize it with the video and um so yeah I will upload it sometime I mean actually I have one recording that I think I already synchronized more or less so I can send it to and um yeah it's it's about that like you know I tell about my story where I'm from where I studied I came to Colombia and like talks through but also like it's not about the story you know like it's about like what I embody and like what I carry so I of course I make this fun uh of myself saying it's El Chino Loco but that's you know but that's just part of it I mean it's not about like rationally understanding like where I'm from what I do what I think but it's like showing like putting out like what I embodied like what's the movement I had here and there like in Japan in Canada in tyruna and then yeah like people would just receive it you know it's not about like yeah it's it's about the experience like sharing the experience of like embodiment let's say like the thing is I mean in in um I think it's about I mean I will put it in words of that's about sharing vulnerability you know basically you're just saying like you're confronting yourself with like this is this is something I don't know what is it but it is there I'm sharing this with you exactly so rather and I think that's a great something that we we do uh in not rationally but as well we do like in a way this is like very specific case where basically you don't know what is going on with that maybe also you're not constantly really interested in solving that but then you find that exchange space as something interesting so it's like you know you know you know what this is something that connects you and me because you give them an entry point you know El Chino Loco right so you give them an entry point of communication so people will it will be you can imagine this as a slash if somebody starts singing uh Katy Perry song or this kind of things these pop things this pop things that Martin uses in his choreographies are entry points for people to connect directly nothing else to think about it it's just like a it's an interface for for uh yes an interface for uh something for affection for different certain uh modalities of affection yeah and it will be different in both from both ways from the audience as the performer but that they are not they are entangled they cannot happen without the other one they are interconnected they cannot exist without the other one in that case in that specific case it's actually interesting because like I thought a lot about care like there's a lot of like like I talk all the time and I move but also like there's always like I look at the audience and I think I try to like make references that they would understand that's like of course but also like for example like I I didn't ask anyone about the feedback about this part but in the middle like I talk in Japanese for like one minute or so um that's like something I wanted them to kind of like it's not like very confront but like just to feel like how it is like someone talking in like other language that you don't understand which is like for me when I come to with my arrived in Colombia like or like Germany or Canada whatever that they speak something that I don't understand or I maybe I learned a bit but still I don't catch but when I speak in Japanese like at the same time like I use like imported words so that like it's not like completely gibberish but maybe you can get something out of it that you connect and that's like something like I want to make this tension but in a funny way like always like I try to make it like because of kind of entertainment it's not entertainment but something that people can you know laugh at because I know that a lot of people work with the identity it's always heavy it's good you know like it's it's something needed you know nothing I'm not saying that everything has to be funny but to me like I think like you said about entry point I think it's nice to be like funny and then like also makes people think you know so what is it it's not just like haha and that's it but it's funny it's funny now that you're saying I mean I haven't seen your performance but it's really um it's funny because like the performance I did with the evolution dance was basically in the description is very similar I basically I just got and I the line of that I present is an immigrant who is coming to give a speech so basically my The Story of My Life how I end up basically at the importance at that moment because around that time you were like interested in like creating your work about like identity at that moment basically it was it was right before I get to Buffalo Martin is that that was the last I mean I was I guess exhausting my dance career but I didn't know I was a star just to start exploring the choreographic aspect so I didn't know I uh one element that it was coming through things that I was seeing was this idea of dramaturgy uh it and then Evolution was a reference of this I'm talking about 2017 I think and so there was this possibility to do this workshop with him and then [Music] which was a very bizarre process also because there were this selection process and these these things and the people who were there were such a Divas and they were really they were there were there were big names on uh solid performers back then as performers like a lot of people from the states uh anyway for me all this thing was completely new uh I didn't know and also but somebody let me know uh uh somebody Paul Gomez uh so what is a really close friend of mine that now lives in the States was a clown and he was studying at the school there's a very particular School of a clown in Switzerland Dimitri school is called is a very particular school I have never been there but it is like a small house and it just has a a huge religion in clown um anyway so he was there and evil is our regular teacher there yeah let me check I don't know if he still does it and so Paul took that workshop with him so Paul so they know each other already yeah yeah he knew what was he Paul told me because I told him in the said I told him that I was going to do it and Paul told me like I remember he told me like don't worry uh he's gonna be late really late don't worry be calm and don't ask just follow up that was the only thing he said to me I have so many questions but he said like don't worry he will be late really late just follow up and as that's what I did like the first day we were these people and then it's like half an hour one hour I think he was late like maybe I think the workshop is about five hours per day or something he was like maybe almost two three hours so like at the beginning people are just arriving half an hour people some people start complaining and finding also what is going on to communicate with the office like different uh strategies to to sense the space uh that's because you're paying like actually good money for that right sorry Workshop you pay good money for the workshop I mean people depends on like if they have funding or whatever but yeah yeah but normally yeah if you have to pay you have to pay quite some money they should yeah yeah there could be some money like like maybe a thousand Euros could be yeah 500 euros at least I think um but then so of course like there was a lot of people from this or uh dance web or or Atlas right and yeah yeah so then then anyway so in short uh it just ramp it up until he arrived he just he he said he he spoke maybe for less than one minute to be honest he said like he sits he didn't say anything he didn't say I'm sorry for being late he just sits uh because everybody in the space they are yeah it's just so bizarre just after three hours of waiting this character and also EU is very strange person uh so then he just arrived he sees he says take a paper and he waits and he spends I don't know I guess I would say maybe it was less than five minutes he said like he started writing some a story about your mother about like he said three things he's playing everything we have to do in five minutes and he was really almost aggressive like you got it it was not really complicated but it's just the frame where it's really what are you at why do you ask to do this right now so I didn't ask I just took the notes I have to do this and I follow up the process anyway five days after I think we start like maybe 15 or I will say 15 at the end the last day we were just four people and just three people present a solo and [Music] and I think so I I was one of the ones who present uh and he was really harsh he was really really harsh in the comments live with people that's why people didn't came back because he was just like in his way just was being honest and from his point of view he was a teacher there he was saying this is just nonsense nonsense is no no no no no no and he was giving really concrete feedbacks so for people who have been already with practices in Performing Arts like with their own Persona uh it most of them they just left and it's like this is just these guys just really aggressive ignorant of different things uh in my case was the opposite like that I think to be being honest maybe maybe it could be like two performances who in a way were good that he was giving you using the performance a good example and as a positive thing so my performance is like he was very happy and then he was speaking about it and the whole performance was just it happened in that way the narrative was just somebody who comes to the space with a lot of different things that I guess in me like carrying all these different things always like so confused always um and then I have different flags of a Brazilian flag and Croatian flag and different things and then I said like really in English really clear like I come to tell your story like and then I and then I start uh mixing between Netherlands English and Spanish and and then constantly saying like uh okay but before this I have to do something and then I go to some place in the stage and then I start developing a uh some movement the movement the yeah so movement uh anyway uh that are funny actually I guess but they are they're really concrete choreographic tasks I guess like I saw you also killing yourself like doing this thing often that it gives it's so iconographic you know uh because of you and the thing the gesture is very strong it gives a lot of space for people to jump on that and just do whatever they want with information so I was doing things like that also I guess uh yeah anyway so I and I think I I hope like I see this like that I think I recorded performance but with how many cameras sorry I think I hope I recorded performance but if not there is because there was Juan that you know Juana so in that path I met Juana also in the impossence she was by chance also there uh ah because she was uh yeah I heard the story that she was there because of a co-amrogacy Jorge is the choreographer and she was there basically uh she danced for jorgeous I don't know if you met Jorge no in Colombia I think so Jorge is a choreographer we study all together and then ASAP and he was the one who actually was invited uh Jorge dances for the Japanese artist before okay um and anyway Jorge Jorge saw the performance that I did uh Jorge was part of the public and I'm not sure no Juana was in there but there was this thing called that I don't know if I still exists Indiana was called room pools dance it's something that it happens parallel and that you have the room pulls dance is like to give an alternative option to the impulse dance and Institution um so it's one night of performances that they are just on C2 on spot who wants to come they have some like 15 minutes to prepare in the common stage and we did a performance with Juana uh because I invited her there she came and then we just came up let's just do a performance and we did a performance and I'm sure that performance is recorded and that performance it is on my YouTube channel so I can share that with you for sure um because it comes with that energy the the decisions that because I guess most of the decisions are I was there to say there are more from my part proposing something to wanna um uh and I are coming from this place of sharing with evil image have that specific uh framework right but it is something that it is very similar to I mean the way how you describe your performance uh yeah the actions that I proposed in my solo were also I guess it makes sense as a structure but if you isolate the things also it's just like certain like what are you doing it's like nonsense you know let me see yeah I'm really curious I think I can find it if it's on YouTube well actually like so like the next thing I'm thinking is like I don't think I will do this performance here um for various reasons I don't want to dance and um but also like it's quite long and like I don't want to ask people to watch how long was it 50 minutes 50 okay yeah yeah like it's not something you know I just sent the link to someone and watch and I started to think like because I'm starting a new project like a website thingy and what about like breaking this performance into like different pieces and somehow like laying out on the website which is which sounds probably like the emotion Bank thingy so like I think I didn't get it like in yeah can you expand a bit more of this because I didn't understand so do you know like motion Bank like uh Deborah hay or uh Jonathan boros like the the projects like like a lot of like Snippets and you can click on it and you can see the references I mean right actually like for that then I did most of the job um but I mean motionbank provides the platform and she works on like you know connecting like different ideas she has to go through like 100 videos and um make the references but I'm thinking like I want to do something like very similar in terms of interface but the difference is that I do it as the Creator of the performance so that I have like I it's not like something to analyze the project but I want to be like opinionated about like where this is coming from what is like connected to what it could be like you know connected also the best practices like like footages from best practices or something else and just make um Montage of everything so that is part of the story is this part you send me a link about an air table this air table is connected with some of this idea that you have or is it different no this airtable is just like uh I was like looking through like so yeah like forget about them like 100 things because this one yeah forget about it just like maybe just finish this because I get it another question then because maybe it could be in that direction yeah you send me a link of these images in a website that they are hyperlinked to different places that's you remember there is a website there's a lot of words there is one specifically I think should be about Naruto's Festival let me check very because we we haven't I could speak my project yeah it's a soup soup I think it's called soup no but it's soup yes soup uh yeah I think should be the soup it's hard to like and then you start going and then one image will yes exactly that one yeah yeah yeah so the question is well with uh what what is the framework of that one uh so it's the same uh like funding wise it's the same framework like this one was like a kind of online residency for two months that uh all the videos stopped so I I lost your attention yeah so it's like two-month funding for doing like something at home and and that's part of like that was part of the back thing or not I mean we applied it together but I mean yeah it's a little bit complicated they're like supporting but like in a like partially supporting let's say so but this is a project that so you did this project with with who so you because you said we I don't know I mean I I did I mean with the packed but they are like kind of ins like because the institution has to support for the application yeah like it's more like a reference so is so this this uh this soup project is within the framework of Pact well it's like a state funding and then we like packed and I applied together I mean tax acts need to apply together okay okay okay okay so it's like that's because that's part of like this one we you were in path at some point you have this call from pack it's part of this that was like when it started and it took like it took more than a year to figure out no one year I think yeah so and now these are like two months funding project that you have yeah and I got it again I mean they asked me to do it again so I'm doing starting in a few days in March hopefully my thesis is done by then and I start this project and I'm thinking about like uh I proposed like something I mean something vague so I'm trying to think like putting this performance like cutting this video into pieces screenshots and connect to like different things but like it's more about like centered around this performance like right so it's like a soup but it's diff like from different uh material yeah okay okay now that's why I was mentioning the soup absolutely it makes sense yeah yeah no it makes sense yeah and actually this let's say this soup was like the something that became like a structure for my performance because it's like hyperlink of like my memories like where I'm from and what's connected to what you know like for example like I do like Aikido movements in my performance and then that's connected to the contact improvisation and such and that's like like during the process of like connecting different things some air table I started to see these like lines everywhere and then I that made me like structure the performance when I did in November and then I did uh like a different version last week last week well it's great one in November was the one that you did at the at the the maestria yeah yeah that you put the uh that you make you send me that you know when you have this um kawajetes to put the paintings the easels yeah yeah yeah [Music] yeah yeah so this is the the performance you did now the last week was a second version of this performance made based on it but it's also like half of it as like a new material because something I wanted to do from the experience in Sierra yeah so yeah okay so it has to be also with your experience in La Sierra yeah all right maybe we should close here and then maybe just like we go back to Backstage and then next level yes so oh thank you for watching thanks now I mean by the way like one of the persons who is checking often our videos by the way that she said that she knows you like I didn't know she knew her name is Lily ah okay he is somebody who she has she has so many qualifications and now she she studied she did the past she also did the Masters in arts uh she did the Masters in Parts I remember because I met her so first she has a I think a masters in physics and then she started then she started working with dance if I understand very well because she I'm I'm quite sure maybe at some point she will watch this dreaming about you she's one of the person who's been watching this so and she was part of this important yeah I won't ask you yeah actually so then wait because I was like short too much but she does because it's very interesting and now she's in Cologne so is that so she's coming from physics I think mostly in physics and then she I don't know how she ended up working with dance then she went to a pass to do the pass cycle and then once you finish the pass she decides to do a masters in parts which I found that was very strange personally speaking because normally I mean the past is what I will consider and I think is considered as a pre -doctorate pre-psd and if you go more in that scale of like thinking I guess", "3cUerOrSY1M": "and then I change uh it's been a while I use zoom fortunately Gallery yes that works but hey man what up it's Colombia yeah are we publishing this are we not publishing this but it's gonna happen with this well I was I was about to propose like I thought maybe we just make it public and we just talk about you know updates and what's practical things and then at some point when we just be closer yeah if we talk about our illegal business or whatever okay illegal business exactly I thought it's like more than 40 minutes but it says 14 minutes so because it's the so I I saw it you're not using the your school's account right this is your private account really I thought it's a school's account it says Naruto's private account Oh shoot that's why yeah that's why yeah okay so I failed it's fine like I think we'll see if after four minutes we don't finish them yeah look what I got oh wow how did you get it I it took me a while because I was from time to time you know just checking but then I found one I mean at the end I ended up paying until but I mean with the delivery close to 70 euros yeah which was okay because I was searching it was close to 200 Euros yeah that's what I thought yeah yeah so when I found it I bought it in America for 40 euros but anything cost 30 Euros to send it from I see America because it's heavy now yeah but that's not bad I think but so now it's really cool it's interesting yeah and yeah how how is it with you man like you're just coming back from the app were you in Taiwan and where were you exactly I mean this uh cozy apartment where I um took over from um a friend Emilio he's from the school maestria and he's going back to Mexico for a month so he's submitting with me for one month perfect yeah after that in one month you're going back to Germany yeah okay and then so our decision are you doing you're so then you're doing you're not doing the semester at the end and the no I will catch up with people and I'll do random things but uh the thing was like there's a lot of things uh happening but basically in the maestria this is the last semester for them like fourth one and basically they are what did you what did you say didn't hear you what so the maestria of the uh the uh Performing Arts they are finishing this semester and they're doing the showing in August and basically because you just jump into one semester of that minus three years yeah so that's like the third one like the second year I did the third one and I was hoping to do the last one so I can kind of finish with them that was the idea but then it's a bit tricky because they are going to be working on the final showing so there is like only one uh seminar it's about writing and which can be interesting but wait so I did to understand the context so you are so there is this thing called Mastery of artists Artis biwas or something like that right and this exists since when exists this program long time ago sometimes it's not a new thing it's not a new thing right no it's been a while I think and basically it's like a two-year program it's a master they only have like a call every two years ah okay so they they they're not taking people every semester okay so they are finishing this year and then the next one starts in August uh so they're finishing the two-year cycle in when in July and June or when so that's also like the I had to consider because the semester ends in June I think February March April yeah I think it's in June so if I apply for the semester then I can stay here until June or maybe July I don't know but their showing will be in August make the final showing uh so then you will in case you will opt to stay then and you will have problems exactly I can't just stay and then finish like I have to come back again somehow or you know apply for something else or something but that's a bit strange because I mean they cannot somehow make a paper that it says that you will be studying but presenting in August is not working like that no because that's also like a bit of a problem with maestria because it's kind of like um it's not a private business but it kind of works like separately like independently from the school the natural it is from the universal National winner from your university the the university so it's not it's not part of the universe University the national as aimed as one thing well it's part of the program but they are like self-organized in a way so they hire their teachers on their own so they have their budget for the maestria and they pay for the teachers and I think there are like two three professors who's teaching at the nacho and also teaching at masliya but others are like hired they're like Freelancers and is the in and the place is within the university the campus or it depends but uh we have a space a salon uh for the midterm that's the name of the program maestria uh that Masters interdisciplinary theater and arts artists leave us whatever so we have a studio like a very nice Studio actually um but uh yeah other than that like things are taking place there but also in different places one of the seminars we did last semester was like we were like walking in the city foreign but I don't know if is that legal now in Colombia because I think that before I mean when I was there that was illegal okay well they were they are they were they are but I mean they're nice people they are the nice ones I mean like yeah procedures I think should be nice people but like it's just people but they just do a job with this yeah that's what they do yeah so anyways like so yeah like the the program is like really open but at the same time like really tight with the budget so I can't just jump in because this last semester is about creating their last uh performance which was like Michael in the show yeah and they like each student will have their director which teacher or lecturer and they're paid for you know every student yeah so I can't just join that's that's what they say that's what they told me uh you mean that if you cannot just join like you have to really inscribe yourself for them to allocate you some budget otherwise you I mean you can just get paid basically yeah yeah you just need to pay for the semester yeah yeah and the last semester was okay because uh we had this uh similar um process but as a laboratory so it's like a group of people and then we say it's a laboratory where we do like work in progress and we had two into teachers in that so we have discussions and feedback and stuff but now it's like more like one-on-one so it's a little bit more difficult and then like I was like okay so if I can't do it and I have to like you know try something along here then I would just go back to Germany and then because I have uh my uh final showing or exhibition or whatever for the school in Germany in July in July yeah so I would rather prepare for that and I will find other opportunities to come back here somehow which I think there are some well at least I know there one there's one funding that I can apply so I need to check so I can yes apply and then like apply with me for that or apply hire me I need to go there yeah true no it's like I don't know if that funding is for like multiple people but I wanted to talk about another thing there's like um it's not official yet but I might do a residency in Japan but like remotely and there's a small budget and I think that's nice for us to do something together like in the in that Terrain in that I think I would do like yeah I will do like propose a lot of things and one of them could be the best practices yeah cool but that's just yeah um it's it's coming yeah man like the best practice is like to meet you like because I start like I mean apart my personal things so I I after I finished the we did this media lab in in September in Madrid yeah with Joe and we do uh so Peter and nothing so uh we hired two people from sita's developer team or they were deploying the application and then working on the hardware actually but there was one one that was really intense in that placement I was like so I came after that it was very intense it was but at the end we have something very nice like so we have an API and people basically can use I can connect my device and like uh because before I'll remember like when we presented in arts Electronica when you were there we have this local time ago yeah yeah uh that's already like two years ago September will be two years yeah in this system yeah it doesn't feel that one one year and a half but yeah it's not that long but yeah you know but we did a lot of projects after that so so wait so then the so then that project was that it was using this local network and yeah um we were working then with the mqtt protocols and and yeah but so in this case what like the main thing of the project was to make it to have an API basically like you can connect and use the use the data uh I'm from endpoints and that's what we did at the end and create a new devices so we managed to do that but the whole process was very tiring yeah that's like a real development right yeah but also not only that like I didn't like count like for instance because I was the person who was speaking in Spanish right I used to speak Spanish also so in like I didn't I mean already I knew more or less that it will demand certain things for me so even in the contract I have with you I before I I put I said I'm not your assistant I'm not your personal translator or this I put it in a paper uh and we talked of that before but I didn't count that that would take a toll on me uh like yeah so that was tiring for different reasons yeah in Japan yeah yeah like working with the artists from Canada and the dancer from Japan and I was just there to help so I didn't Define anything and in the end I was like you know translating you know interpreting and it's a lot and I also developing so that was like but it feels super like in my experience for instance that one of the things is that so uh like practical speaking it was a mess because media labe Madrid is like a slaughtered house so it was a huge thing where they have different like hangers and so the media lab was before working I think in museum Reina Sofia right they had like a nice display before like yeah they have like super nice slaves uh yeah it was it is really famous and we were looking forward to go there but then I think we were I don't know if maybe perhaps we were the first artists who have like a residence yeah hey so we're wearing this transition period and we go there in a space that is called matadero uh and that they have like let's say maybe a lab have all their equipments 3D printers anything that you can imagine that we could use like the alphablock you know and we bought we the project needs to work with the Fab Lab like our project endorsement yeah exactly yeah but like yeah yeah because you guys still have all this we just need an open Fab Lab like a big fable about uh and and that was part of the project that was part of why we apply because the project was built up with that Spirit but then there everything was packed and they could not open it so then so we have a lot of problems but anyway like to make sure this then then really fast at some point one of the person who was in charge told us that the presentation has to be in Spanish uh and that was so I mean I didn't agree with that with Joe before but I said okay already I think thing was from the first first week or second week and I thought okay I can do the presentation in Spanish although I was that was on my compromise right but I can do the presentation in Spanish but other things like uh I mean that was my compromise but that's it um by the way I I was the compromiso means different in English the compromise is more like you know you make kind of agreement yeah but like it's more like a contribution or like a commitment that's the word commit a commitment yeah um yeah but it works like it works in both ways now compromise means the very specific in English it's not commitment compromise is like when you talk about something and I kind of have to make compromise like okay like I don't know like I want to dance but if you if we need to make some kind of program okay I make a compromise that okay yeah like so the people meet in between like yeah exactly yeah yeah in Spanish again using the same house yeah yeah I I I I know it's but also in Spanish it's like commitment like not not that way about agreement but I do something but anyway in the context that I'm saying yeah so what I'm trying to say is Joe it's like compromise or yeah not with them because it was more with the with organization like okay institution more like I will do because they I guess they if we have to do things in between like another two presentations with other people of course yeah I will do the last one yeah but it is like with the TV crew crew and other things but the other two presentations in between that's all like don't push me to do this in Spanish and like so I didn't and I mean I just said I will do the last one and I didn't reply on other things right but anyway so then is um [Music] the presentation was in Spanish and what was just difficult like uh we had between like say it would be just like a simple if I will be just in Belgium let's say yeah somebody comes somebody who speaks Spanish a friend of mine like yeah yeah a friend of mine who will ask me in Spanish things what I do I used to speak on my of my work in English right so then I will have problems here in Belgium with my friends who speak Spanish was like a more accommoluted thing yeah because you're in between and yeah because it really fast you get into I mean you cannot or it's difficult to avoid your personal uh uh traumas or whatever is the problems that you have here with identity and things so then I was feeling a bit bad or thinking what maybe the people will think that I'm arrogant because I don't speak Spanish or like this kind of things while I'm in a direct conversation with somebody you know I'm talking about something practical and at the same time I'm then I'm kind of judging my action I see no but I think I I found this is like interesting because in the Mysteria like sometimes um teachers they they speak like really affluent English one of them like even studied in Boston or somewhere in the US but then like if they want to like really give feedback they have to speak in Spanish so it's like an opposite way from you in a way and I found it's really interesting because they could speak they could say something in English but they prefer to say it in Spanish and rather like have someone translate for me or something like that yeah yeah yeah no it makes sense it makes sense but um will be fun like let's go to I like this do we have to go we have to go to Japan now you have to go to Japan uh if the war is not ending before uh that happens cool let's see if it ends that's the end which we um yeah we go to Japan in the mountains and like spend like without electricity for like a few weeks how was wait tell me about the experience like so wait so what did you did so I talked with you like did you pass New Years in in tairona or somewhere there uh no actually no I was in Santa Marta but like more in the city and then so there were like a few friends from here from the maestria they were so Juana right Juana was there to um so we actually went together um huana and uh Andrea so Andrea's partner Jose is he's like slippery he's a really cool person um he actually owns this um coffee brand s so he's doing like a plantation in the Sierra Nevada coffee and cacao so he has a connection that he's been working with the indigenous families there so they proposed to like go together so Andrea Jose Juana and her partner like we all went to Sierra Nevada and we spent like a few days there how many days were you there that one I think only like four four days and then after that I went to tairona for like a volunteering in Hostel that was for like two weeks I think in the end so that's where you were until now I mean that usually exactly yeah yeah yeah yeah and how was the experience oh I mean we're still like trying to like articulate and still like you know coming back to the city life I think yeah but basically like there's no electricity you know like um in the hostel they have the the solar cells so they can charge phones but like not much and there's no like not really like a good internet connection you have to walk a little bit I'm actually surprised that even they have internet wait but so what about like the the four days that you stayed at the other community I mean indigenous Community yeah and they're they're I guess I mean do did they have internet no in that place like I I heard like you have to walk for like 10 minutes and then you can have like signal some signal yeah and but did they have did they have uh some electricity there no no not at all and water is from the river and uh they have gas like a tank thanks and donkeys they will take or something or what they do with that they're I think with a boat like uh with an engine you know because it's like uh it's along there along the river you just have to go up the river which river it's called Don Diego okay well it's like a little yeah like a little village like a river that goes around the Sierra that does this so I don't know if it's around but like it just goes up to where there's the snow is yeah and that's the river and you know this like it's like this street goes from Santa Marta to Palomino yeah I don't know like that like sketchy Street like I to me like I don't really understand why it's like this Narrow Street like it's like so important it's just one lane yeah yeah it's like it's crazy so basically like you just drive that part uh like close to Palomino and then there's a river and from there you take a boat up the river for like I don't know 15 minutes 20 minutes and that's where we were okay so from Palomino you took the boat and then you end up up yeah oh wow yeah I get it wow and also the river is like super shallow because there's not much water I see I was thinking that so what kind of boat is that I don't know what kind it's a small one with the engine I think you saw me or you send me a picture yeah yeah it has a motor so um with a good guess I think but then sometimes like it's too shallow that we have to get off and walk on the shore until there's enough water again for the boat to continue so we had to like get off like twice like three times until we get there and um but you could also walk it's not so far I think 30 minutes maybe 45 minutes so what happened when we went back from the the house to the that street was like uh so we were staying with the kids like the oldest one is probably like around 20 years old and the others were like around 10. kids from the village from the the community because um in the house the father is uh the spiritual leader Mamo and he's like taking like a ritual at that moment so he was gone so only the kids were there and they're proposing us to go down the river they said they made they made a boat for us so they can take the equipment or their packages and we can swim to go down the river instead of walking to go so going down go back go back yeah going down the mountain and then what okay so we were like okay this sounds cool so we can you know swim in the river and then we end up in the in the village but what they made is like a small raft I don't know like it's a palm tree or whatever like they just could like four pieces they tied together and I had like you know phones and uh I had my computer as well everything is like your computer like the Vlog the sotak or your that one I left here but the one I'm using the the tablet and like hard drive and stuff and yeah okay like I don't know like I would have just walked but uh we put everything on that raft and put everything on the show you put everything on the raft yeah I mean all the all the packages because then we have to swim wow okay I will be I will be thinking I will be stressed out of this I know like I I was feeling like I was I was not alive and also the river was like like the the stream is like really fast and it's very shallow so like we were like keep hitting like like big stones when we were swimming because it was not because it's not really there's not enough yeah and they should be super cold at water no it's quite cold yeah yeah so I was freezing and then but in the end the raft like it was like stranded somewhere like it couldn't continue so we took the baggages and we walked to the shore we walked from there so like I was thinking we could have just started like from the beginning just walking and it was no stress but I guess that's the adventure it sounds like have an adventure yeah but those guys are crazy they're indigenous people like ottawako people actually so when I was at the hostel there were like two indigenous guys working there for the plantation and stuff and uh one of them actually is like friends with the family where I visited before the going to the hostel and they are like you know they how do you say it like they carry like huge Stones like for fun like they just like on the river they find like a big piece of stone and it's just like lifted and that's like their entertainment or Sports it's a game it's a game yeah wow yeah like yeah kind of yeah I mean I cannot even yeah I I I guess I can't imagine a bit but also conversation with uh having I talked with uh with Gabrielle the guy with Gabriel you remember Gabriel yeah yeah so and then we were into makumaima did you were you there when we were talking about makumahima is this book anyway is I think makumaima is the story of a hero like some hero like some indigenous hero but then it so it has a very I mean if if you if you start reading that you can shock yourself very fast because the way all the The Story Goes is very what you will you could consider violent they use they will language sometimes like even the the hero rapes uh the hero like it's uh is like the construction of how we use language as Western People is very different um so like these binarisms it doesn't exist or is difficult at the beginning you you shock yourself very fast okay with this like it's almost gross um but then you go into basically just the it's a very it's a playful it's a guy who is very playful and and with so and I think it has to be with we were talking a bit of that like that should be part of that's yeah that's cultural that should come from like roots in the Indigenous somehow so like say for instance we were saying is so say gorilla is like really like a good example Gabriel is a PhD in philosophy and appeared in physics right and he's a professor in this Urban and stuff like that so and lately he's been more interested in so he still he does his work um I think that he he has this interest I think he's supposed dogs is in what he does in buff basically that's he likes to do that like to try to transmit this knowledge to artists um but if you really go more into more under that layer then he's more confronting himself with this like think of like Europeans and being somebody who comes from Argentina and then and then we talk on that uh and yeah and yeah it's interesting but you see like from for me I've been like I'm excited so he's really when I talked to him like then he says that he's willing to that like into reading a lot and seeing different movies of like more that uh more that approach and since the last three months I think with the chat uh GPT right uh this thing I have been through a lot of just Western philosophy while I'm reading this book because then you can just go really fast and then just what does uh the loose say about performance in relation to uh buddy or like you can go really specific and then just you have like shortcuts constantly of uh so I have been like three months getting into things that are having speaking more empirically I think so I what I'm saying is that comparing to I think the Gabriel is really going more inwards like more into that kind of knowledge like more uh empirical and more not so non-western knowledge somehow and try to investigate more in that uh he's really fascinated the way we speak about it is like is is super into that and I'm this three months I have been really into just Western philosophy uh I mean with my Approach uh that is more into phenomenology I guess or these kind of things phenomenon and that is all related with best practices all this thing right [Music] yeah but it's a it's a mess it's amazing but at the same time then like I was thinking and so I think I'm trying to go I think I will expand the BR exploration that I did in in in in motion bank right um as a case of used to to just go more in academic path because it's or at least it's what it says to me um I see we have a workshopa by the way next week if if we publish this I don't know it is like with motion Bank next week in Berlin in some place called I.T you know this place called I.T International theater Institute no I never heard of that but they're doing this I'm just gonna just share it right here and the main keynote is hope I mean the the festival is keynote is by uh chok Cafe of course when I saw it like that's the main name and he will he will do the keynote nice so I was actually like thinking about him because he works a lot with uh like indigenous communities or like rituals and well that's more in Asia Southeast and also Siberia as well I think and now now I understand like why he's like so into it because like you know I was not there in Sierra Nevada for like a research in that perspective but like talking with people there like you know it's so rich and then you don't have to create anything it's just there and you can like I mean you can't you shouldn't reappropriate what they have but I think the way he's working like actually inviting people from there or like you know like actually doing research with people there asking this uh Shaman to where the motion capture suit and stuff I think it's really really interesting what he does well I I but I think also the is the in Asia I mean I haven't been in Asia but it's from what I saw what he shared their exists already like culture of uh their culture is really uh I mean they have culture of interact through technology with uh with some technology with uh I mean you see what I mean some people is I know some interfaces some attempts to have some technological uh element to connect with some yeah like I think some of the people he's working with yes like in I think in Taiwan or something but also like he goes to like Siberia like middle of nowhere and you know okay with people like I guess people without electricity kind of or like even like no internet kind of people yeah okay so yeah I guess we have to invite him to the chat at some point I don't know if I want no no I mean as a friend yes having this conversation is quite heavy that's why I was like oh yeah we should have done like like chat when we're in Hamburg like with different people but like not as a whole group but with like you know someone like three but yeah Hamburg was really fast yeah yeah and we're yeah anyways let's not think about it too much but it will come again I think those opportunities there was uh they were supposed also to do something in February but uh something that I applied but they replied to know you remember like it was the same framework of humble yeah yeah yeah right yeah it's okay did they reply to you no because I think you applied I didn't you know but yeah I apply alone yeah yeah because I wasn't sure and anyways I won't be there in February of course you were not sure right so I guess we should just finish with this Zoom uh 40 minutes and then we move on to practicals we have we have two minutes yeah yeah but it's practical what is coming up oh yeah this uh I'm working I'm working on experience with with uh I think I want to go one in one in this path like there is I think I'm trying to follow the academic path taking as a case of use the virtual reality yeah because it's just really concrete and I mean kind of you can just almost be in a vacuum space and it seems Seems at least for what I'm seeing a bit of that I would like to go and understand a bit what does that mean you know in the in that direction I'm bad so that's one thing and then there's best practices but this is best practices is for me it's like an umbrella thing yeah yeah everything because I was also thinking like I'll support other projects like to consider what for me best practices is like an umbrella thing because it's so complex because so it's a mess though it's everything so it's difficult to articulate and I mean to be more precise with some things which maybe in the practice itself doesn't need to you know but for practical Frameworks is is uh is not practical it's right yeah I get what you mean it's very abstract you know it's very abstract which is awesome because we are getting better in handling the abstraction yeah you know it's like I think what at some point we talk about this like I think what is really interesting from the best practices and those is is we found out methodologies that work yeah so it's more a way of working so it's an ontology it's something that is always in becoming in the process and becoming something bad and sometimes become these and sometimes something else yeah and also like we have like different branches like that ended up in like a workshop or like the the web installation thingy that I could use in the uh in tirona I saw the colors were so glitchy we have less than a minute it's gonna look I I have more yeah I have I have like 20 subscribers not I don't know from where they come well your family yeah okay this is gonna finish so thanks for watching and you know please subscribe if you haven't please like the video what it is following social medias yes well I don't have so yeah social media are you actually active on social media I'm posting when I can like the Instagram like and yeah please try to put one time per week one video around time on space nice yeah yeah like mostly working with those designer yeah", "wuoRRQ0jFoI": "hello hello so deeply organize it chat if you have a nice chat so the lecture is done yes the workshop we're taking the lecture is more or less finished we just have like feedback round and yeah in the afternoon that's it so good i'm leaving tomorrow yeah you're doing tomorrow yeah yes i'm staying for the senses alone the next meeting is about healing practices with focusing on astrology yesterday so we did the second workshop yeah the best practices workshop yesterday great yeah i actually started frame it and the way i put it is uh also youtube as it's always a worksheet performance actually because people are like participating with the performance yeah and if i think if it works the better the work or let's say the more flow the workshop has the less focus we need to have less reference people need to have from us like yesterday as you said we have to be more conscious of like sometimes guiding indirectly while in hamburg people perhaps because of the space and i don't know why people were more like uh autonomous understanding faster the proposition yeah yeah i mean the difference is i mean there's a lot of differences but there the context was more or less clear i mean it's not clear but they expect something with digital yeah dance that's true and here it was like with the participants of other workshop of this chaos theory so i mean it's not that they're not connected but it's you know they don't know what to expect right and we didn't say much about it so yeah and uh one partly i mean quite often there is so many different uh interesting feedback that we got um but one thing that uh was certainly like it was a recurring thing um and that's my appreciation from the point of view of puff and the people who yeah people come here somehow often are related with performing arts is people will speak about care basically so it's people who have practices they have uh experience with framework frameworks care frameworks so [Music] when something like what we propose is not uh people were speaking in different ways that's my interpretation about care like about some please somebody care about me i don't understand what is what is supposed to happen yeah i mean there's different levels of care any level or in terms of like layers because just to you know like just make it simple and just maybe reiterate but the way you can care in terms of like running workshop could be giving clear instructions which we didn't do but it doesn't mean that we didn't care because we did in a different layer in a way like we start with code of content for example but yeah that is you know obviously one of the way to do it and but then we didn't give clear instructions we just said you know one hour just respect each other and just use objects or yeah because people bring something and we also cross some stuff also computers are there so just do something with it yeah but to me i mean obviously that's also a way of caring but it depends on how like depends on the person who receives it right or it depends on the needs of the person exactly yeah yeah because exactly because i think it's it's important when you said because if what we're trying to propose is that's my take not this my word but what we're trying to propose is like to uh agent people in space to exercise the space uh in a non-binary way or like yeah that's the when i will go start going in that direction of the colonizing knowledge then the person will start also is a subjective is a matter of subject subjectivity uh how much the people how much the person needs from need to know basically how much how much the people can regulate it's about how people can regulate himself basically i don't know if i get it sorry i was a bit distracted but from the discussion yesterday i was i'm quite interested like how what we can add or like well how we can experiment with the format like in terms of like what we say at the beginning when we start workshop because it's quite minimal at the moment but it's that crucial that's like that's the entry point yeah and you know we just did twice and well this time like we added um please don't damage anything but also you said like you know we shed vulnerability which i think we said in the first one maybe i said or you said like well hamburg i think it was important that i i think it was in my head it was really important but this time it was something somehow like slipped off and then you said it so it was really good um because the three that was saying that the resume yeah like yeah i was thinking also that something that we miss and that that's hard like i think if i think in conflict or like what didn't work somehow and then relate to what didn't work uh among others in the that on the dancing process while you were away so just the chat was this an acknowledgement of the body this we forgot to do yesterday so this this is i think this is fundamental and we forgot completely how to make people aware because everybody just come and we are in this uh very open way of thinking yeah so i think that's fundamental that if the people come so the people just come like home like here and even though i'm very open if i don't have some entry point where somebody's kind of acknowledged like introduce my body within the other bodies and the space which is basically that was the preposition of hamburg all come together and then basically they convened to fill your body within the space and within the other bodies then if that's not there then you're you're skipping one part and actually what you're requesting for the people is to be sensible but you're not giving sensibility to them you just give them the black hole i mean a black space like a very broad space um so if one of the conflicts of the is that we don't know exactly how much knowledge how much how much instructions how much language do you need to in order to start like because that could become a political problem like what do we want you know so if so that's a different topic but before going in there it's just basics like if what we want is people to people to exercise that we're proposing uh basically to be sensible and caring with the space and others in a non-atropod-centric way then we need to give them some body entrance also yeah and that was uh that was missing yeah so something that we all like to add is that and that so this is uh that i think so i understand that we have this really relaxed way how we do the things but i think what we are involving other people we should pressures ourselves a bit more in terms of like you know like uh we have to care a bit more of like i don't know like not leave things for last minutes like yesterday we were i mean you'll be running too much that's my my my thing maybe i can say that personally towards you i thought like where are you you know like i think it is with other people then i think we have to care a bit of what is going to happen um it's just basic things you know the internet isn't working is it working because i know we make it work and that's fine but nevertheless because there's people coming which i think we could uh still take into account an hour i think i think half an hour is too short yeah but also yesterday like the well in the end i think people participated came like roughly on time those who wanted to participate so no we're just reporting but it's fine um yeah but that's something like i think we need to make sure like maybe we have to be really explicit about you know like if you want to join come on time for example like this is like kind of before a quarter of contact or part of quarter conduct actually that we have to share before we start like you know bring an object that's one thing but also like you know be punctuated and yeah maybe we could because for instance people can come and they can watch and just go for instance but then if you want to participate of the workshop then be on time yeah they can leave and come back but they have to get like i think it's good to like also the afraid of you know having one hour of this that we have start and end and i think that will really give us uh yeah like room for you know being relaxed and prepared when we start and of course you know we can take into account you know 10 minutes or 15 minutes before we start that's okay but you know i to me it was not probably it was not good that they said you know people can in and out because from the beginning yeah from the beginning they have to be there at the beginning well end yes and no i mean they don't have to be but at the beginning at least uh yeah they have to be there and then yeah we make sure that you know if someone's missing you know they can't join no especially because we need i mean all this aspect that we're trying to propose from the beginning uh so what we are proposing is not that it isn't an anarchy an artistic space right we don't want to go into into anarchy and people just extremely go into anarchy and just breaking things or like just go really to explosion where you cross lines with others in space so i think the beginning of that space there is very blurry and it's not really clear for them is it must we can be better in this uh ritualistic approach it must be a ritual like for instance on something that is a gesture that is a reparative ritual as implicit is one hour that gives them uh [Applause] some time frame where they know this is not gonna last forever so they just go for it and so i think we could think more consciously of what are those elements that we need uh uh maybe not fix them by just kind of like bullet points like okay these are for instance before we start writing the code of conduct i think we should but that will come more with practice but i guess we should this should be more clear for us like what are the things that we really need to share with them yeah yeah yeah and i think we just have to practice it practice the workshop yeah yeah that's that's key this is key yeah yeah and also like last night we were talking about you know for example there's a metal ball with heavy one and you have a laptop on the floor and yeah like things you know things can break if we don't even though even though we said the like to one of the parts of the code of conduct yeah i said just you know don't damage anything but more precisely like everything things have to be back to the original state but you know what i was thinking actually that that i if i would do the same thing today i will literally just take the board that is at the hanger with the four puff rules put it there and then just refer to them because if they have a uh they have been in pub for some days so although they don't understand that the space if they go that with that space with some uh yeah but thinking in those rules i think maybe they won't cross some lines that already were crossed yeah but that works here but i think they could work in this space i was thinking that yesterday that i think it's very similar the i think i think that workshop is very similar how i experienced at least no no i'm saying that is correct but it only works here because i don't know yeah but at the same time i think like maybe i would like to experiment like somehow like to to take from these rules also and maybe to change the wording or something but i think um because there are there are not so many and and if somehow people can understand a little bit it's all about that you know like make it possible for others minor symmetries yeah i mean it's like what i'm just thinking is probably it's interesting to research a little bit of like what kind of conduct people have like ah for example they have i don't know how they call it it's called conductor no rules yeah and you know well i was i was doing a bit of research at one point you know what kind of code of conduct is like you know you can find online and different uh i mean for events like they use quite similar ones but they just adapt for their knees for the event or for the meet up or whatever and in that sense it's not directly like applicable to what we do because it's more about kind of you know like if someone's doing wrong you can report to someone from the team like this is a bit like you know but it's not exactly what we need but i think more general sense i think we can learn from you know what people are phrasing like those words because path i think they do it well but it's also very specific and it works for certain like community let's say i mean not that saying that it's not good or like it's good or bad but it's kind of adapted to the space i feel yeah it's for his face yeah it's not for the people but for the space yeah yeah yeah and people have to learn if they don't know about you know what is that symmetry for example you know it's not obvious like we use it often but it's not obvious at all and you can integrate in different ways yeah i think and maybe maybe in that direction could be also that something that is proving published like that those things the accidents happen all the time constantly every day there are misunderstandings because there is not so much clarity and there is no narrative and abstraction and on the rules and stuff so that's part of how that framework is i mean what that how puff is but i think yes that will be yeah yeah yeah i think it's a bit it's it's tyler made two paths building yeah this is space but i it's also you know we can adapt to for ourselves i mean for what we need and we can i mean we already create our you know language and we just have to find uh you know fine-tuning that we use our language in a way yeah but also it's you can deliver it it's understandable for others yeah actually i was thinking because i think in the first workshop i was a bit afraid of like using concepts that we have developed but i think yesterday they came out more naturally and so i think we should not be afraid to just basically frank and the main things that will be named first and like we have to speak about grouping and grouping uh all these concepts that we have developed we just name it and maybe we could something comes next right away because otherwise it's just i mean that's why we are doing the chat basically yeah i mean in terms of chat i think it's important maybe we separate from like our chat because or like you know at least i think it's interesting to like start with asking like so what happened to this moment this dance workshop moment like what happened and i asked because i feel like well yeah i have to say you speak a lot but also i speak a lot about you know our experience so it's not that who's doing more or less but uh because if we start saying okay by the way this was our intention was this and that then it's kind of it's becomes question that answers no no but i don't speak about i'm not speaking about um talking about it but just in let's say if naturally you end up in spot when you need to say something because that's what i was about what i was doing in hamburg it's like when i'm trying to just talk then these concepts come in my head and i'm trying to not use the concepts uh because i thought people don't understand and then i start doing more rounds and not go to the point that i'm trying to make then yesterday i at some point i felt the same but then i thought no okay i just use the the concept and then give some short thing next to it and i think that make sure the the message that's how i felt it so you you did it more concisely yeah because because i'm not avoiding the concert in hamburg i was avoiding to say like grouping and grouping i mean to mention these things that we have these concepts that we develop yeah but i feel like the way i thought i mean is that maybe we just don't say anything and just start with what people say and if there's like ideas like you know who's grouping and grouping or self-associate self-dissociation that's something or like you know touching those topics then we can start talking about it but then if we have around and start talking about okay this is this experience for me is like this i mean it's it's one way of doing it it's not i'm not saying it's good or bad but maybe it's better but it can be more interesting to give agency to the other participants first to talk about it and then we can develop on it because we have knowledge knowledge exactly yes it's symmetrical in terms of knowledge yeah if that space is the challenge like a epistemological place uh in terms of knowledge then it's true it's not symmetrical because if then if you start speaking then you speak um from the beginning already the people will understand like these guys you know i don't know yeah but also like yeah i mean in other ways looking at it is like to me the workshop is like something every time it's fresh because it's a different constellation and to me i want to like in a way like unlearn of like and learn what we are doing and just think about like the first time i don't know like july 8th or something uh 2020 that we did practice and then since then of course it took a long time to develop these ideas yeah and with other people like if you assume that we have you know 50 times 100 times doing something with them then something different will appear so i want to kind of you know yeah like yield i don't know this yeah from this new constellation so it's like something new yeah yeah yeah i get it yeah but of course it's not you for us and it's you know that's kind of but no but but as part of this i thought actually it was so funny that at some point um uh gabriel mentioned it and also i think the way you put how you uploaded in youtube was you said it says i think it's like i know from the hamburg you said like uh so best practices and they were participants i didn't labor wow but you see like for me it actually makes sense because i i'm making the analogy with with uh with what gabriel was saying and in terms of like at one po finish and then when he finished he was saying he was joking with me and he was saying he said he was saying something like no no finish no like you pay me you're saying something like that in spanish like pay me for my work and and and that's the way i interpret that but and i like it better i like it better because it's true that since is a workshop performance then you have to give credits to them yeah that's actually i was feeling wrong about how i was doing because yeah everyone's has to be creative yeah of course so but but then that's the way how i would i think it's funny because they're working because they're working and i think it's like should be like that i'm opening in that conversation and i'm building on that also that how like that's yeah how is strategies how i think one way for you bypass politics and this we have been speaking about this before one way how you bypass politics is like asking somebody else to basically define your work and then you don't have to do create a granting just you do something from uh yeah like rather than writing the localized something that you have produced before finishing aesthetically or conceptually just you put it out and then you use people actually experience to bypass politics then after just you finish with the aesthetics and you finish your project and i think it's totally that's something that if he's open i mean if people understand that that's what is going to happen i think it's totally fine like i would be fine as a publisher as an audience to be part taking part in some workshop or the of that if the if there is a workshop proposed what i where i understand that this that i'm taking is a workshop performance then i then it's up to me that uh then to take it or not basically and in technology like i don't want to be alone in this because it seems to me that you don't understand what i'm saying but what i'm saying is that because i see it in technology often then because you use a lot of like technical things and there are so many different things so i think one of the ways why i've seen people work that i think it's effective and i don't see nothing wrong with that and the thing that capitalism approach is you create something that is interesting you're not sure which position to take on that because it might be so you have something that is complete as a technical framework and then you put it out for people to do something with it and then after that then just you maybe use the data basically to uh to finish the project and then you don't have to think on the politics on that i mean the politics that's in the realm that we speak of politics which is politics slash intention what is your intention as an artist okay but i don't know if i lost you yeah i mean the last technological part um yeah i don't i didn't really i couldn't really follow um and i mean just saying like something is really a big picture i don't really i kind of understand but also don't is the thing that we're using this labor is which is highly political yeah but i know what you're trying to say i mean i don't fully get it but um you kind of make it into a framework basically so that you can you don't think about it but it's involved in politics yeah i mean and of course like you i mean you can simplify things with not mentioning that or like just mentioned differently they think uh participants of the workshop or something like that you know like you could be more straightforward like when you say labor participant or labor uh performers then it's basically a political approach to something uh so which make things more complicated um but i thought it was i mean the way i read it i thought it was like that [Music] yeah but i think this is something i mean maybe we have to talk about it like again and again and also in the chat probably we will come back and chat with the participants if we do the workshop and then we'll see i guess yes it's something and also it's not something we will find something fixed but it's always changing can be their neighbors or we can list every one of them you know but also then it makes me think is like what's interesting is like then why don't we credit other people like olivia is making hydra and it's live i mean the problem with doing this properly let's say because if this is about more like being correct again the problem of doing this properly is that it will if we start doing this right now then we will uh slow down pro slow down processes because then you need to okay i cannot upload it now because not yet i don't have all of i don't have all the emails oh so you know how it goes yeah so um and i think there's nothing so even though we're trying to be correct i think we should not change and adjust like change the the dynamics i will speak more and then dynamics of how it goes like i think no many artists like for dream for instance for example is her friend floor that for instance she wants to do these things but she cannot put it like really fast like online so for instance like a performance in in in in in hangar was really good like things that took from from the distance but i checked and she yet is not posting something so i think this dynamics that we have in the practice and how fast focus online is something that i wouldn't like to to slow down because of uh being correct or yeah i mean so i think you i mean i don't touch it but uh but i i don't agree that we just have to do it and then if we find a way we need to find a way how to address these people anyway yeah but if there's a problem then we have to negotiate but you know yeah we just have to do it i mean i don't have uh one million subscribers exactly yet yeah okay maybe we should close here because the lunch is ready yeah so please subscribe and you thanks and i guess i will see you now and comment uh if you want to have us our workshop please comment where you are and we'll see then we travel trouble so i guess next time i will see you i will be in colombia i guess wow because i don't know in person next time i will see you will be in colombia man yeah crazy nice yes thanks for watching", "4Gc4CfeP6lg": "hello so hello what's up thank you today no i was yeah yeah i i know i don't know in the morning yeah and we did the workshop yeah in japan yeah i was there working out there and then i went to the room and then i sleep like one hour i think okay yeah yeah anyways the lunch was late so yeah they're very slow it's a day off it's a day off but it's not too bad you know it's still busy yeah i by the way everything is moved one hour no did it hurt okay it makes sense yeah that's that's good i mean because we started eating around three so yeah there was no chance it starts at three yeah so then we yeah then we can start at eight instead of okay that's better for us i mean for me because i have one meeting at five why are we filming this we are filming this because to say to friday her cheetahs are nice but dangerous i want to make a public statement they're so good that's so good you cannot like just eat two can you just eat two they're like 50 of these little pieces they're warm they're very nice keeps coming from the oven they keep coming so it feels more like a duty that you have to do it right totally that's the way i feel like everyone has to eat it somebody has to eat it once you realize then there's like five of those and you still you're thinking to have a next one yeah so then you've already ate four dumplings oh yes by the way those were nice like they're kind of like argentina nice so we did that chaotic bread yes no i did not ah maybe i was already awake and i was gone maybe because i had to do the paperwork why are you filming this uh i have to do paperwork for the visa application and stuff so i i wanted to like call oh yeah i wanted to call the japanese uh colombian embassy in japan first because because of time zone it's already open when you even if you wake up at six yeah like you know yeah because that's always a problem with australia like australia i mean like yeah like with the japan you know like yeah yeah it's like yeah i mean if you organize a property it actually works well because at one point i was organizing a lot of like calls with people in japan for this event processing thingy and because they mostly have time after work so like yeah five or six no i was i was just thinking that actually that actually for me what is difficult is to arrange with people in colombia because normally the only time i work on boat is when here is seven eight nine like when he's like yeah after five for sure i mean depends if they wake up if they're ready at ten yeah already so today first in my meeting at seven is ten already early in mexico which is okay yeah but then the thing is the problem is when you have let's say saturday a meeting like next saturday i have about this meeting at seven like then your weekend is yeah like we think weekdays is okay but then on saturday at 7 00 pm or it's just not good because then you cannot leave like for instance we were planning with eva to come and then i said to her like no saturday you cannot come so you have to come on sunday okay because then my saturday is the hub it's break it's broke yeah yeah yeah this is always a problem i mean like if it's like seven hours difference it's okay you know like one part in like late afternoon one part in like morning it's possible but like from here like nine hours difference is like uh west coast in the states for example yeah that's tough yeah yeah but yeah six hours is okay seven hours six hours i think i mean it depends you know if if you both have want to call in the afternoon it doesn't work but yeah yeah do we do practice yeah we didn't practice once i was in japan yeah short one yeah and we were talking like yeah in japan we didn't have so much trouble well because i was free all day i didn't have anything to do so i don't know like maybe i wasn't was in the evening in japan but you know it doesn't matter for me and here it's like early afternoon i don't know okay so what is happening today oh yeah of course we're doing the practice workshop we're doing a workshop yes doing a workshop in part so i think we should do the same that we did yeah so let's start account yeah and just like we introduce also some code of conduct like would be actually useful if we have some paper i think we can find it yeah because that's what i was thinking because people tend to come like late yes and for sure because if there's nothing written there's nothing we can do to them do we come from paper yeah i think we should search for paper and put it yeah i mean at least we have like small pieces of paper in the hangar i think yeah yeah that i think i think in the media space there should be these rows of paper ah okay i think so yeah just right but what was called code product but we have i have pictures of that oh yeah i took a picture of it i thought i did but i couldn't find it actually like something that i think like i mean but let's go that i need to ask you is that i guess i will probably will have a feel a lot of pressure uh because i'm here so i guess i will need some support from you from your side yeah i mean i will let you know like how i feel like yeah you will feel me basically yeah i mean the way i'm just think saying it loud but the way i would probably do it is i try to be natural i mean like yeah because i will feel it but i will try to be like you know normal and that's how yeah because because normally for reason like i'm the one that person in in impulse dance and i'm telling you i take more that roll up like i will guide and i will let you go more free so i think i will need more support from this this time um yeah but also like in hamburg we were doing it okay yeah but humber was completely okay yeah i mean in the sense that it's not like how you feel how i feel but how like it's not actually we both yeah like try to you know keep some space and yeah it's happening i hate traction i'm not going but i think it will start in five minutes it's starting with the fractal lecture i was curious actually i was thinking maybe i will like work on the side and just listen but nice yeah you let me know but yeah no the thing in hamburg was like i think yeah we were like you know not going full-on and also like it's more about like caring others i think there was really a lot happening from both of us yeah yeah yeah i think so and i guess it's just like i mean the same principle in a way today but i think it's just different what i think will be different is the the space because the space is uh alien to everyone at this point yeah that space that we were like we all were in contact with that space so people were more familiarized so and this space is huge the new space is huge yeah but i'm saying that it's safe in the sense that we have to you know feel it and have to care basically and then it should work yeah i mean of course again different degrees of you know yeah it's different actually so i think i would like to use up one projector some things that we would like to i think i would like to take all the nail polish there and then polish the entrance now can you take it there sure yeah i'll probably just don't care but if you need that was the planning and i just have to convert this video before we start i mean yes yes but yeah yes so i have more space on this camera i know that if i'm using my computer i don't want to do that anyways we don't do the chat right uh i think by the end i would like to do something a little bit yeah like uh because i think it will be good maybe but maybe we don't time it yeah but we just feel like uh we propose to uh share a bit of what it is so maybe at the entrance at the beginning we said like that we will practice basically try to not ask so and at the end we will do a session where we were more like talk like a little bit of what is it yeah like basically exactly what we did in hamburg yeah yeah i'm just not sure if i have enough storage let's see because otherwise you have to convert the thing let's see i'll figure it out but that doesn't take that much big time because this video is not too long yeah but my computer is super slow um yeah it's a little bit like i other thing what i was thinking is maybe i'm this is more a proposition like would you maybe think that perhaps yeah so maybe i think i would like to put a i like to have one computer maybe with something wait let me try to organize my my thoughts i thought that maybe perhaps this could be interesting if we have like a shared google document uh where people can access i mean they can write things and we can reuse it if you want to but also where we could put perhaps a link to hydra or a sketch i don't know maybe that's more complicated yeah maybe it was just open windows like different windows links maybe you don't have to click there but a document will be nice like even it could be white how did gianna like start working on that on hydra there and the ho ho that happened i think she started changing the values but how it happened like how did she manage to go to hydra no because i have hyper open uh so she used your computer yeah okay but then like she started looking at it and then so i i told her like how to open it on her computer yeah okay that was a question yeah that was a question i thought yeah no but even if i didn't tell her like she was looking at the url and you know like try to open it and learn it on her own actually that was really nice yeah so we need a projector and a hashing cable paper paper pen and nail polish maybe a table will be good like one table two tables maybe it could be good like to put a yeah actually it could be if that we put some things for people to sit down or to lay uh like some kind of mattress something yeah something like some questions or something like this of the space when once they enter it's not like if you pass the big space now it's really cold so that the space feels a bit more inviting like to come inside and yeah lay down see it yeah yeah that will be nice it can be also a good rehearsal for the university [Music] yeah what i was thinking is that this will be the thing is this workshop in a way it keeps the whole thing of what practices somehow um but at the at the university so this was not planned but i think it would be nice because it's kind of i see it as a offering uh sharing with them and by the university it will be more fragmented because the information they will get is it's just this playlist and a chat that the last time when we tried this hybrid format was quite difficult here no when we did it to the doc on the dance ah because you won't be here you will be in colombia the same yeah but i think the difference is like the back then like i invite an elena and class to be with me yeah so that i think that generated that was another symmetry it makes things more complicated yeah because already you are not in the space and yeah yeah so i hope that will be more natural so hot so maybe close and uh i'll try to yeah catch yeah maybe not i go homework in the small library yeah so thank you for watching sorry for the video sorry for this conversation this that we speak like why do you say it sorry i'm so sorry [Music] please subscribe if you're watching until this point that probably you subscribed and you probably hit the like button already like please and see you the next one", "zeYkwulatSo": "now it's a very relaxed today yeah i've been sleeping i'm sorry i'm just it's feeling that's actually better after lunch which is kind of weird because after lunch you would be like eating heavy true yeah but maybe it helped that i actually moved doing dishes did did you help them performing cleaning performance no i announced to some people that i can't do this because i was like literally that time i was like really you saw like me at the workshop the sound stuff yeah in the end i i just i was just laying down because oh you laid down i really i really couldn't and i think i told you you know like i can't do this or something like that yeah but like i i was just fading out and then i just went to sleep i really couldn't yeah i mean nobody's gonna tell you you have to do it as long as you you i mean you do something else yeah i mean i've been doing dishes like hell yeah it's like hell [Laughter] like i'm in the hell you know i died like the prime minister and uh you know i have this all this yeah or whatever people tell you like no way but this guy was doing dishes as hell no no like no now i'm in hell that i have to do the dishes all the time because i'm in hell oh why you're in hell well because because of my behavior in the past life i don't know oh wow that's becoming very abstract it is what are we talking about see it's not working so so nice like i really want to invite like uh john mitchell to the next chat would be nice he's a really interesting person yeah we can talk she was speaking about something called like non philosophy i've never heard about that have you heard of that no interesting i think the idea in a big scale and just misused words is in a big scale is that there is no reality as such so so no matter what you do there is nobody there's they just no wait that that you don't that you don't know reality and you never will get reality but yet it is meaning that there is it's just uh alien to you so it is but you can never will you can never experience that okay you will find anything that you want around that idea but reality as a concept of is not is not such so this is used as an interface somehow to then meaning that he did an analogy that is very similar how we do the practice with the non-binary in terms of uh technologies and so queer conversation between technology and bodies he says that so the way how they approach philosophy is then you take one school at the time and then you analyze it we think this art with this rule understanding that there is no reality and basically what that allows you is to keep distance from it because you are not in reality so you bypass the politics if you want to setting what we speak about uh you don't compromise yourself with being inside of reality you take some distance and you can analyze and learn but you don't get emotional and all these things because you know you are not there and i think that's at the core but the whole thing is about why part like what it is i don't know but why you need it i kind of understand the whole conversation started because he said we were speaking about i don't know exactly i said that oh it's a slow card oh because the data is big let's try like some sd cards it has problem with 4k because 4k is super big like the bandwidth twice also it has to write a lot yeah yeah but i also will consume more power no that too yeah of course everything bigger bigger it's entropy but because we were talking about him and he said about 4k well he just ran 4k on the camera so let's stick to 4k so he said like he's working in uh i think what he does i ask him yeah i asked him are you a singer because he was singing at the chapel like like oh that was him yeah like really beautiful as a proper opera singer and then he said like uh i i that he went to school but nowadays like for maybe 30 years he's working with and he's interested in uh financial something calculus with financial things okay and he's working with computers for 30 years and then then i was trying to suggest that okay that has to be with a lot of systems and how you know when you try to see what happens no simulation but what they use a lot in the in the stock market you know you try to foresee the future that's the name of that in mathematics uh it's not calculus it's a um yeah i cannot remember exactly what it is is when you try to foresee things in the future yeah i forgot anyway is that when you're trying to foresee what is going to happen in the future depending of yeah basing some data before seeing um statistics and so and then i was trying to suggest like then from the point of view of development then like in development then you will work more with logic and then he said like no absolutely no and he was like really categorical and no and i was like wow okay but know how and he was trying to say something that at the end i i got it his point was his approach is very poetic to code and but then my lack of knowledge i guess in coding is coming through development so and from things that somehow they're alien to me um then i just was saying that he was saying that coding is actually for being a good coder you need to be a good literature you need to know about literature you need to know how to write and that's it if you know how to write a book like you can be a good coder you know how to write a paper you can be a good coder and it has to be nothing with logic i see yeah i mean it's interesting topic because i'm gonna just over generalize this but it's like a often like misconception that people have to like if you want to be a good coder like you have to you know know these all these you know logic or algorithm yeah whatever like for example like this uh like really easy uh example is like computer science if you study computer science can you be a good coder that's absolutely not because that's not they don't teach you how to code basically or like how to write good code the best practices in coding is like is missing and but not saying that computer science is bad you know it's a different thing that it's very specific thing um well maybe again like easy if i take easy example like these days machine learning that's in computer science mostly and you needed to develop new models but that's not like you know if you have a well if you have a startup maybe you want to make a new model but if you just may want to make instant you know profit from like actual projects looking at real world things you don't start with building models you just take someone's model and apply it and that part is like actually actual you know what i don't know 90 or 95 or maybe 99 but coding is is just like building these things that actually runs and not about proposing something new and that's probably something like you know what you're saying about development like development writing a book because you have to have some kind of structure you have to know your big picture maybe i i see it like that from the example of book because if you write a book you can't just write sentence by sentence right i mean that's how it works but but you need an overview right you need to have a research before writing a book and also just looking at the structure wise it has to have the structure and someone has to know it know the whole thing right right and even if it's like different chapters and compiled there's someone compiling editing who has the overview and that's the same with the programming because you have different components and like yeah it has to work in harmony some sense and that's completely like different that that is a practice and that's not something that they teach in computer science or they study in research in computer science which has to be more with the subject of like uh what i will mention as a topological problem or like the the fact that basically you have to think really well conceptualize a lot uh what is it you want to do so it has to be more with a qualitative approach in the way how you want to start working on something i think it's quite convoluted problem because i wouldn't say no completely because it is of obviously like this structure is this qualitative for sure because it's not like you know you need how many pages of introduction and you know like it's something that you can put numbers on it like it really depends but also you know some kind of i don't know depending on the type of the book probably you have or like if you look at research article that it's really obvious that you started the background and then literature review and methodology and this is kind of already set so that's true but then there's another layer of like actually implementing that yeah i think that's more like hands-on and that's why i'm saying practice because it's something to be learned from practice yeah that's why we were talking with thomas a bit of by the way i don't know if you know like thomas has a very nice i haven't seen that's a pity but i i have heard that is a very nice performance about go uh thomas is a director and he writes out his pieces he's the one of the teachers of theater of parts of theater yeah but and so i think his plot is uh it goes around on the moment that the machine won in this in and go i think goes around that and i have heard like many comments of like really good reviews about it interesting and thereby i was mentioning thomas because in relation to the chaos theory worship he was mentioning that he's developing now a piece on chaos theory which he's taking some per his personal loss of of his father that's the plot but then we think that then he's just using the analogies of nature and loss to uh yeah to portray them chaos theory um and then in relation to the chaos chaos theory workshop he was saying that that he's missing uh and that perhaps i would agree with this that that we are missing more examples of nature where you can that you can find a lot where chaos is all the time see because then the workshop stays a lot in in theory and sometimes in the mathematics or in the in the yeah in the theoretical part and that's why we have sometimes these loops of questions of people asking why this letter you forgot to put i mean this is is people who don't really know or don't have the fundamentals of this like we don't have the fundamentals of mathematics to go so deep into a pro uh such a complex subject and then we're trying to grasp everything and that's very complicated yeah basically you have to go to university that's what i'm saying yes exactly that's what it does exactly and that's why i did [Music] no but i get i understand both like i i get what why thomas is saying and also why manuel is teaching that way because like what you said yeah i think it makes sense and it's always good to have like real world examples to understand things [Music] but also that's gets very tricky because if it's the [Music] the tricky thing of real world examples is that it's limited to well quite limited to this newtonian physics because that's what happens and yeah then if you want to say okay quantum mechanics and blah blah which is not the topic of this but like then you know if you want analogy there's no there's no analogy and that's the really like problematic thing like for example also this schrodinger's cat you people misunderstand this like people just make wrong ideas around it because it's actually not something i mean it's not something explained like that um yeah i see what i mean here yeah and then i think manuel's standpoint is that he really wants to go through the theory and not to give wrong ideas okay this is chaos this is not chaos you know i get the point yeah yeah yeah yeah but i also understand that you know without examples it's it's really hard to follow and it's really yeah like just looking at math and if you don't have any ideas then it's not really you know enticing to learn that's what's a good point it's a good one yeah yeah no yeah because if you want to go in quantum physics then you can record a glass of water but you can record the correct you know you have these experiments when they say like they have been recording like when you put a glass of water and then usually put a note in a glass of water that it says like i don't know happiness or sadness or something and then they have some results like this so maybe the example that you have is you have a recording of half an hour of the glass of water and they say voila there's the example in nature of quantum theory yeah yeah but yeah but the weird thing with quantum mechanics is that it's we can't see it but it's always happening i mean of course that's you know i mean that's what it is like our world is constructed like that and also if you look at like smartphones or whatever computer it's using like very specific condition in quantum mechanics that like kind of breaks the you know like how silicon like devices work is like really putting to extreme condition by applying voltage and like doing this tunnel effect which is like rarely happens like the probability is really low but you artificially make this through the silicone chips and that's how it's calculating how it's doing computation and so it's everywhere this weird quantum mechanics theory theory like that i don't know like i can't really you know remember but that's that's happening everywhere although we just don't notice and it's so frustrating that it you can't really explain it's not like you know there's this heat source and that's uh agitating the molecules and becomes that happens in thermodynamics yeah yeah it's not like that it's like this hole and there's electron and they recombine and emits energy like but that's what it is and it happened it happened it's happening yes so actually i wrote to john but art and science is hard i sent a photo of the blackboard this is what we're doing in france yeah because yeah it's it's hard it's it's hard yeah yeah anyways so i don't know summarize the workshop so we summarize the workshop the we have been two days no two days of workshop so far the whole yeah the today's the main lecture yeah lectures so i think there is two more to go yeah and so i think now we can summarize i can summarize the character what is chaos chaos theory is actually um very chaotic you need [Music] a slope not always but you need slope and some models which can be an analogy with an ass and as like an ass like the ass if you have underwear you have a slope you can you can predict the tangent the tangent of the underworld because it's not a line but it's a curve like right but then you can then predict the slope of the of the of the [Music] what space state space state space yeah yeah so you need that so what i'm saying is you need one of the ways where you can approach uh chaos theory is like with a an ass and some underwear that it covers half of the ass you cannot do it with a boxers you need to just cover like briefs that it allows this curve to happen stretch you yeah yeah so that's my take on chaos theory what can you say about hairs here and also i don't know i i can't say anything interesting more interesting than that but yeah but actually i i had a vague understanding of it before coming here and i think it was correct because i always look at this lawrence attractor which is it's like mathematical i don't know equations and there's always like if you do processing if you learn processing there's good example by dan schiffman and yeah he made a simple sketch of the lawrence tractor i've used it before i mean edited it before to just you know make some nice drawing diagram that equation that's basically it it's just like you know it's a set of equations in the program it's not changing because it's in the program but you can't predict what's what it's going to do it's it's but it's no sense that it's like drawing something it's not like just going exploding elsewhere but it's drawing it's you can draw it but in a fashion that it's not like always doing the same thing it's like kind of unpredictable but but it's but it goes in the same path i mean it not necessarily yeah but what i meant is like wait so it's not the same path but it used the vectors in a similar way yeah it's kind of constrained yeah it kind of moves in around like it looks random but it's always coming back yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah it will it will it will uh yeah because it's not about randomized it isn't uh it will move well within constraints yeah true and it's also like very simple equations i mean it doesn't have to be simple but the equations are said it's not like the parameters that i found interesting i mean that that i think that allow me to to access the information a bit more because that i mean just you have to just know that yeah so it's really it works well with programming and also like you know manual is doing this visualization and stuff it goes well because you can write down and program and just run it and it does something unpredictable and wait a question like do you like something that i i stopped my brain trying to understand because it's very complicated like i didn't understand the difference between like uh variables and parameters from programming i mean what is the difference what is the difference in the topic that we are speaking because that's something i don't i didn't understand because my head is still in programming with that mutable and immutable let's see what's the word yeah like in javascript in java you have that javascript you have left and const yeah and let's say parameters are const and variables are left oh wow in in the topic that we're speaking yeah yeah oh wow but yeah okay that's a bit confusing because i still in my head i'm trying to separating and also you know i put in arguments the variables parameters arguments i mean that's really oversimplifying but but it is so constants are parameters yeah and then variables are leds yeah okay no that's a good analogy so constant like so the parameters are immutable like a fixed point yeah so that's a fixed point it's a fixed value that's the thing about the explains it means something else yeah well it's a fixed value yeah like a fixed value yeah yeah but of course then if you look at the other diagram that has the state space with different parameters so parameters in that case you change the parameter but it doesn't change it's not it's not changing the the path depending on the model will change the path the the path it will yeah but even in that case the idea is that the const the parameter yeah is in that one session you change the variable the variable always change the variable with static number of the parameter and you do something and you get the result you get the topological structure or fixed point or whatever within the same parameter fixed const parameter yeah and then you move on to another parameter to evaluate again after that yeah yeah that's why it's linear i don't know if it's linear that's why but it's only after you get that point that that solution that you get moved to the next one yeah yeah so the variables in different sessions they have nothing to do with them like variables are always changing in one session let's say to draw the draw the state space yeah yeah and then you change slightly the [Music] parameter evaluate it with you know changing the variable so it's like a for loop within four loop yeah yeah that that i got that ago they were like in capsules yeah yeah yeah yeah it's it's hard no but then the way how you like to explain i think it's like because i think you touch different things yeah yeah yeah i think it's simplified yeah but how about this saddle i didn't go like this the saddle point oh saddle point is um because attractors or a culture are self-explanatory yeah it's because then it's the saddle point it's hard to imagine like as a kind of because attractor and repeller as an analogy it's quite quite self-explanatory like you said but subtle points they're not because it's kind of doing nothing in terms of the attraction of a pool or repair repulsion exactly okay because what happens it's just there and yeah because but anyway there is i mean somebody decide that is there anyway i mean it's only obvious if you draw these curves of fx because the yeah depending on the slope right like the cross section if if it's like i don't know this way or this way that decides yeah um attractor but what happens is like it kind of crosses so it's obvious if it's like going this way or going this way then it's obvious but then sometimes it happens like it's almost like touching the like cross section is like not going this way but it's like touching and then the curve goes down again yeah so actually a slope is zero yeah or like this this is possible too and so there in that diagram there is a point where there is a cross section but if you look at the vector field yeah the vector doesn't change true or at least it goes zero but like if you look at the property as a attractor yeah but the important thing is like that happens when you change the parameter and the repeller and attractor you can see that like with parameters like changing the parameter they kind of come closer closer closer because what happens is like if you have this curve you have this negative slope and positive slope so you have repeller and attractor and then if the curve like if you take some parameter that makes the curve like going down and down and down then what happens is like these two points coming closer and closer and closer and then at one point they which never happens in a cross so there is cross-section but it's just like touching so it's not like crossing but it's like they kind of go like this it's not like penetrating so that's really very specific again the saddle that's a saddle point okay but yeah i mean you can see it as like it's not like a tractor or repeller but it's just like a specific point it it means something when you look at the parameters only look at the parameters but if you look at the variables it will change it doesn't change yeah it won't change nothing yeah yeah significant all right so i think we should close this because there is a recap but maybe i'm not sure we just did a recap yeah i was thinking that maybe i'm not gonna do the recap but maybe i would like to go for a walk that'll be nice yeah wanna go for a walk i will rest of this i think i'm gonna go for a walk yeah let's see it's a good idea i wanted to but i'm not sure if i do it now no i i probably i should work in that letter but i need to i need to write two letters now because after the whole okay okay yeah thank you for watching thank you for watching please like the video subscribe to my channel and write the comments who the are you bye", "XzGSLP1pw9I": "okay so hopefully it's recording fine let's see we'll see i'm having bad reputation these days for recordings record yeah man you love your reputation what happened the problem is like i always change led settings and now it's recording but i set it so that led doesn't flash or something led in the screen there's this indicator on the front oh but i turn it off because there's option to turn it off which is really stupid anyways let's see i hope it's fine i mean battery wise it's fine then it's fine yeah okay we're not gonna talk for like one hour so no although we have so many things to talk welcome now otto to puff thank you we are really happy to have you it's nice to be here yes this time it felt like like when i noticed i was here kind of like because it was like so many things happening before and of course i was planning by myself but it just felt like you know it's not like i arrived but like i'm just sent here and i'm like i'm here you are said like you said like okay there's under there that's a package yeah just like watching a movie and then okay now i'm here right but yeah i feel more relaxed here and yeah today is off quote unquote i i don't think i will take the next one because i know the basics so skip it and then we have the meditation i heard yes that would be nice that's at seven yeah and that would be like uh like soft heart like you know you do uh you use the body to charge the body like with some body practice and then you release it with a lot of energy so you you charge your body softly and then you release really strong and you do cycles on that okay i think it's like that we'll see will be nice so what's been happening oh live so yeah did you have enough rest these days um well like it's getting better being here i think it's it's getting better i don't know if you notice but like for listen i'm having more like today i feel better but like since i arrived i'm like my body started feeling like here i can rest so i'm like just dragging myself because my muscles are like uh so but i think yesterday i crashed at 10 30 and i woke up at 4 35 something like that so i sleep quite long um for yeah like seven hours i think which is long for me yeah that's super long the previous days i think i was sleeping just for hours for maybe two weeks and you were in we were in hamburg you're in hamburg which was the last chat i mean it's official chat but it's a chat yeah it's the frame of the chat it's a chat with public it's a shared chat chat with uh questions and options exactly and the one before i don't remember actually which one i did upload i mean in terms of like it was the one in the in dormant with me with a green shirt i just saw it really yeah oh wow ah in the lab where we did a chat yeah that was nice i saw that the whole one it was nice but that was very nice and we had a nice camera which i don't have anymore you are really that was a nice camera man yeah i was checking because i i borrowed one from my school that's why i was asking you someday and i don't understand how i think it's more at 360 camera for live streaming oh the 360 camera the one that i have is it like because the the storage which is internal no extension is less than 100 gigabytes or something it's like really small yeah so but i was checking i didn't spend too much time but i was checking and it seems more like a something to live stream 360 okay video which i don't understand because but i just see the camera the box is more like that but the camera i meant is the the proper camcorder oh sorry like i think it's called like a home cam no no video cam yeah i like this old school thing you know you open the uh display and i think originally these cameras were made like as a family as a pr product like you're recording your memories and stuff traveling kind of there's always this uh advertisement that parents are holding this and you know chasing the kids in the competition or in the park or whatever going back maybe one second again to the camera this one the 360. what i found amazing that i could still not understand is like the stabilization of that thing is incredible like i haven't experienced for being such a small uh fact format form factor form factor it's just incredible you have this uh what it's called like in cinema these are dolly dolly pants like no like so smooth like when you're walking yeah yeah i don't know exactly how it works but i think because it has 360 like uh reference points everywhere so you can quite accurately find the how to say this vibration or this disturbance or whatever and then just take it away the noise basically yeah that's kind of uh i think it's more like computer vision but yeah i was thinking it should be some i was thinking also they should do some computer edition yeah they just select from all the image what will be displayed yeah that's incredible this has two yeah it's it's quite smooth actually i can show it to you once we did a video walking in vienna i remember we saw the footage after and [Music] okay so what up well i don't know like i just feel like maybe just like update like what where where how long because so the last time we were the last time we were talking about like but basically you were weeks like two weeks before uh finishing your long residence in dormant right right so we were in the lab and we still had all this stuff which we don't have it anymore we don't have the space anymore because we finished officially the project with the floor and hello [Laughter] what so yeah that project was good uh successfully finished we have a lot of footages we have we actually i'm writing the wiki article nice um it's quite interesting i mean of course you know five months of project it's really three something like full time working for five months and then i will i will still write this review on your project oh yeah yeah i will still i have it in my to do really great yeah yeah because i think it's something that can still you know expand like because with floor and i were talking about um how to continue and the next phase obviously we don't have the space anymore and i'll be traveling and we'll have the distance and we collaborate over a distance that's kind of the idea but i think it's also we shouldn't overlook on the yeah reviewing the material and yeah what to do with this what and also what we learned just to write down talk about it also we have this interview video we made oh yeah i want to see that like you can is it online or can you share this with me um it's not so mario he's working at the theater the academy he's editing it right now um but basically i made a annotation like a few days ago actually on the train to paris i was watching the video and annotating like you know every minute this this this and gave him instruction which part to leave which part to take out but i have the original material so okay i can say how how is it like there is no rock so it's like 40 minutes but i think it's a bit too long for dissemination let's say to send it to important people so we have to keep it short but i think the original material is also interesting they have like a lot of details that are very interesting about the project so that's that and the theater digital theater of the householder academy for theater and digitality academy for digital for the um and his daddy case yeah yeah with somebody actually it was a good question because like so now i'm involved in this project with the one in south america so i was writing this thing uh to send to them and then some people uh then i share with somebody who was it like i had the person who holds me in paris she was asking me okay uh so she she got what we were doing you know like and then i can speak to be honest uh with about uh digital dance um but if i saw about digital theater and then she would say no i understand digital dance makes sense but what is digital theater and i was like oh wow that's a good question i don't know what is it is i think it's more complex to try to grasp i mean i don't really know i mean it's a bit i feel like the funny thing with this fellowship or the residency we had is that we were we didn't have a theater right we just had a studio the backstage of the theater of dormant exactly we were never on the stage but it was frameless theater and the selfie which i'm not saying it's good or bad i think it's kind of the interesting question if you think about digital theater because then if you look at for example like halfways project troika fight hello i don't think you're watching but [Laughter] if you're watching don't say that me um no i like him but um so so after we finished the project we were in hamburg and kapha was also there so we were hanging out also we saw his presentation and like his project was like show and shown in berlin but also the performer is in which one was in indonesia no i think thailand thailand i think in thailand yeah because he has collaborated everywhere in asia anyway so they have this separate studio and it's a theater piece but they don't like they have this green screen studio space but it's not the theater that the dancer is performing at and also he's mentioning like this twitch or you know like live streaming which also is not it's not a stage right it's just like your home studio but it can't be a theater but like i would say like somehow then uh that that kind of that's i think taking something as a uh as an example of like digital theater i think kapha is a is an easy example to speak about digital theater because in our case we i think is more like digital dance in on cafes work the stages approach there's a lot of this element of representation which happens very often when you speak about the other the element of representation identities and all these subjects and are at the core of uh of things that i have seen from him so in that regard like theater if you speak classically on theater theater deals a lot with representation yeah and yeah in any case like how he works is like there's theater and there's dance as part of this his theater piece it's not like dance piece no no so why i'm saying oh yeah digital theater and what was that so we were in hamburg this who's watching please comment uh comment below my goodness actually my grandma my grandma oh my grandmother but if you're watching grandma first you won't understand these words but just guys yes um so but no like yeah just to like uh and like yeah around like the john i think was a very nice at the beginning i was a bit acceptable when when i got there and i thought like oh wow there's so many different levels of things in here like not everybody was like uh hands-on technology that was my impression at the beginning i thought it would be a bit difficult to to work but to be honest in the experience of the days that we were there i think i learned so much also listening to these points of view so much yeah so we were like around 20 people well less than 20 people i think like people outside in total yeah let's say yeah people from humble working in hamburg and people outside hamburg and we had this kind of uh yeah curated group i think we were more like close to 15 we were yeah i think so yeah yeah and we had sharing and also kind of more hands-on things like the first workshop we did actually was the first work that we did that actually we invite you to watch ah they kind of watch the workshop because the camera guy he forgot he forgot to record our first workshop which actually ended up being our number of uh practice number hundreds now the first 40 minutes is there oh yeah i guess true it's true yeah that's 20 minutes so look look at here or here or here yeah i think on youtube you can do it here but i'm lazy so i don't do it but sometimes it appears here okay so anyway just like you'll see some link or something that yeah and then there you can see that was our first workshop and what what do you want to say about it how do you yeah let's start from there like this what did we do like let's just describe what happened yeah so we had one hour of practice and then 30 minutes of chat yeah and in the one hour we just started the timer the counting for one hour and as always we at one hour but the difference is that we had other people in the space and also we first explained some nothing rules like code of monday yeah but also like we didn't say anything about like technology or what we do no because that's what someone asked so at some point people ask but i think like the way how we introduced it was very so we were wondering how to do this workshop and then we thought okay let's use this hour for doing a practice from where we started like introducing the body so we do this exercise where people basically get some awareness of the body in the space uh already also then we share some kind of conduct uh where people understand how to interact or not uh uh with uh the space we forgot somehow but now we learn to mention to to leave things as they found it like that was the case of so something to add to the code of conduct is to like well basically not to break things yeah things have to return to the original state basically i mean of course your body cannot because you get no and also i think that doesn't work that much because for reason they're props so if you use for using the balloon you cannot just return the balloon to the initial state of the balloon no but that's the thing like uh if like we can make exceptions if there's constant and those things that will be broken anyways like tape or you know paper but paper can be you know some someone has some kind of precious paper that they don't want to you know tear it to pieces but if there's like a random printing paper you can just do whatever you want to do so i think that's something that we should mention that we should have some kind of concept on you know what you can break or not because um should i say it actually it was this song oh yeah right it's this one that's someone very nice true on the on the sock and uh with a little marker afraid of it but that was like watercolor so i could uh wash it out but but please don't do that anymore did you oh sorry who was the person who did that you know i don't know but john told me that she drew the fish on my tattoo yeah on my leg but hi but that's that was okay because you know you can wash it we know that and the penguins need fish so that's that was great um anyways we start with conduct and then yeah like we just set up like two computers like we do in the performative like hybrid performance but so it was so interesting that people were just like smoothly into uh performance basically and they were just using the space as their own like there was not this like if we think for instance that the time where we were at the impulse dance the last year when we did the first time of a hybrid performance this idea that basically is there is public in it and we are on the same space physical space which normally is not happening because the practice is started as a digital uh or like a net telematic work meaning from normally for me from brussels now to from cologne so in in the at the impulse than the last year what we did and the way how uh people were interacting with there were so much there was so much distance and so much like uh gazing of like what is these guys are doing right but in in in hamburg was so fluid like i think within minutes like people just start like feeling comfortable with the framework until they draw even like the socks but yeah so people were just like absolutely amazing they were so nice yeah and also we mentioned that to ask people to bring an object they want to work with and i think that helps i actually don't know who brought what except the uh kokeshi this you know jan brought this japanese wooden toy right other ones i actually don't know i brought this you know what did i bring i brought my t-shirt i brought uh my makeup i brought them use makeup my uh eye eye shadows but i think in like like what you said is interesting this difference because it's also like we made conscious decision i mean at the impressions we were it was like framed as like a sharing that we do something that we share something although we could have said we do a workshop but back then like we were not even talking about workshop i'm not sure like around that time i think around that time we started like but at the same time i think we just like confronted with this uh challenge of have to communicate a language that we have developed and already we started like talking i guess there back then and i'm so happy actually that the workshop ended up being like that in hamburg because as i shared with you i was quite stressed like thinking of maybe i was over engineering things in my head like or also in terms of concept like i want really people to you know to get with this idea of like uh the strategies rather the content and all these kind of uh conceptual uh approach to the practice that i shared when we did our formal presentation uh which by the way we didn't mention that so the format that we have is like we propose a workshop which was for the uh 20 or the 15 participants which in a way all of them they are somewhat more or less related and they know how to work with technology so from that point of view they could be kind of like an so we have this workshop and then i think three days after two days after we have a formal presentation that was open to the large public in which we have just seven minutes officially but they end up being like 10 minutes i think uh to speak about so just like a proper classical presentation of 10 minutes where people speak and share their work and it was the first time that we decided to do a chat in this way of like kind of like just really presenting and telling a linear in a way uh story but but i think we did a good job and i approached it more like conceptually tried to put the slides in that way and then now auto came with a more loose but it's still uh executive way to present cooperative cooperative like with that ted talk and i work out i think very well i'm very happy about it yeah yeah i was a bit like afraid of like kind of repeating because you had your part i had my part but we didn't really like put content together but i think it also works that it is so you know complex and rich thing that we always want to like add more things to it when we present but people won't really get it i mean not not that people are smart or stupid but it's just like it's too much it's a lot of fear we first like encounter this it's hard to understand i think it's good like we take like a different path to explain our experience and what we yeah how we see the project with the about this practice and that that also is like the the core of the practices because i think it's more like that i think that was very honest because that's the way also how we approach it very much totally like then and that's the way how we also do applications like yeah like uh we help each other in in things in these things that's the way how we we approach it uh if i will do an application alone or if you will doing the application alone we will be lacking this other part that the other person can kind of uh we so we have found this way so it was what i'm saying is that it it was honest it was very honest and it's not far away of the way how we are approaching applications and series well work and yeah by the way i was um for other projects i started reading um some of my journals and like long emails to to a friend and i at one point i was writing that i think around this time of year last year that we were writing with joanna a bit earlier actually and it seemed i was super stressed because it felt like you know in the end it was good like how it worked i mean the application didn't go through but i think it was really interesting exercise but i think i had a lot of like conflict or like you know kind of feeling in between like same as like when we were working with floor that yeah it's just like when we were three of us like think this balance this asymmetry becomes more way more complex like three body problems that's reported product absolutely you cannot solve it yeah so this we are back here by the way like on the framework of this chaos theory workshop which is a very complex subject by the way it's a very complex object um and it's very chaotic um yeah so totally you know going back to um what you're saying i think that for instance with joanna the things were like so so smooth afterwards like uh i really appreciate that we have that exercise we didn't go the grunt but what we growed as part of the publication yeah that i have like some selection um i really enjoyed that that that time that we spent with her and at the end it went fluid because there was some conflict before yeah so like for instance if i don't want to go personal as well let's try to not be a person like so i was invited by now autumn floor to be their mentor on their project in the academy so i was with you guys like for 12 days i think yeah uh in a really fancy hotel by the way i still i don't understand why i could not receive more money and less fancy hotel anyway just anyway just um that um i i i remember that i think like in the experience for me like i went with this idea of like okay now autumn floor are working already i visited you guys like i think one month before a bit more than one month before no even earlier like march or something like early it was winter it was cold um because yeah so i went to visit you guys and then you have somehow this stage but a lot of artifacts and a lot of concept around this uh what it became at the end this internet browser somehow but in the physical space um so there was a lot going on a lot of experiments that you guys were doing per week and uh as a research more as a lab but then when i came so since i came back then and then when i arrived i already was thinking like in my in the time that i'm there also because we were colliding with olivia jack olivia if you're saying this it's super nice to meet you your dog is so cool i i i keep on seeing her yes stories and she's she was traveling with her dog and so cute who is her name cuba cuba so freaking cute it's a colombian dog colombia unite us anyway in the coming months we will have from colombia more of these conversations anyway so uh so we have a really short time to originally the idea was to work how many weeks like originally what we thought four weeks like a month yeah yeah yeah and at the end so we did like i was there 12 weeks 12 weeks i was there 12 days and and olivia was there for a few days so we would like i think you were quite um ambitious with the many things but at the end we did so many things yeah we did so i i realized that we did so many things um but what i'm trying to share is that so i arrive and then i have this agenda like my agenda was like to share with you guys like my experience on on on being on stage basically so sharing my experience on uh on the body on stage and yeah that was that was at the core for me uh without the need to like refer you guys too much to text or like going to uh research of the body um specifically before i thought back then i thought to use the book that i was using and and motion bang this about choreographies uh drawing uh choreography or something like that that it was like uh this book big book that i at some point i share with you guys and the whole idea of the book is this uh sense making and so yeah it i think it was great like we tried right away practicing so one thing to say is like because and we having we so flora now to have a practice and now to myself we have a practice and we basically we share a lot of the i guess strategies how we approach the work when i came and we started jamming was like i was there with you from the beginning like it was very smooth the way ho you didn't we didn't have to explain now we do this and this from the beginning was just really smooth but then after we start our proposed like uh let's do this without elements because uh it was important for me for like for you guys to to to yeah there was an idea how to approach this body um and understand timings uh intentionality representation if so and i think it was great i was happy like we did that what i thought it was very complicated to do we did it i think in three days i was very when we have this discussion after i think three four days when we were sitting at the back that i shared with you guys i thought like for me what i really wanted to share uh i thought it was achieved and and then after we olivia arrived and then dome and then uh rotterdam even oh we went to cologne yeah like to colonel so ah colombo is amazing also thanks christian thanks christian if you're watching i think this is like we're repeating this like at the disc just watching this [Laughter] seriously who's watching but i get like always like you know 10 views or something like who are you yeah please somebody said who are please for real identify yourself anyways one is me for sure maybe me like 10 times i'm clicking no that doesn't work like that no i don't know you need to really open or being like uh incognito things like that yeah i think so so no i don't know i could be maybe twice it could be maybe twice me yeah no like always get one or two likes so i like it you like it not always not always i like it but like normally i would like it yeah anyways so we had a lot of things a lot a lot like really like if you really think so like in 10 days i share the politics of i i share my my foundings in dance my i i share my foundings in the public the body on stage of 15 years in three days i was really happy from what i mean on your work because i was applied on your work so in three days i was satisfied with what we got and from then then olivia orca happens we are like super excited now with this new uh live coding environment that is called orca developed by 100 rabbits [Music] then starting like working more really coding uh we blend live lab and hydra in a more performative way already you have proposed that live love you you create already you put together live hydra inside of hydra at some point no yeah so olivia made this version of live lab embed wait wait look is embedded in live lab that you can use video streams from different people in like directly into hydra so you don't have to do screen sharing and stuff and you can that code is shared with the other person so you see actually the same thing but it's not like streaming it but the hydra is like taking same videos and doing all this hydra stuff i don't get it same way i don't get that still i don't understand how it works but it's okay because i was trying to understand that while we were there and i think like no no no i cannot do that that and other things at the same time so i didn't understand how it worked it worked i was very nice actually like because like she came with something but then we pull it like the last thing that we have was very okay before we have to refresh some things constantly but then afterwards you open and was working yeah yeah you guys use that thing also for the for the workshop you gave right did you use that or not the working that was just walk but then like i decided to so i don't know if yeah we this workshop in the dome and basically like floor explained you know how hydra works and you know like some small uh code snippets so people can start editing the code and then in the end we go in we went glory surrounded the dome and open the flocked session so everyone's like sharing the same screen and coding with each other but the difference from the normal look is we made it so that like you know you have this like two by two thing but in the dome it's better if it's like a full screen instead of like divided into like squares yeah so i made a small script to cycle through different renders so like first one is like the old zero output is there after after a few seconds it switched to one line but on your computer you see the overview of everything so you can just you know focus on and on your computer you will see the grid yeah yeah just on the dome okay nice yeah yeah i don't know like maybe we should try to close soon because there is this workshop of mathematics fundamental mathematics that is there is part of this chaos theory because i know it yeah because you are engineering um enjoy i think i will do but i will see because the thing with puff is that now that you have to share space so then something becomes very convoluted because of the levels are so different so uh we'll see i mean certainly i'm a beginner also i know i guess some fundamental things from from just coding so like just having this math math reference of mathematics will be interesting yeah yeah yeah i think it's good yeah and yeah okay so there are more things coming but we can come back on this yeah because uh we have to talk about what happened in the workshop and stuff we just didn't talk about in hamburg yeah yeah yeah yeah and then they continue what's happening here and all the all these things like the future also that we have to talk about colombia there are so many things happening i'm going to cern like there's so many things happening uh electronic is coming also now to our spanish [Music] [Laughter] hello i really want to show this to my grandma let's do it okay okay please subscribe and the 10 people who are watching please comment comment something yeah like i mean you don't have to comment but but just but i appreciate it yeah because it's just we don't know who is these people i know one people anyway so bye bye", "yd4qPqeaHQQ": "okay oh hello [Music] good morning how are you [Music] a bit tired who was yesterday what was yesterday no yesterday was nothing [Music] the day before we had the guests i mean uh from the school yeah i thought it was yesterday so it was one day before yeah and that went well he was really interesting christian the teacher it was it was so funny he was so um into the the oscillator you know this pattern like the stripes that we always use yeah and he started to like analyze well obviously that's kind of uh really present in the space and then he started like analyzing you know like this is like continuous gradient without an edge that i don't know implies something right it goes well with this like smooth paper yeah it also doesn't have the doesn't have an edge yeah but but i guess like the guy has a point you know like i was thinking that you know with hydra you can do so many things but at the end just very fast go into madness right that if you find the right not too much thing that works for whatever you need to to do with it so if you find that not too much thing that is performative in respect to what what you're doing then you have something [Music] that is communicative that's what i'm trying to say like because it's so is if if the matter is trying to communicate with other people then reducing the glitches works so i'm saying this is just because i can understand yeah like why just the entry oscillator works you know it's just simple depending what are you using that for it might be just that but you need although you can do so many things and i think in that regard is no different than in dance like great dancers like actually when i learned that when i was like 20 something that choreographers they want to work normally with uh more mature dancers because although they say that physically maybe they might not be in the in their peak but already mentally they are mature so maybe they don't need to do the four pilots but maybe they just do one and that was enough because they do it it just works for what they need um so it's just this idea of the technique and then what are you using the form [Music] what is the purpose of the forum no yeah it totally makes sense and this this should be the the public chat this should be uploaded i know we have to do some uh office stuff but i don't know yeah we just continue with the public chat or we could we can continue with the public chat for a little bit yeah let's do it yeah yeah so i was uh looking at your uh how do you say it report journal paper yeah i think i think the good name is like journal journal yeah yeah like in terms of like uh because it's funny like this word journal is like one can be like my journal like i write about myself but on the other hand in the journal can be like academic journal which is like a like a com yeah compiled uh text of yeah academic papers yeah which is also a journal which is like completely like different end of the spectrum and yours can be like both at the same time so i i wrote to you or i sent you a message before but basically i looked into it and then i think i thought like if well we know that if we want to publish a paper from this i think we need to like really work we need to work on it so i just went through and uh put like little editing just for the gram grammar or like this yeah so it really small stuff so that it might help if you put it online but i didn't go through the content because that's something well maybe we can talk about it now but uh yeah i feel like it's so interesting but also this this idea of communication is really difficult i guess also depends on who you want to talk to or like who's what's the [Music] context of this uh the target audience right and but i also feel like whoever the audience is like you have to explain a lot of things a lot of background because if you start with the idea of someone who already know about tech and dance that's like really limit limiting the audience right so you have to like if it's for tech people you have to explain a lot about dance dance or choreography and if that's for dance people or if it's for dance people it's even more difficult because the answers are like going every time that you mention something you have to tell them you have to mention what is it what is not yeah what is that designer what are those lines what's the coordinate space oh my god imagine wow imagine that yeah so yeah but uh but i i definitely think that was it's a good idea to do this uh this exercise of the interview uh because that would be the easiest way to work actually together on that um yeah and then we can take our time and how we do that um then we don't have to force ourselves like okay there's a deadline um right in terms of like what is the paper yes as i mentioned then i just need to upload something in medium yeah i will do it as fast as i can uh i mean in between two three weeks is where i will have the uh i would like to work on the comments and then do something with it and then after so then another thing is like work on the paper like i use a classical paper with florian and i don't know how realistic is this but i would like to have a finished version that i can submit to the academic open call in the festival de la marin which is the 5th of august i have no experience working on this in this context so i don't know how how realistic is this i have to see i have no idea i mean also depends on who you're working with and how much time you have and yeah yeah yeah like what if i remember like when when i have like this small feedback at the end when we have this conversation with florian he said like when we talk about like okay maybe you should just write a completely uh different paper from this and but he was underlying he said like you have it there but just you have it basically in the conclusions he was saying and he said like just uh we have to do it i think that would be his approach more like what you found from conclusions basically yeah so taking away a lot of the in between i guess a good introduction and then conclusions uh that's the way how i felt it yeah you need to kind of find the yeah the conclusion like what you're aiming for and then based on that you have to build the story the narrative yeah and uh yeah i really see like this the journal you have is like uh it's like a salad bar that you have like all these things already there but you have to put it on your plate and you have to present it nicely yeah and and already in this in in what i present already i took away a lot of compromising things you know like complicate things around annotations and scores i found a way to just like say like yeah i do the decisions were good with annotations something simple like that but not really going deep into i mean things that i growed uh in the previous version that i extend a lot in trying to explain something that was that we mentioned that once we were like talking like at 11 and mines but we were trying to talk about these ideas i just remember this uh plushie in the background this uh cow or something yeah yeah yeah so i and i did it so i took away some a lot of this stuff and also some personal remarks like um about like yeah some things so i was trying to just like make it just uh i guess quite technical somehow [Music] not getting too much into the other domain because then otherwise it means that i have to really explain myself what does that mean and that's not the point what i'm doing right now at least in that paper in that paper uh yeah yeah i think it's also but it's also good to like keep some of the text that's like your notes like when you discover something you just write it like really like a personal way instead of like kind of um reflection of what happened but okay like this happened yes like this but i think it's really like good to keep it uh like somewhere in the paper like just a kind of site it's like more like citing your journal inside the article to kind of trace what you what you found what was the frustration um because i think that's also kind of like really valuable part of the story that like what is your discovery like and how you found like how why you had the frustration uh and how you solved it because that's kind of overlooked in academic research often like you have to spend time on annotation or cleaning up data and people don't really mention that uh but it's actually a valuable process especially when you are artist and i don't know technologist or programmer at the same time yeah this is funny because then so i have this interview with uh with uh the performance in liens and that's electronica on monday and then so when we were talking and discussing about the budget then they said okay so this is the budget um if you want to if you want to move more budget one way will be if you take care also the programming and development and i was like no i'm not gonna do that uh because and this is still com it comes from my experience being in motionband i felt like that would become something else i don't want to do that i just want to be three months thinking of course i will be involved and then i guess working close with a developer uh but i don't want to do that process like i want to focus in in the and the choreographic aspect like uh yeah and this i think comes from the experience with this this is one of the conclusions by the way in that paper it says like if there is a budget like i said if in projects that involve dance and technology like you must have budget to pay for somebody else who's dedicated in in clean and clear disservices if what you're working towards is a deadline let's say you know if it's like for instance in our case like we are both things and it's until it's the proposal let's do this so it's an ontological process we don't really have a deadline but if you have a goal and there is some deadline then i there should be budget for somebody who is worried and and working on that then it gives freedom and a space for the artist to just do the artistic thinking we think within understanding because again that's part of this was one of one of the things that i saw in the paper at the beginning but i guess i did not develop like one of my early proposals or it was an assumption was saying that that there is a difference between uh the choreographer who uses services from a technologist as a translator and so so a person who doesn't really speak the language um and then uses a third person as a translator with the the choreographer developer the one who can uh [Music] yeah take the two the bo two rolls at the same time so i think that's that i think it's like that put it at the beginning of the paper maybe actually i can just put i can just see it and because it says it's it's it's early and when i was in berlin when i was proposing what i'm gonna do okay oh yeah yeah yeah so it says choreographing thinking don't do remark mapping process myself having a background in dance and with the current knowledge in technology i am trying to prove that the act of dance the choreographic thinking during dances affect the mapping values being the dancer and the coder at the same time influence the mapping process if so then coding mapping after dances leads to an embodied code which is like a big war basically and and that was the way why i started like i was trying to prove that being developer and being the choreographer it should lead to embodied code which are words that we use very often also in a framework but then how you can prove that right um so i put it at the beginning um but so i didn't follow up really into that but what's up with that but what i what is what i i did found is and it's one of the conclusions like dude if you can avoid to be in that in that entangled you should avoid it or you or i think there are two things that i'm kind of trying to say here one is that um it's about i think this is that this is an interesting thing i think for our framework is like this is a postulate that i think that this is what we're working we're saying that we um voting code the that we work towards embodied code uh if so then how you know how can you argue that and then you need to find good arguments conceptually and technically right and then communicate them and following them up uh in uh i get in a yeah maybe i don't want to use the word classical sense but in a scientific way or an academic way then the other people can follow and can basically can uh maybe uh argue and yeah i think that's the kind of difficult part of your research that it's like in a more like a classical sense you have to find the best practices right that you want to say that okay here's the best practice if you want to work with capturing and uh vr for example but i think more of the like the statement is that you show how you worked with it like worked on it like it's it's a process and it's like not the way how you visualized or like how you set up the system but it's about like how you how what was the progress and like how you deal with like when you face technical problems or like how you bypass something with uh uh i don't know like like you always have technical problems and then you know it can be solved with movements or can be solved by using other program but this kind of way of working with two different like you have to navigate through the move like choreographic thinking and the technical perspective yeah that's that is the practice i think but but i think like so going back to what i was saying the thing is and then uh i was that's why i was uh referring to this interview with the performance with the happiness capital university in linz is because so when they asked me we were negotiating about this uh budget right and then i wanted to understand like okay what do you guys want is this a service that i'm providing where i'm just delivering the performance what are the expectations these things that we took at your house back then in durham so it was very very clear the way ho they basically said that they don't really understand what i mean that basically they're trying to do uh they're trying to approach the project within and on what i believe so that is an honest way to trying to integrate arts and science where as an artist i'm not just delivering a service to uh to use aesthetics into something that i don't understand right scientific science but the rather they try to just really put the artist and then try and so in being in conversation with the artists and then the engineers and then they as academics uh seem basically they seem as a as a third person who is following the process and that's part of a theory and the the sense-making theory that claudia the head of this uh phd research um she writes about one of the things that she writes in her paper is like in this sense making process [Music] when you are in the intersection of art and science since both people have different uh expectations one it's good to have a case of use clearly you know that you know that you are developing a robotic arm or a a robot a tattoo robot uh arm for instance like you have a case of use where it liberates so it's what we use this sentence of like it just is a way to bypass the politics you know you don't have to get into like nitty gritty of is this a good idea is it a bad idea say somebody else put it there if somebody else put it there for you it's actually even better because you're just there called to work so engineers or scientists and artists they come both towards working into something that it might not be their their first thing so there's one thing like you need a case of few seconds um if possible more actually if you are at the beginning of this sense making processes uh we think uh or transdisciplinary processes you need a third person who actually works as a mediator between the two um yeah um they she also said and she would you argue afterwards that it doesn't have to be always necessary but it just it will help very much the production line and everything uh from both perspectives um because the people feel they will it's easily speak out right like which is the problem that we have in dance and technology when you think about technicians and artists the people don't and that's more in relation with technicians technicians don't speak out because they're hired by the artists so normally there is this status of the artist knows and the technician doesn't know so they are the technician normally is not really speaking because it doesn't have this strain this the sense making process uh which is defining basically is in a social relationship basically how we in groups we make sense of the environment we are and we define maximums and minimums and things that how we interact basically in different contexts i think that's the core of that it's just the way how we make sense of things and how we incorporate and without speaking to each other said like this is normal this is not normal and when somebody comes new to the team we understand this is weird or not without the need to ask because we are saying we are making sense for two years together so i think that's at the core of sense making and so yeah so by going back to this uh maybe just to make it sure it is so then you it's easy when you have a third person then brings agency for engineers and for the artists they can just speak out and this person in the in between it has to modulate the speech to take things away and then to communicate but the person thinks it must be communicated so cloudy argue after in this in this research paper that um it's not necessary like she just said like if people have already experienced in this sense making between art and science then perhaps they can do it by themselves so they can start talking to each other and ideally that will be that will be a more direct way because there is no uh meta information lost because there is no selection of what information should pass right right um but nevertheless again she's going back and say like if it's just more practical you know if you have a deadline then going back to this if you have a deadline there's a production line and stuff like and there's much money budget just allocate some money for the third person who can take care of that and i'm saying that in regards to then we were again to what i started talking about uh the budget and they were asking me we can pay you more if you want to take care of the development right and then i thought like first thing was like no you know like no no no no because of the experience actually motion bank and then i thought like i would just actually just take care of the artistic thing i also speak the language so it will be i guess a close collaboration with the development team but uh yeah it's not gonna be my call but after i was thinking also when we finished the conversation and then i was thinking that this seems like uh a great opportunity for me to experience uh art and science in a different way who i have experienced so far with seeds for instance uh it seems like a very honest as i call honest way how they're trying to approach this with claudia they for instance like they don't know even if they want to open the performance for public because they will go very slow they will just go very slow and in communication with the artist and then the engineers and basically they will be in a way like leading but constantly in conversation so there are no things define it which is close to how we work in art right but they do have a deadline so that's why i decided to if for instance if the process will be open-ended and said like i will have instead of three months six months or a year i will say like maybe i'll be interested in taking part of the development as an ontological research and going back to actually but you and me are interested right the embodied embodied machine that's the framework of this one specifically the embodied machine but because there is just at three months uh time it's just not it's not it's not going to be the case it's not practical right i mean again it depends on what you have to deliver deliver like is it like a product or is the research as a outcome that's maybe that then it's okay like how we work basically but also we have the yeah like the people uh how they say the funders or whatever that's the framework of their funding so i guess you have to deliver something yeah that works like so now now it was clear for instance that they have three performance and one is like already is happening and the second one at the end of the december and the next one uh before of june so the first one actually is just i mean i'm using my own words right they have their own words and she was very picky and repeating you know like she has their own words are being uh argued in a paper right so i'm just using my interpretation of what they said the first one is in a way like to create awareness of uh those who are not yet work uh not only with robots but with what they call digi twins this digital representation of human tasks basically and so first is like create awareness with different stakeholders and and then they take performance performers as the people who are gonna interact with the systems so this is for sure is not gonna be open and they are in this process now of working with different systems not necessary only with robots but it's just different things the second one is focus on aesthetics and and that will be where like if you want to call it like the artistic thing in a way can be or the form shape uh the artistic uh the focus is on our own aesthetics and art and the third one that is when i'm gonna participate it seems there is the most complex because it's where i call it seems to me that is like they're trying to create of the third one an emergent experience uh where the systems they have and they still are also negotiation with who is gonna also what are they uh which labs are collaborating then i know which what is the tech writer basically for me to start thinking so but basically they want them to work in close collaboration with the artists and and the engineers to create something that not necessary has to be a performance either not necessarily has to be a performance for people to see that has to be seen on the process but the performance should uh work as a way to help to see people who are working with the systems that they are different way to approach these systems these machines basically and that there is uh something that they can take from the artistic from my artistic experience basically so there is if then when there's public so other scientists so people who are not involved in the project but people who are going to be invited so the stakeholders so that those people and they're putting from an executive level that they see the potential of why this actually there is something artistic is actually mean can mean something and can be actually transferred into capital sense or uh yeah economical profit or productivity uh yeah so i guess their challenge is like and that's what they're trying to do honestly they're trying to find how to just not create a product uh but how they can be in close collaboration and try to create something that is meaningful for those who are involved within a kind of prototype yeah basically yeah that she was using the word prototype very much yeah yeah and then for me it works because i so i see it like the last one is like an entanglement of a choreography like it's a comp is a complex in a way it reminds me what you guys are doing with with floor but then with um yeah in a different context but like a complex setup different setups uh and then perhaps i started imagining a parkour somehow yeah and the difference is that they have to somehow land somewhere that is a prototype yeah the difference is like they should be they should we are aiming to or does the goal and is clear is that it should clearly communicate to the stakeholders that actually the this marriage of art and science can uh open doors new doors for those who actually have to work because the people who are going to come that executives i guess most of them so are the people who in a way they have to invest in technologies and so on and policies so they're not going to work with the technologies but what they have to see is like those who are going to operate the technologies and so on the digital twins of those humans they so the the executive level should understand that there is potential why is this art interesting in that realm yeah i mean we have it's a bit similar question let's say that now like i'm working with floor for three months and then we still have two months left and kind of it's more question for myself it's like how can we sell this that we have this five months of research and then like it's good we did research we have a lot of like content sketches and all kinds of things but then practically speaking we have to think about like is it something that we can send it to curator and they'll be interested in like having exhibition or is it something like a performance but it has to have some kind of you know like communicate somehow exactly entry point to them yeah and it's different for people from theater or people from you know gallery or people from conference and we have to somehow kind of narrow down the or like the format what we do as a researcher so the text we have but we have to somehow like re-format it because like for example like john uh john we always talk about uh we're in touch with like she's really open and she's really like interested in this kind of open-ended research and she was also found co-founder of the ccl choreography coding lab so like she has this spirit but not everyone's like that so we have to yeah absolutely that's not the norm yeah thank you chan anyways yeah and in your case it's a bit like different kind of level but it's a same idea i guess i think but it helps a lot i mean i think what it helps very much is like so because we are talking about the same like you know like so this makes maybe the different like the uk lag i guess you guys want to sell that or like move on with that like i think in in claudia's more like she finished and normally after she i guess she will write a book or something like that but um it's that's it it's a project of phd project that it has some expectations at the end there will be some conclusions and that's it um but in terms of like uh policies and the executive level for instance um basically we both want to uh i guess attract people and the people basically unders not only attract but the people understand us that's what is completely that i think that's what we're talking here about like the people understand what does it mean what does this complexity mean basically basically and i think what it makes it easy if you want to say like for claudia is that claudia has been working on this i think eight years you have to think about that so she has all the fundamentals like in terms of papers and you know like classical knowledge sense i would say academic and the credentials to uh call for attention um [Music] so you guys are in a different and we are in that place also with you and me like we are just in that sense i think you and me we have a bit more of room than you and floor uh because we are being more consistent in that and just now after two years we start seeing okay this we are getting more fluid in the way how we do things how we at i i i do applications the way how everything goes is more smooth now because there is a lot of different things that we can do also the way hor or minds work are very flexible now we can for instance we talk about this paper every time like we see like you know what but we can actually use this as a case we use for that and we are getting very flexible in how we can connect all these nodes and so yeah i think this is just something that it we have to take in consideration that you guys have been working in something that is very specific now um it's physical what you guys are doing is comp is is completely different than what you guys were doing before in a way like i mean you guys work physical like in the space and even so although is with in with some internet tools and stuff the physical component like you guys are working on sonography basically uh yeah but yeah but yeah like kind of going back to your journal like that or like article idea or about our best practices as well like there's like same question that like what do we want to sell and i think we're getting better at this but still like it's not really clear like who is the person that we want to sell this to or like if you want to talk about like best practices like what do we actually want to yeah what do we actually want to sell or like what's what's valuable because we have so many things that are we think it's valid and it is but then what what is what is it in a nutshell like it's a queer conversation for uh oh my gosh it's a form of conversation between technology and bodies but then what what is it like like what is it something like that like what does it mean like yeah exactly what does that mean you know like what yeah also like you understand that you know like what would be amazing is like if we can say that and after following up about something that is you know like that that people that we don't have to extend you know when when i'm introduced that i always said it's a queer form of conversation between computers and and the body science and technology and then i then from there i go i say like we said it's queer because and or i will moderate my speech because when we mention this i have learned this in the past from questions you know what do you mean with queer for instance that was one of the questions that i have in mind so like uh the last saturday in the deaf on the dance where we present a hybrid version of the chat by the way i think the chat should just be this man i don't know why can't we we should just do this why can't it be we should just basically neglect the people i think would be easy but it's difficult like but we are not doing this like when we bite a third person i think i think that we're talking about wait we no let's not get out of here right over here later um no so so the in the background the dance we have this uh hybrid chat somehow um asymmetric chat and then so when i introduce this as a queer form of conversation then i start right away after saying about we said that it's clear because of this and this and this and then i start getting into something that is more complex so um would be amazing if we could just like because i still think it is it makes sense uh for me what it is what what it there is a queer form of conversation um but then what the does that mean for other people you know like how we can translate that into something that my grandma understand that w you know actually that we should do that like we should put like i speak from the practice not for the article not from my research but uh i think in best practices i think we should go towards like my grandma understand from one sentence what is that we do yeah if my grandma understand then we are fine yeah that you have to make like brown like colombia man so much so now we're going to colombia in september and then so i hopefully also will be there and so then and we'll do a chat then with my grandma oh my god [Music] so i guess uh we're gonna close the chat here and yeah yeah better if you watching you uh watching you watching this uh have better phrase better uh uh line than the queer form of conversation between the technology and what is please comment in the chat please we'll steal it [Laughter] um yeah and thanks for watching please like the video and subscribe to my channel also that it will be yes it will be in in i'm part of like naoto's friends channel so please subscribe check out the other channels and you can follow for his uh channel yes and you can see that all the capturing stuff yes and actually that's coming is upcoming that i will be the only person in youtube that can offer um for free so far um [Music] the playlist of uh paxton uh oh i always call this video i forgot again material for my material for the spine of uh steve paxton it will be coming in the coming weeks it will be available on my youtube channel i have to check that out yeah so cool and all right follow us and see you in the next chat", "8auz28CsLRQ": "we are just getting into space so [Music] hello everyone hello class um [Music] got it okay cool uh maybe you can introduce this short text that is about in a nutshell what is this that we do if you want auto yeah sure i can start so i'm naoto i'm in dortmund right now i just read a text that i've when we start around the time we started the practice we discussed what could be the best practices in contemporary dance it is not like a simple response to contemporary dance where every dancer has different practices and is often self-referential but also it's a proposition to explore contemporary dance in a systematic or more like to theorize what we do through the best practices and specifically in network performances or net art not many dancers or artists or actually no one knows how to practice and embody the practice or like develop bodily expressions through camera and screen in contemporary dance we know we go to the studio and we know the process but if it comes to network we don't know well at the time we the pandemic started at least and i think still we don't know and we believe that we need to we need a slow process just like how we practice in a dance studio it's not like we switch this on switch that on and you have 30 minutes of recording but we need some kind of slow process for example this is like a yeah this is an online analogy of a studio space that's what we wanted to create through this practice with jorge and also another aspect of this practice is that we imagine something like a weekly tv show which was kind of also the idea of the best practices at first that we meet every week let's say every uh thursday at 8pm just like a tv show that you would just tune in and people can watch just like what's happening right now here in the background in my studio and also in where you are at we have two pillars of best practices one is practice that is like this practice with the body and video and network between us and another pillar is this format which we call chat or hashtag chat that we talk about what happened in the practice and yeah that's what we are trying to do today hopefully and it's not going to be success or fail and we like to fail yes thank you now so much for for the introduction uh you haven't met properly and elena so here's elena hello uh class we met vienna the impulse dance [Music] so yeah i think but i want to underline somehow what we do in a way is that we propose a space and we have been working on that uh that proposes vulnerability and it deals with uncertainty and not knowing basically um so how could we and this was when we were invited to the festival in frankfurt uh it was in essen no and you know in the festival the media that we're we proposed elsewhere and these formats and we were trying to not have to go in the classical sense of have to show our credentials and to show why are we worth it or what is that we do that is so good that we have to be there but rather we just propose a space where we share in a vulnerable state about what we do without pretensions so this this the chat that we propose it's basically the space where we try to understand what is this about that we do and around also dance and technology and moreover art and science so basically is when we come and try to talk achieve as still as possible so um this is the second time that we are doing this in this format just so you know in public in public yeah uh and we having i think this is the eighth the eighth time that we have guessed the that we bring guests into the chat and then we just talk together about uh the practice and other topics so maybe something that i found super interesting to talk about right now is uh you know like this collision what is like i don't know like if it's a straight line from art and science to like art and designing like for instance like like now we propose if we think that the program there was uh there was a dj set and then after the dj said between two dj sets there was kontan was proposing uh some sound uh performance so the framework of the of the of the sound performance is quite different than that the dj set right like well while in the dj set you will be more i guess yeah more party or more happy in that sense i guess in uh us i will speak personally what i have experienced in sound immersives or live visual performances you go more into an introspection when you try to get touched by the waves and all these sounds that are proposed by the artist i'm bringing this now because i think it's interesting so it's nobody's fault like oh why is it working why people were not paying attention why it's just part of of how we're dealing with this um basically we're trying to put things together between like make things we're trying to be happy i guess together you know sharing spaces uh but at the same time then introducing art proposals but then it's it collides it's very difficult which is the case i think in art and science also um yeah i don't know maybe i was thinking also that we could talk perhaps what does it mean to be an artist this day like understanding this complexity you know like if is it the dj in an artist like in indonesia was an artist or is like a sound artist an artist no uh what does it mean to be an artist these days like maybe around this topic i would like to maybe talk a little bit i think what is the most um coming forward is not necessarily to see what is the difference but to see what is the similarity between both this i find always or for me is a way that is more a bit more uh clear [Music] to to get to get new information so if you see there is you the dj is also physics he keeps going on there is like a generative process going on there and then with with every very often when you have to deal with the item technology there's going to be a very generative aspect to it also so this is something that brings the two together there is not a very clear beginning and there is not a very clear ending is more a proposal of an environment what you say where you can image yourself um and that is not to say okay but what is the difference because i don't think there is necessarily a difference uh it is it is it is as blunt as to say it's it's a space and a time thing for me it can be both uh the same thing if you put it in another space or we make it clear in time then it becomes something different [Music] yeah i think for me what's or the interesting part is maybe a code with the audience but it's always so clear like when i go into a party setting i have kind of the agreement with the person at the table that we are gonna have like this shared kind of space and that it's gonna be physical and it's that i'm invited to use my body in a nice special quote and then i really like for example myself i like to push this to see what can i do an unpreviewed performance in a club like you know like you have a club setting and people think it's gonna be this cold it's gonna be me dancing and somebody is making sound for me that it's moving that i can use my body and then when you break this frame or when you start to play with it and you propose something more hybrid or something more deconstructed in this sense then suddenly there is this a bit confusion but i think the confusion then is in me as the audience and the public like to when it's not clear anymore what's what's my frame what's what's the code now and do you see that as a positivity like this i mean myself as a performer i love it as an audience member i'm not so sure if i love it in the theater it's the same you know you go you know i have of course there are other formats that usually you sit you watch in front and somebody's doing something for you and then these formats are broken or deconstructed so i am i have to to always in every moment of the performance i have to reflect what is my position on who am i in this setting now which as an audience member of course is different than doing it and for me as a performer as a for example in the dj being able to receive something very physical but i can move my body and to uh and the aspect of sound forms or more digging or more like very sound and playing with like very very soft or very loud noises and stuff so to constantly break and i also don't think when you to go back to your question when he's an artist today i think what i find always problematic is this thing of artists or non-artists for me i have a problem [Music] and so i like to go with this performance and set to places where it's not expected to happen because i think this or this is where for me the friction happens that it's becoming interesting when something happens in a space that it's not supposed and that's supposed to happen thank you for the phone i think that's supposed to happen no no no so i think what one of the things uh what i found interesting in the framework that we work with now is that um we fail at some point so we started working i think for four months without knowing what we were doing at some point we were invited for this festival of notes uh and frankfurt uh and then we were actually it was the first time that we went out and myself we met and then we were working towards doing a performance and we were like really trying to do it and then we really failed so it was not good at all i mean it was not good and then but what was interesting from that point and is that uh we knew from that moment on that we didn't have to actually to do something we just have to practice we didn't have to change anything from what we were doing and i'm saying that in regards to failing you know and or achieving or scoring or which is connected with science uh in that sense of uh um reductionism and naturalism in the wake or normally you have to prove uh and measure basically uh the approach to something um i rather i think it's more interesting so i'm gonna propose what i think is or whatever we propose is rather than proposing something we propose the conditions for something to happen so that happens only in the moment that that happens before and after is something different and it actually liberates itself from the politics of doing good or wrong because it's just a practice and then some failing is absolutely good okay so i don't know how you see this this for instance this idea within your research class i'm very curious but i'm also stepping away more and more of this idea of creating choreography and coming closer to through installation but to go into a space where you have an environment where you can not not even consciously break what you call the phones or the frames that are installed that you see okay uh also connecting it to the uh independent things but for me today uh to be a host of this uh it starts from the moment the first person at ten o'clock and we will stop there and there is a fundraiser of all these things together um so it helps me a lot to go really microscopic because or else you completely lose yourself and you get stuck in asking questions which are predefined for you without even knowing that you're dealing with things that are already pre-defined so to take as far away microscopic space and just say okay i want to bring people together and how do i want the space to activate people and what is the social dynamic that i want to create in that and this for me and to use digital technology for that is a very grateful way why because you were bound to frames so in a way with choreography itself i said okay i want to take the stream of what would have to be or has been choreography i want to take that but at the same time [Music] replacing what i find problematic by actually multiplying it by multiplying these defined problematic different because the data the the main words that we always come back to when we research together are very open and there is also the same effect what i mean with microscopic and also making it abstracted you come together only using a symbol of an arrow and that's all the information we need and then everybody has the thing to do with that because it's meaningful it's so meaningful that it becomes meaningless so you you and that's a bit the thing with with also with chaos with making things in stable you just create a space where people can find the freedom but at the same time it is very clear what needs to happen you have one arrow yeah that's it um yeah i like that because like in in your framework we use this idea of like it's whatever you know but it's a whatever that is uh recognizable do you have is is that whatever it is somewhat is still uh within the realm of what is possible i make this analogy from what you were saying that is still uh there is something very specific within this chaos but i think also i want to [Music] uh and maybe i just jump in a bit uh what i found very challenging with like especially with network performance is that like it can be whatever but also uh there are like fundamental conditions that the internet has to work so in this case like if my house's internet uh shuts down then it's over and it's very different from like when you're in physical space then you can't have well not total control but you know you can't you you can expect what will happen but in this case of network performance it's unpredictable and that's why we said about the fail at the node uh festival that it was not that we did it poorly or it was not good it's just that the computers didn't work and uh we didn't stream it properly that we expected in a expected way and that's really difficult that we have to confront this kind of unpredictable uh error it's not even glitch like it's not just like i don't hear you well but it's just completely the silence and then how would you deal with that as a dancer or artist if that happens as if you promised to have a streaming as a performance but from my experience also working with with contact it's it's it's a huge challenge to bring the technology and the dance together from like from a from a temporal point of view like from what is the tempo that you're working how do you work uh what is the space that you need to work so what we are testing now is just to be in a studio together we say okay we take even very limited time we work in blocks of one hour and we just work simultaneously and and even just to be in the same space at the same time to work already creates an environment where we will have an influence on each other what we do and there is moments where we go for simultaneity and there is a moment where we go for preparation or we say okay how many it's something that we learned also and it's really bad now but it's to say okay how much time do you need okay this amount of time okay how much time you need to check it we [Music] temple but also a media if a graphic designer has to sketch i have to be very physical in this space and content has to be really inside how do you work simultaneously but simultaneously at the same time being aware that there is other people at the space there is also an aspect of sound which can be disturbing and that's also where the failure that i connected that we created environment and disturbance is actually one of the the main school in that environment yeah but i'm always thinking that i found when we tried to work this towards have this experience when so interdisciplinarity or transdisciplinarity which are our terms that nowadays are very uh uh are very more out these days and it is so so so true that when people come together um the approach somehow because of capital uh just the constraints of a society that we live it's functional so for instance like in the in the framework then that was something that we proposed like the framework we said that it's a queer form of conversation between technology and bodies and we said that it's queer because it tries as much as possible to not take a side so it's not dance because it's not dance but it's also not video so it's everything that is in between these two basic spaces and it's tried to not be functional in the sense that it's not dense that it hires the services of technology to enhance the dance but it's also not doing the opposite and and i think that's a tricky thing how because we're working with technological means you know unless uh yeah it's binary the nature of these things are binary so how to keep the fluid maybe like trying to bring the how to keep fluids these frameworks i mean first of all i think for i don't necessarily okay that is binary is really almost technical i'd like to see it more as is in the middle but it's it's numeric so you just need numbers that's what we need in the end but how can numbers express uh experiences that's one of the big struggles that we have now so then you come very close to where you are a hybrid between science and dance where we work with sensors where we were now contacting people again like the arrow an information which is so refined or so abstract that we can change it whomever which is just a number and the number we can share with tomato and it gives the freedom to the people but at the same time it will always symbolize something that comes from me if i have this experience and that's for me is number six or it is in the scale okay when you say okay if my heart is between this and this and then you have a threshold there and it goes beyond it it means they're going to be able to content for example for the sounds so containers need to know what is my experience you just need to get the signal and i think that's also for me i find it more interesting because i i don't think we will it's very interesting to share our experiences verbally or what we do that's really interesting but we will never be able to do that so i don't see i don't i don't see why keep digging in that kit if you can say oh if you can just accept it and say like okay we can talk about it but let's just give it a number and i give it to you and in the end is not about us but it's about the whole uh result the performance the sound the space the reaction the chain reaction of how this has been mediated and creating a new output because we're not doing science there i find interesting because i don't work with other people in this sense i do work with other people but not the psychology people but i have a person with or like templates is to to have uh in this sense an amateur another studied vision on it and to see how can i become a creator with things that are actually again they are like the templates or the programs are made for a certain kind of use and then i just become a user and how can i go away from just being how can i create a space that accidents can happen or failure of the program like this video programs also sounds there's sometimes like i don't know like you do something and the future of course does it correctly but you you have any other outcome that you expected and to work is to really create a space in my practice that accidents can happen and also they're not understanding the programs completely i never i never i never learned something from from 0 to i 200. work out of deductives or learn out of that so i always have some glimpse of understanding of how it works but then also like programming a little bit how can i go into a code just shift this a little bit and then it comes something out that i don't really understand in a very deep sense of understanding what i'm actually doing and or why it's reacting exactly like then to see it happens this [Music] [Music] work that with another person because i i don't have so much experience to because i think it's working along with it's completely different i i have always mine that is kind of yeah but i think we should we could be closing uh this is 28 minutes it's there around 30 minutes yes yes i think the discussion is around science [Music] let's not forget that science also goes this way it was an accident but a lot of progress came from accidents and things technologies that were used in the way that they wanted me so i wanted to stress this just to yeah i mean specifically the yeah we just have an exposition the opening of an exposition of a collective of what if you have to go back let me just keep talking here for a little bit uh for those who want to say so that we have uh the opening for an expo art and science collective i'm a part of uh which stands for space technologies art and design and um it was like the first time that we we sent uh art state artwork to space sometimes so is this the framework is very uh and ideal what i'm trying to show here is that in the opening i could see like the struggle of putting this uh putting the program together because in science normally then you will have this approach there is very production but i think it's called naturalism that is about reducing everything until you you get to uh a point is uh yeah that everything like a phd goes always enough you when you do a phd is something that is very uh specific so while and i found something that is very interesting at the same time that is happening and it's been listening at this point is about this idea of complexity science which is an entanglement of not only naturalism but uh understanding chaos and that has to be a lot with randomness and what the powers of computers bring so there is specifically with the computers but it's interesting and it's related with chaos theory is that scientists cannot understand how a process goes but they uh on an artificial intelligence framework but they know they get to some point which is the same case quantum quantum physics so science cannot understand the process but they know there is something that will come at the outcome and this is something that is problematic for the naturalist like to not understand this process because as a normal the path that we haven't followed so far these days and now because we have the the computers have this power these things are being introduced like to be more open in these questions like why not could be also a signs that involve different fields but i think that but i think reality is very complex you know to make everybody happy like in the in the opening it was like it was clear it was very very difficult because the framework was for families but it is artwork and it's about like something that went into space to the international space station and then so it's a bit difficult to make it performative like that everybody's happy within that framework you have families but also that you can also express something that is uh using bioinformatics data visualization and also maybe abstraction in terms of just art um it was very complicated and i think it's something that it's not or i haven't yeah so far i think it's not going to change because there are different uh realities of uh it's a it's a complicated marriage this idea of uh so i don't know if somebody else has some of uh like we want to say something then we can just uh so thank you very much for sharing space and then i invite you guys to go outside and then you can get some music and then we go okay thank you very much thank you so much [Music]", "YVsbA73NEV8": "so hello peeps i screwed up my rehearsal rehearsal for tomorrow deck found the dance yes please chat best practices in contemporary dance and diva dance in brussels at class studio now we're gonna be at class studio it's the first time presenting in brussels right so i presented within my studies uh multimedia communication technology uh from which i just finished with my internship at motionbank from which i just sent finally an email that it took me like two days to write oh my god it takes me so long to grind just to write this like i love like you know i like this collaboration because i so difficult for me just to say like hello how are you can you check this thank you you know basically this is what i was saying in different words anyway and so i think now it is very good in doing this practical writing oh my god jack jack oh my god okay let's go practical but jack if you're seeing this i hope it's just this thing with the emails but just so short uh version of this thing is that we are presenting this that we're going to present tomorrow at the taco dance in path performing art forum within the framework of uh puff summer university um and then they we put we propose a text and then they come back to us like do you would you mind to send a 300 words version of this text and then so yeah the program so now to took care of this and he just sent it back and then he just reply with this like a a ps by the way if you want you can use more than 300 words seriously oh now you should send your thesis and you know without without anything without a hello or anything just like copy paste like and i say like just more than 300 words pdf ah you know actually i think it'll be just even funny and then they decide what to do with that i think we will be fine in whatever they decide from within that yeah that could be interesting anyway so let's not try to deviate from here so we are here rehearsing right we have a theme to talk about um or not i don't know like i said i propose to know to like let's try to talk around some topics so one of the topics that i propose also because which is opening this up exposition with seeds is uh arts and science that's one topic and maybe uh other topic i guess could be we talk about practices what is this that we do and i think from there we can just go on yeah good okay so what is this now right it's funny that every time we talk about this title like everyone's like you know like confused especially dance people but actually it's only dance people i think i never like had this kind of you know confrontation with other people from other fields at the impulse dance was the mac was the topic yeah class i remember like but class was nice because i remember he said to us like it's so good that you use the hashtag without the hashtag it will be [Laughter] so since then but actually since then so i always like i have this on mine you know the hashtag and because now it's slowly like at the beginning i try to put it just everything in lowercase as a long thing as a teaser to force people to look at that but then after so now i'm more like putting like the capital best practices in contemporary dance right we think a long sentence but then also i'm i always i think i put of course the hashtag since class said that i am very conscious of that so for instance in the application that we passed for the vj contest for this thing in rome there was no possibility of that because of the format of the field the hashtmail field i couldn't put the hashtag because it was not valid so then then i thought then i was feeling already let go no no no no this is too strong wow that's funny they don't allow it yeah yeah i don't know why anyway so how would you define practice yeah i mean i think i'm better at like maybe speaking about the history of the best practices let's say yeah because it's like we started like meeting online like two years okay so waste so okay so maybe i will say like so best practices is a queer form of conversation between technology and bodies yeah and then i think now to kenny i think just maybe do a summarize how this happened where are we so everyone knows that two years ago we had a beginning of pandemic and i propose to meet online and have a have a online meetup just to talk about what was it dance and technology i think that's kind of the thing no no it wasn't no you put it as a digital performance i think it could be it wasn't it it was it was online performances that's the way that online performances that's funny because then i had already in mind that i wanted to do something specific with online performances anyways um because that's something i thought you know we have to talk about it it's not like you know we can just come up with something and we just produce something but we need to start conversation open up the conversation first which is kind of the how we started this chat so that we have this practice like two pillars one is the practice that we do as a practice but not performance and the other thing is the chat which is what we are having right now i recommend kind of started with a chat like we meet met like like every week or so and weekend was every week at the beginning was every week yeah and then after three months i think april may june uh on july 8th if i remember correct correctly 20 wait 20 20 right yeah 20 20. we had this first practice that basically like we started to talk about like it was before puff it was after path um that's a good question actually i don't know i think we started before i think we started before but i think that the difference is like at the beginning so we start in between like we try to practice i mean it was not called a practice we just started like within your framework and that it was proposed i mean i i read it through the choreography coding lab the there is this framework uh proposed by motionbank on dancing technology um and then in the facebook there was a there was an event so that you share on this online performances and then so i joined and then weekly then so at the at the beginning it was open right and it was not called anything it was just it was uh your call out to let's meet up every saturday it was during the pandemic and it's performed online basically and then during that period that i think it was a meeting of two hours then basically i think we share uh tools uh and i think most i think you share a lot of uh of your tools that your brother you were working with right and studio or like different things you know like i like a lot of different things that already you were working with and so then at some point afterwards after doing this they was in between performing getting talking a lot about hard work criticizing the the the field talking a lot about motion bank uh at some point we thought like i i am and in between them performing somehow everything was happening at the same time so at some point we thought like wait and it was open no we have a ghost guests and things like that right yeah we announced it on that well kind of public group on facebook so sometimes we have a guest we just it's like really random and sometimes jorge was not there and i was talking to someone else um but then at one point we decided to do more like a focused session between two of us and at some point and so i think so then we started just practicing and then we didn't know and we didn't call that what was called nothing i mean we didn't call it anything we called it the best practices from the beginning from the ah really okay yeah yeah and if i remember so like in one hand this comes from at that time i was studying doing the last subject of development in my school and we were i was studying and i was studying for an exam about best practices in coding so you have different types of code the way structures of code that you apply depending of the problem that you have to solve and those are called best practices [Music] and then they so then we just were talking because the conversation was intentional how how funny it will be to talk about best practices in contemporary dance yeah because if you look at like software development or like even like business management and stuff you can always find you know like 10 best practices and blah blah and you know have this web web page talk about this but you never find best practices in contemporary dance i mean maybe some kind of dance yes but uh contemporary dance what we're talking about is very different from like having this kind of best practices but i i think it's interesting because always when people ask about this name so i know this take because it was proposed like somehow as a joke i think from me but then at some point then like there is a text that you wrote about this i don't know exactly what it is right now online but i think it will be interesting to find it and to share this because you summarize this that it doesn't not only i mean it it reflects uh about the best practices um yeah there is a text about this i don't know if you can find it maybe like something like uh to find like this search for best practices is kind of best practices for us so it's not like that we reach to the best practices but the best practices kind of theorize and try to find the best practices is through practicing practices yeah yeah so like the best practice is like practicing basically exactly practicing yeah so referential or like recursive definition uh but i will find this text today like where is it because we are using this in the application that we are using these days so but anyway um yeah so we started like this and then then what we do in a practice then yeah so what do we do in a practice it's like just like a zoom call but we use this tool called light lab which fortunately came like became public around the time we started in practice and because at the beginning at the beginning we were not using that no we were on gtc at some point up here and then we say oh okay let's just do this and then yeah yeah it's just another video call but what's good about it is you can share as many like cameras windows like desktop windows like screen share as much as you want so like if it's just two of us whether you end up with like a grid of different angles of cameras and screens and stuff and also you can make it pop out as another window so it's easy to load it together in in other softwares another software yeah yeah and manipulate the image yeah and so yeah so what we're doing i think like the beginning was straightforward just like basically i create a composition with a pdmx between with bdmx a bj software and then hydra i compose something using a green key and then i send that composition to an auto now to will use his tools and then he will recompose that image using my my my fit image and he will send back this image to me and then we will repeat the process over and over and and at some point then the bodies will get in rectangle and just that the configuration of the body uh delay glitch was there all the time but that's like at first it was more like a experiment we said that's like what's what we said was like the starting time and then we finish after one hour so we start at 8 00 pm and then we finish at 9 pm and there is no extension because at some point also we were discussing so we were not uh i think that became more clear afterwards but at the beginning we were not like uh proposing subjects or something to work on it more than just like we're gonna practice for one hour starting at this point and finishing at this point uh at some point naturally happens that we knew that one thing that we knew is right before the end of the practice then we're just gonna dance like we're gonna just like really go for dancing yeah but beforehand we didn't uh predefine which tools to use the content or so on and i think at some point afterwards i think that was more in their uh hybrid uh presidents that we did at puff while i was working on my thesis that we work we tried to work on some topics i think maybe one or two times uh that was around february 2021 yeah yeah and then then we would try this within this format of developing we have the developing practice and chat then yeah it's like a one day kind of virtual residency format in the morning we check in develop something and then afterwards we have like two hours right in that time and then sometimes we change it like sometimes we say one hour two hours yeah yeah and then after that we had the chat in the end yeah but then we try like sometimes like let's do it right after but since the we said like let's do it as a directional performance so it was non-stop streaming for six hours seven hours so then when we finish it's something was really heavy and then i think we then said like okay let's just chat afterwards because it was very heavy and we had like a few times guests at the chat to have like different inputs from people right and i think something that i think i i recall that is interesting to mention here for people to know in this process is like so we start as just practicing and at some point jan uh who is her name last name jana jan fox from yeah she invited now to to co-create to create to organize these uh online platform using mozilla hubs uh where now to propose the choreography coding lab online version and then he created a program and then within that program then we said okay let's gonna do let's do a practice and then actually was the first time then we met in person after bankruptcy after a few months of being working like half a year almost yeah because that was since end of september 2020. so we're sharing the apartment and we spent like a week uh um but the climax was this practice together in the same place that we had this green screen like a panel and on between the two of us yeah on two sides we were having laptops so that we don't we share the same space but we don't see each other and we try to frame it as a kind of um performance in a way then we didn't knew like what uh what was the intention with it and then we had even like a safe design yes we were both stage design and then basically we were aiming to propose something good we were working and we have this pressure of presenting at node uh which is uh an important festival of media art and arts in in germany so we thought like okay it has to be something good right and then even rehearsed and then the rehearsal was quite good right i mean i felt the rehearsal i know aesthetically or functional was good but then when we performed i remember things were not working and right after we finished we felt like oh my god like somebody asked us like when we went downstream how did it went and then we were like we totally failed yeah right and that thing was what it changed everything because from that moment so it was at the beginning like you know we were feeling like as a it was like as a down feeling of how we failed but after just few minutes after just reflecting is like wait wait a moment so we totally failed all right so we don't have to actually aim for doing something good let's just practicing because this is totally uh it just it just bypasses completely the idea that we have to perform and doing something good and then from there that we knew that because actually so i think what we were trying to do to note is to perform yeah i think we were trying to create a performance a good performance online performance we failed since we failed and we thought like okay we don't have to work towards a performance we just have to keep on practicing right yeah it's like performance well yeah like i think it could be a performance but we have to do a performance within the frame of practice so we after that it's not that we stopped uh kind of performing but we had some uh like a path you were doing uh were there in february and march i think you also like shared it at path and also at improv stance last summer we did the i don't know how we framed it hybrid performance was it no no no no so that was also i think what is interesting from this framework is that because we bypass the politics of doing or by this failure in node so then what it happens is like we got this invitation to perform not to perform basically to share the framework in the in at the impulse dance so what we thought is like the easiest way to talk about this that is so entertaining that and so that at the core is just a language the naoto and myself which is developed by practicing a lot um then we thought this is where it's just like okay what we're gonna do is just like practice basically practice with audience in the same space it was the first time and and then because we did that in that way so we propose we're gonna practice but we have an audience and then we said like after we practice we can do a small chat with audience where we would like to hear questions and options right right and then after we finish that so it happens in a similar way with note that is after we finish we thought wait a second what we just did right now it was a performance you know with audience it was a hybrid thing because also it was online so we thought this is actually is the starting point from what we call a hybrid performance now yeah i see and that was the something we tried at half when we both were there in september i think september yeah 2021 yeah um and i think that's in short is this the history of the practices um in between like i mean there are so many things now like the there's so many different frameworks uh so after also we were invited to us to speak uh in a conference i guess uh i knew now uh we were invited speakers where we proposed the chat so in this case we didn't propose the practice format but we proposed the chat format of the best practices i don't understand on the stage so like in a classical conference where before of us where people like using these lights and you know uh and and after us also well what we propose and we i remember we discussed how to approach that without though we said like okay i remember saying to an auto i don't want to have to uh prove my uh presence here by starting who i am you know showing my credential basically and showing who are us like yeah through these credentials but then rather than that we thought it might be interesting just actually to take the chat in that format of a conference as a performative moment where we just share the fragility and vulnerability uh of not knowing actually uh on stage with people right yeah that was like something i don't know if that was that new now but i started to like think more about like vulnerability basically when i present something yeah that uh yeah yeah and that also connects for me to about this kind of idea of safe space that you know i'm sharing something that might make myself vulnerable but that's yeah that's what it is that's that's the sharing process right um so here we are testing our installation there's gonna be tomorrow's share uh the data for the dance the class and collab reach and collapse studio and audrey in brussels is an ongoing installation of basically a playlist random offer practices that at the moment is around 200 hours of content imagine that yeah and actually so imagine like so it's like 200 hours of content uh and you know what i don't know if you realize but we are in the practice 99 so we haven't reached a hundred yes so we have to do something special for the practice hundreds those are 99 videos beat 99 videos on the playlist of the of the practices that's easy because we have like usually two videos for one practice yeah yeah yeah yeah that's that's something to yeah celebrate yeah we are about to go to the number 100 of uh practice yeah yeah yeah yeah wow so that's pretty cool so maybe we can just like jump into other topic i don't know how we jump to our start feel like really yeah i mean we can go continue with you know what this practice is but uh it also feels like uh starting to get like kind of bored not bored but it's different uh flow from usual chat yeah right like yeah because so what we were trying to do here in some houses like give ground for those who have no idea of the framework to in a way have a basic reference of the timeline of from where this comes from and in a nutshell what is this so i guess in a nutshell this is about uh net art life coding contemporary dance hybrid formats and actually i guess in a more philosophical way like emergence and and basically uh yeah practicing resilience uh practicing vulnerability uh and not knowing uh yeah practice practices to be okay with not knowing it's very like on one hand it's so kind of conceptual but also like it comes from the doing by doing it's really hands-on so that's why i have tons of videos that's again it's not like about producing a performance but it can't happen to be a performance but it's a by by definition it's a practice one yeah so yeah let's talk about art and science it's so hard where's the science part now yeah i guess like in our case straightforward it's computed science and i think like more in complexity science in a nutshell uh complexity science and emergency that's this is a topic that for me is new so i'm starting getting also more involved in understanding what does this mean actually so i wouldn't speak more too much about it more than what i have found so far but like going back more to uh [Music] art and science because i i guess like in the way i see it like this that we do we think this terminology is like dance and technology art and technology and then arts and science uh in that order of umbrella opening the scope so yesterday so i'm part of a collective called seeds which stands for space ecologies art and design and yesterday we have the opening of an expo uh where from which we present our first artwork that went into the space called engines of eternity and it was done in pilar not far away from what i live and it was very interesting also uh to see how the event was first organized like created and also to see how it was the response of people um because so it was an event where i think i think together with seats are like five artists are invited we're invited by karim something i don't remember her last name she's a professor of uh bio biological evolution and kai leuven and she was the entry point and she was the person who invited sids to participate uh on this project from which roti rotifers which are small tiny animals female animals which are a sensation and are shocking in the sense that they are females that clone itself so meaning that they don't need males to reproduce and so they are and they are super resilient in the in the way that they can resist incredible temperatures and ionic uh exposure and radiation and so on so they are these like uh very special creatures that don't need males to reproduce so the experiment of her is was to basically send this uh rotifers to space and then do some biological experiments in the space and then bring them back and then comparing those rotifers who went to space with those who stays in earth and then some do some thing then the work of seeds was to do something narrative artwork within this framework [Music] so what i think i'm bringing this topic here is not too much about what is this project about it but it's like to think about how fragile and how complex is this topic of trying to merge arts and science um because it's not an easy is not an easy match um i say i say as i put it in my context in my context and the one that i have experience on and i have been researching for five years now is on designing on design and art that's my context the one that i know the best and i know it's a very difficult topic to put together um so going back to art and science i think is uh is is quite difficult uh in one hand because naturalist in science uh which are very based on facts and proofs they are it's very hard for them to understand why uh how the art can influence and how the art works within this context basically people who are trained as a naturalist scientist [Music] and on the other hand like you have this expo for instance where uh i think the the umbrella was like to present the work that it was aimed for uh general public right so in a way i guess was through earth uh exposing science in a familiar way in way of families to communicate what science is yeah what they are working on yeah like through i think yes as an art as a medium how signs uh on yeah science and art can be a match basically and so it was like the warehouse the curatorial process happened i think it was like that so the selected artworks i think they tried to reflect that but then in reality what it happens is that i have this conversation with different people is like it's so scattered the way they decide to put the program so you enter and then you have a forest of installations crazy artifacts made by an artist that i don't remember his name but his main goal is like during the process where the installation is going to happen uh families are invited and public in general to basically come together with the artists together and then just start creating and affecting these artifacts and creating art pieces together so there is colors there is a different material that kids and families can use together and then create things and then put it together as in the way to creating art installations but then when you go upstairs uh the second floor then one of the so then then one of the works that is exposed and maybe i might there to say it was the highlight of the of the expo is then is the project of seeds [Music] which is actually the only project if i'm not wrong for not mistaking it was the only of the artists that actually uses the that actually that and consciously send something to the space and then once it came back uh basically angelo sent his fingerprints on some on the backs on some backs where the rotifers were so angelus and his fingers spring to space and then when those fingerprints came back uh together with the data uh the print is transposed into a 2d image and then using this data to through a generative process create an rps that became a 3d sculpture and also some prints so i think what i'm trying to say here is that situation this is a great work in terms of bioinformatics so which is very close to science in the way how all this complex information was placed and so in terms of graphic design and information design was very well done [Music] so then you see this that is quite complex it's a very complex thing with nice imaginary with code and things like that and then you have next to it at three pieces uh that it can be completely appreciated as an apart thing what i think uh they were just like in a classical sense like some three abstract paintings they were just actually the fingerprints of angelo so what it actually originates the whole ex expo uh so they were just like a big uh print metal print on metal uh the 3x putting next to each other uh which i think that summarized the whole project for me like the rest of thing and i think it's here what i'm struggling trying to share is like there's a big difference between these three art pieces that they summarize everything and also they're very performative in terms of like these three things they are wonderful also as classical art they are just so well done and they're so abstract and also they have so much history stories behind the way how they were conceived and everything is just as by chance as our framework so it just really represents for me something that is uh artistically cohesive and interesting because also you don't need to know all the needy things about science and all these complex things uh that in the other place the one with bioinformatics the prints the data visualizations the 3d prints and the other one is very difficult for people to understand what actually does it means these graphics um so i think it's a quite a drastic drastic separation between these simple abstractions and this uh approach to generative art yeah that's something like i also kind of being more conscious about when i let's say produce something it's not just like the concept behind it but of course it has to look interesting like that's it's always like good if it's it has some kind of this catchiness into the artwork that even if people don't understand what's behind it if they can you know if they think it's pretty or like even like ugly there already is a like something good if it's something that is uninteresting as like visually uninteresting then you lose a lot of uh potential funders or audience right so that's really like a more strategy or maybe like a design process right that's that's something i really yeah that what i hear from the the seeds work i think it's really uh smart yeah but it's like is this uh so we have this friend of us like uli she was one of the person who was part of this chat right she's an astrophysicist and she's very interested and in a doing a scientific approach so doing a research actually that is funded by a side from a scientific point of view of actually measuring and trying to uh prove trying to see if actually the artistic thinking can bring something into uh science and she struggles a lot with uh this because um so yeah she's in the business of basically proving things right um while i don't know how we will call what what are the business that we are if we is in the business of proving things how would you frame the will be our business yeah i mean before going that like i always feel like why always art and science is like uh kind of bad marriage is because like in short it's not always true but uh like you said science is about like starting the question or hypothesis and then you have to find the like why it happens like a theory a result whatever that it's more like narrowing down from the question but art is always the other way around that you start with something even like so trivial but you end up with 100 questions with it about it right so yeah straightforward like the the naturalistic approach in science is reductionism as you said you know you start for something and you go close you narrow down when you do your phds are really narrow into one question and you try to use your uh methodology in order to to prove uh if that was wrong or right or where this goes after while in in art i would agree yes like you will be more just you if you i think you're not trying to prove something like in that sense i think that's close this but i think that i think that's maybe that's interesting because i think like i think art and science are in different in in the different domains as we said and i think maybe the place or the the place in between there has been is there is being discussed nowadays with technology is engineering i think engineering is in somehow the cross point where these two in a way i think they can do something um because of the pragmatic house approach which is very convenient for science yeah it could be because engineering is not about like finding why something happens but it's just about making stuff happen like if you want if this room is too hot then you know it doesn't matter like what's emitting the heat or what's i mean maybe you want to know about the insulation and stuff but uh in the end you know you need to have a system that cools down and if it works then you don't have to know what why it works right yeah and then this room is getting hot and then going back to this question that i was saying like if the business of uh of science is about like proving things um then i think uh i like to think uh personally also and i think this is the way how i see this framework best practices with nauto is about not about is not concerning about creating something but rather about creating the conditions for something to happen and in that sense i think i refer to what you're saying with engineering i found that's interesting because not totally that but it's somehow it is uh within also it is it is part of the domain because we didn't like start with all these questions like when we started like practicing like we have all these kind of questions we came up with like this self-dissociation or this sandbox uh but then that's not something we asked like that's not the like the reason why we started practice we just started as like you know for fun for example it's like it was more like a curiosity but then it was not about you know how would the net performance influence ourselves but then it came naturally to us after doing it for a few months right right right yeah it's true it's true like we never really started like thinking okay let's investigate what is net art and then after let's go and practice yeah we didn't even think about that art until like you know at some point we started talking about it i think i think we started really talking about concepts when i was writing my thesis because then i have to write basically and that was a good excuse to really go into concepts because it was and i think that's interesting i i really appreciate that that i went through that path of design because it forces me to putting down into all these concepts uh that i understand that we understand and we build through the chat uh and then narrowing all this thing down in a communicable manner in so softening the discourse into something that will be more accessible for other people and trying as much as possible if not impossible to make it less self-referential yeah yeah true and it's yeah as you said it's about communication because it's like we know that what we're doing is valid and it's something new but we can't just say it's something new i mean we say that but also like we have to refer to uh what is happening what people are doing even though if like even though we're not you know directly like referencing them or like taking inspiration like for example namjoon pick like we talked about it but it's not that we're trying to you know make something like what he does or i mean at some point we maybe did it a bit more explicitly but it's um yeah it's not like we're kind of branching out from something else but it's just like started something new and then then we have to see the correlation to what has been happening or what others are doing yeah and i think that's i think that's at the core of what we're trying to do actually here i mean in sense of like creating community and that is kind of like uh i like to think of this uh so we submit this application for butch how bout like to develop this uh one like to develop the hybrid performance but a second i think this is more key and i think this is very interesting like how uh the big i mean like the from 2020 until 2022 we basically have developed a framework where naoto myself can find trying to find ourselves in we think that and then we just basically we just share it online as to uh try to incentivize or to motivate discussion about these topics um but then then we're thinking that from 2022 uh i'm moving forward if we have some funding will be interesting to actually trying to worse towards some i don't like to even work that i don't even like completely the word community but in in order to make this simple i think i will use it here as in order to so in order to uh so that we would like to build somehow a community so not a sect of best practices practitioners uh but more like a space where people can basically can uh express themselves within this uh within dance and technology i think right yeah it's something yeah i don't know what's what's the right word uh besides community uh because it's something that is more like community feels like something not exclusive but you have you know explicitly like you're the community member and you're not yeah yeah i think something that people can be common yeah because i think yeah i think it does record like i was and i was having this conversation with duly again and that's one one of the topics that i that i argue in my paper is that there is uh the communities are are these great frameworks where people have conditions and you know like because then sometimes they they are supported so there are places where uh conditions are there uh but at the same time communities are ready also to be one-sided in the sense of like if you are part of the uh hip-hop community you should in a way like field yourself in terms of identity you know in terms of individualism you should be aligned within uh more or less concrete uh sort of uh values i guess and political views and and on one so on um which i think uh i don't see it so practical uh when you want to try to develop your individuality as an artist um so i mean that specifically is with community uh like for instance like with seeds we have this conversation like like because we are really trying to redefine our mission and vision uh so and then we go into these topics and trying to grind together then okay uh is this a so for them it's about community but then i just start bringing this again that perhaps that i just don't like the word community because implied that you have to in a way be uh pro uh gay rights or lgb community uh rights or not uh part of this community so you that it demands for you to take a position right basically um and i rather so i think a good analogy and this comes from i think it's martin at some point martin spamber said this at some point that he put the analogy of uh he put the verses between uh um meetings and gatherings so like these meetings are close to this idea of community which has conditions and you know that happens every certain time you know the space you know the regular subs suspects and so on um but uh gathering on the other hand on the other hand you have gatherings which gatherings are just spontaneously and they just happen at some point and they just dissolve at some point as it happens to my home and have beer oh i see it happens also what happens also with rave parties you know like these illegal rift parties they just all of them just all the sorting is like do you have some projector do you have some some system send it in the network in less than six hours everybody's just parting full on after 12 hours during that period you make great connections you feel life of the the fullest after 12 hours everybody's going back home there is no strings attached there is no compromise for this to happen in eight days maybe it will happen but maybe will not there is not a compromise to meet again but the same people and with the same people exactly so it doesn't demand for you as a member i mean because this idea of member it doesn't exist in there right you are not a member of a gathering right you are more a participant i guess yeah i would say like maybe we cut here and tomorrow we talk about the community because interesting topic like not just like what community is what we're talking about right now but like interesting yeah how do we you know connect to the people basically yeah that would be interesting because then we will have people like and i would like to know how people will feel about it actually how does that work and actually this will be perfect in this idea because with class with we start thinking and we create this facebook group of dance and tech belgium which has currently seven participants oh yeah so if you one if you are in belgium or if you maybe it doesn't matter if you are not in belgium but you want to be part of danson tech belgium join and um yeah so i guess the link would be somewhere and then yeah so they would would be interesting then to talk about this idea of like community what does this mean actually yeah great so thank you so much good idea that if i have a screen that shows the playlist as well i mean i don't know how you your setup will be but at least for me i think it's good then i don't have to show the showreel and stuff yeah yeah yeah like uh i mean it will it will be just i mean i'm going tonight today to to see how i set up the installation but it will be just somewhere projecting uh this that we see here somewhere um so we'll see so i guess hopefully also maybe we have to manage because of the cable seems there is no so lumet you know all these things that we don't have to discuss here so maybe we can just close the chat here and then we go to backstage and then we talk about this technical nightmare yeah thanks for watching right uh please subscribe it reached 100 no 500 subscribers and i'm really happy oh wow yes all right ciao", "B1ee0Qbw8_Y": "hey hey how are you i'm good the weather is good so i'm in my terrace yeah you're like um looks like you look like a frame of a movie i'm in the movie yeah i have these glasses and the the filter is is kind of you know like movie oh nice nice nice absolutely so uh the reason why we're here is i just wanted to talk about the the video i showed you uh jorge the watch video which one was it uh from the last uh open house last week when we did this uh recording with uh lights and stuff and i i remember you told me about some ideas but uh yeah yeah yeah is it possible to watch it again here i don't know if it's possible because i don't think i have to we should be able to share the screen huh yeah it's more about if i have the video or not i think i have already youtube yeah yeah that's true no i mean not the audio because we weren't yeah the video doesn't have uh yeah call you from the neighbors let's see it's a bit long so probably i'll just skip through let me see what i can do or maybe like i can just like play it and we can talk about it screen okay like um best practices reacts to so i hope it's working yeah your seams yeah okay and yeah maybe i can just skip through a little bit let's see here or maybe the second part of the video was more interesting yeah this one yeah i mean i think like the first part we just tried to modify a bit of visuals but maybe in the second part we start moving a bit more [Music] i think it's just i think it's just different i don't think it's more let's say i wouldn't say this is less interesting because uh it's just different like the second part it has texture the first part is very flat but i find it also that you put this simple patterns uh you see like in the like if you go back can you go back to where you were yeah this before or i don't know like at some point you were just you you were also projecting some simple uh oscillator also so that's what i mean that uh it seems this to me like um like if you if you maybe like illustrator you know when you put layers on top of each other and in a way they're kind of they're they're harsh like they're not uh that they are not uh blurring or fading between each other which it happens in the second part and what you show me yeah yeah but the first part i found also interesting because i mean it's just completely different but yeah yeah we have a a word we say like in visual but i just can't think about spanish word which is uh yeah your association yes yeah um but this also i mean we i remember we started to do more black and white also because we have like this uh screen that this like uh transparent screen that uh with color it's like i mean i i don't like very much how it looks like with color but i think it's interesting when you start like uh doing like a different kind of uh layers but not layers on the on higher layers of what is on the front and then you start having more things on at the back like physically yeah exactly this part right yeah yeah yeah also like i think i noticed that and uh moved the one of the dmx lights so that it directly shoots to the you know the little screen in on the left i don't know if it's clear but no so right now it's like going like reddish color to blue the the one that is like behind my head behind your head okay like close just like the center like a bit left from the center that square screen yeah does that does it dmx like yeah so it has a little bit of projection but i move the dmx light to the side so it's like it's like a side light and it doesn't cast light on the transparent screen but it goes like more or less directly to that uh square screen so it has different color from the projection so you mean like the projection and make uh some light um from the dmx light yeah but dmx light doesn't go to the transparent screen not so much yeah this part is really has really a lot of depth i mean it always is the question like you know like it's like what do you guys want to do with that you know because that's what i mean that's what i meant with uh things like if you if you compromise yourself with with i mean if you said i want to create a performance um so if you want to compose then in that regards and i think oh okay so you have somehow like some um atmosphere in the first scene you know like that what i call kind of illustrator or these harsh layers in top of each other and now i see this is a completely different scene or another ingredient of your soup but this is more like uh i will set one um this is more like a dramatic part of the of the performance somehow you know like here you get all the full attention you know like if you think if what i'm trying to do is an analogy with a performance then you can imagine like this is the place where this is the time where the people cannot uh yeah this is like the dramatic part of or something that it has a lot of depth yeah but but again then the first part is very different so you might you might need in terms of composition to differentiate these parts if what you're working is still working towards composition i see and then we started putting some well flora started putting some paper yeah because i'm not convinced with that screen yeah yeah yeah this yeah this reminds me when i went out on myself we were trying to when we were trying to work with the tv and then it's not working and yeah it's just it's very similar the structures whole but i mean that's why i yeah i think going into composition is just uh i think should not be the thing i think it's just very complicated issue um um rather just because it's just naturally this is just not working somehow as you want it somehow at that moment therefore you have something to do and so and then it's organic so it's not so if then it will be constantly uh adjusting but never arriving and i think that's that's i think somehow if we go back i think some like principles of like on the way who i think now out to myself like we construct things uh and i and i'm interested in that in that path uh is in instability and not trying to arrive [Music] but also you have to be sensible enough because sometimes you want to it's a tricky thing like because you you still need to if you follow your ego you will try to i think both extremes that are not working if you go if you try to just not arrive and then just you keep them as they will be the same with movement if i will just start keep on moving and moving i think that's the thing that's a kind of a difference i will contradict myself but try to be open to what i'm saying in movement in dance let's say then you will have the you can move and i think that will make a difference between somebody who is professional somehow or has like knowledge about body knowledge and somebody who doesn't is that the one who does know it will have more conscious uh elements from which the person can stay longer and try to improvise a thing while so then you as an audience can catch nuances within the movement while the other person might just get into the flow without knowing what is going on so it's just a catharsis that allowed the the movement to to pass and there is nothing wrong with one or the other one but the two approaches are quite different um and it and again i think if you go either as a as a very technical even if yeah but if you go in in that regard more like this professional uh dancer approach or this empirical dancer approach then it's just flattening the whole thing in both spectrums the the question is and the difficult part is how to try to get in the middle how how how can let's say for instance how can if i know about dance because i went to school how can i somehow fake that i don't know and try to allow me to still have this uh beauty and this naiveness and this all these beautiful things that comes from not knowing about dancing that's some things for instance that i told now to constantly and now to confront me very much in the stage and and when i show for instance these two other people always are in love with the auto and and the way how he moves because then i'm then and and i have shared with him this thing like for me it's very difficult to move because i lose it that's something that is a constant in my movement i'm trying to in a way negotiate and then i also i cannot just try to not know because that would be uh as the case of people who are doing careers in faking which is a concept in art i think also i share with with floor this concept when we were in the museum i think this idea of faking so there are people who go towards faking and it's a very complicated thing that you really go towards that direction or that um so rather so i i cannot just uh uh try to be an estate one of dance because i study that but nevertheless maybe since now is there or other people i will try using somehow to hijack my attention somehow and it's an impossible task because i will be constantly go back and criticize and trying to go to technique form and all these kind of things but uh it's just an invitation to try to find how can i get there because for me the difficult thing somehow is try to negotiate that side so the whole this long analogy is to say that i think and if what is interesting what you guys are doing is that because i see militarism in what we do now but in a senic as an icelandic proposal as that you i think you don't want to arrive but then uh but so this is this is like this is an open question and then all of us have here like because maybe so because maybe it's just enough what you guys are doing you know maybe it's not enough maybe you have to do more but that like we don't know like the only so you see what i mean is like nobody knows so who knows yeah i think this is something uh we were talking yesterday i mean i was talking with flor that uh from different perspective but we started to think that we are making some kind of objects like this modular stuff but they're not instruments so it's not like you master something like for example if there's like oscilloscope or some kind of display is lying on the floor but or like there's some motors that moves with the sensor but it's not like we're like kind of mastering them to like how to use them as an instrument how to use them in that scene but it's more about like it's like an invitation or it's like agency that's there and we can do whatever we want without or not to do with it but but maybe if i can interrupt there like to jump there like and i can bring back a bit bring a bit of my like what i do with joe for instance with this uh moody that is the thing that represents electronica the last time and i don't know if you saw it but it's just a wearable that it has a light here and i just changing the color depending of the mood of the people um so the pro i'm bringing this here because at some point we because we were working technically building this thing at some point we realized that one first for sure we didn't wanted to try to make it perfect and second it didn't so since we didn't to at some point we were in between like we do we need more money to actually really reach for these people who maybe get close to what we need and so then we find out like uh during this process like actually we don't want to reach we don't want to arrive there then it freed it it was clear to us that okay we are some how capable so we are we have so we we have technical knowledge so let's just use it to make it the best we can but we cannot make it perfect so and this actually that's the the core idea of faking is that if you don't know then you can try the best you can and then by itself gives give a core so for instance i don't know if some framework perhaps that now might know more than you and something with electronics so and then perhaps if you just you keep on going then it's completely fine because you cannot you're you're going to advance for sure and you're going to just go get better better like just without knowing so much and in that case it's just fine so that's i think that in that case i think perhaps that could be interesting because i think you want to keep the individuality within the things that you guys do that's kind of uh also like best practices right it's that it's also something that you cannot judge other people can't judge in that sense like because you master something that is going master or practice something that is not you know following how it should be yeah yeah so i can imagine for instance if somebody's going i don't know how what's your experience but if people go and i guess if they start asking you how does this work or how this like i can imagine that it's like because you know like i think it's very interesting like like it reminds me like if you i was uh trying to find out so interviews with gerald richter he was really good in that and also uh this guy with the light ah you know the guy with the light that kanye west the guy dreams yeah like these guys if you like they have no interviews because the interviews are like it just work you know like like is there flat uh and it's not because they're a part of them maybe they are or not they it's just like in richter for instance he said it was possible at that moment and that response to really to just being in the moment which i think is at the core what you guys want and i would like to also that's what i kind of i evoke and i try to work on that idea how to defend just by doing that is just fine to be actually not to do but to be yeah it's interesting because i think we've been like thinking about these uh how to be in the action maybe this is something that that we've been talking also we know with another friend but i think it makes sense with uh this concept of the spirit of the words no you read the words yeah you should use this a bit because i don't know about this well i think naoto can explain it better because it's uh maybe yeah i can try it from their culture yeah i mean it's a japanese word that we have which is literally spirit of a word uh we say it because like uh just to say you know think that if you say something good over and over it has a spirit and it can become true or if you say something bad then it might you know come back to you right get it yeah and i think it's related maybe not only to wars but probably with language i remember like the last time we could go to the netherlands we found uh like um it was like a gallery i don't know i don't know yeah and it has this uh it had this statement i am what i am doing what i am what i am what i am doing oh yeah and uh i think it's interesting because well we we've been talking with uh sev uh a friend who uh he's argentinian but he lives in the romance and and he was saying something about well i'm not the right person to talk about this but he was studying uh chinese for uh like many years and and he was telling like uh i think he's in this kind of present continuous thing that is related to japanese that uh when you are for example if you want to say you are in the house you are also the house like this idea of you are doing something but you are also part of what you are doing like that thing is also you and you are that thing yeah i mean but like also you know is what i found interesting and i think this is things like you guys are in a case of views you know like you're in a place for reason that i would like to be also with naoto in a structure that that's what what similar for instance what i was doing uh in mines what i was doing in motionbank was a case of use so it's basically then i have like you have a specific research into an ascending something and therefore i think i also think it could be interesting that you uh technically uh develop things you don't have to also but i think the any way you do that so how to say this like so all these things that we are talking are meta and [Music] i i see them they are very entangled and i think they're they're passing through things that we also work with now so um [Music] so this is a community it's becoming a community but but this is to say this is to say like the um in the case of used like uh what i'm trying let me put it back like i think one of the reasons why we now would not we decided to work like that because but it's the only thing we could do right that we could have doing something else it was just on distance and then just like the conditions give us the rest basically uh and that's it um so but like if you guys are not in the different place right so you guys you guys have like all the conditions it's completely the opposite that we know to myself we have or we have it still we don't have conditions uh so since you have all the conditions it might be interesting it might be not and any way you do it that you uh do what you're doing like as you you have you know if i think from what i remember in your research you have times where you start researching about some printing some paper so you do [Music] yeah some approach to you do some iterations in technical wanting to maybe do something maybe not but you do some research and clusters that you call these clusters i don't know i think somehow you you could you have a name i think for these clusters but yeah like uh scenic objects like objects yeah yeah this is interesting that you mentioned this because so you have you have modular objects then then in a way like then you're grouping them and you're degrouping them uh organically depending on what's going on but also but you can also think in terms of adorational performance is in the scenes perhaps like that's what i for instance what i saw at the beginning like for me that's kind of a scene but maybe it wasn't completely you know like i i was specifically speaking about this so you have all there was a complex image projecting a projection into different uh surfaces but there was also one square that it was just passing a simple oscillator black and white like the first thing that you see with a hydra like this simple square is what i'm called what i'm talking about like because if what you want to do [Music] we we went with this with auto sometimes when we talk about like leech for instance like if you body if in a way what you're doing is trying to glitch and work with errors the the glitches if you speak like not even conceptually but just what physically happens with the pixels on the screen is that they take over the screen very fast so um you might want to be more economic in the way how you glitch the how do you use how how you let the glitches uh put out put it out for instance i'm like bring it back to what i'm trying to say is and the first part it seems to me that kind of work because it was kind of simple but maybe it wasn't so simple i guess but i just i i was just i guess focusing just in this simple square uh and then afterwards then you you see all these things are just blending um and this is in reference to this this for me in a way work as a scene or moods you know and perhaps if i think choreographically speaking because i have approached choreography like that before is that when i have worked with complex systems that you are in a complex system for instance then i just work a lot and then i generate uh sets what i will call sets or scenes and then but i don't i don't generate a set structure of how these scenes are going to be triggered meaning that i'm not saying now go is in one two one three and four but depending of how the things are flowing uh then i will choose the two and then four going back to one uh but to have some kind of structure but uh so that it won't go to like just the chaos exactly no for instance in my case and that was one of the last things that i was like trying uh for myself and then i realized okay so this is something that i want to work that was some years ago uh maybe i like to work in that more now because now i understand a bit more of that is that um maybe like the the choreographic thing is a bit extreme but then because it because it deals with space and time then i was just really making sure that every single elements have all the combinations and i put it in uh i don't know if you have seen like how uh ana teresa like smacking her she makes uh choreographic choreography but anyway so i was just making like very a very complex network of possibilities in every single scenario which from the outside it's like completely banned because i was just sitting and i was supposed to give a speech that i whenever i never gave but then i was offering the people to some objects and then depending of of these things then i will start uh reacting like a fusion reaction depending of how the objects were uh touch or approach or things this was like for so to be honest i think that's not really practical because it just uh i think it was right before i stopped dancing and it was for me just to try some things and and then after i realized okay this can be done um that's not really practical because then you have to do so much work at the end you have basically a partiture so you have a score and you know exactly all the single possible elements of that convoluted network and and and they are in subgroups that are what i call as a scene or uh moods so i don't think should be so extreme like to go as in that perfection but perhaps you would like to start understanding how things might work for you i think i introduced this idea to you now sometimes when i talk about like like the simple or the simple uh approach to this that i'm trying to say is in improvisation dance you have zero grounds it's a place where you always you start so if you have technique of all these kind of things that will block an answer afterwards then you know there is some ground based ground from from where you can go back so if you start from there and you know you will have a performance of maybe 30 minutes it's very common then as a dancer you will have a common ground like ground zero but also point one two one three and then you play just with this and then you can go more complex in the way how you propose this yeah i i think it makes sense uh in the at the part that well i i kind of think maybe this is not something that we like literally said but uh when i think about this idea of these scenic objects it has a limitation because we are designing how to interact with this for example at first it was something static and then we added wheels to these uh objects because we know we can move it on the space and we also added these um curtains that you we can uh like um hide the screen or the show and and and we have like these kind of possibilities of interaction that uh i i think i'm quite conscious about what i can do with that because i don't see myself as a performer but i can be conscious about what can i do with that object what is the relation i have with that object when i'm performing and uh i think everything is not scripted is not planned at some point we are jamming because also we are doing visuals and while we are doing visual visuals we are kind of building something on the space also that is a fact and uh i think like uh these objects uh help us to move and help us to interact on the space in the space yeah yeah jump back to what uh jorge was saying about kind of you know this zero or ground uh i think it's like something i consciously do with live coding that i know that quite a lot of people like just you know keep adding things to the code like especially with hype or maybe title cycles well like you have patterns and then add more patterns more and more or with hydra you add kaleido and then you have like different colors and more layers uh but something i consciously do is just like erase everything maybe not everything but like chunk of a code and we just come back to something very simple uh like that's really something really practically with the code i do in that video i i think i did uh something uh more or less um then i was just thinking that like how can we do it with other objects is there something that we can [Music] yeah like is there something that we can define that we can come back to at one point in the performance let's say yeah i was thinking also that because now what floor was saying that in my experience then uh with um working with a person who comes from visual arts like for instance which is very weird because when i mentioned that for the first time people were like kind of offended of like like because i just translated literally to plastic art you know and then they were like what no you know they were feeling like that i was like okay no okay so it doesn't work anyway so in my experience working with juan pablo that i told you about this guy this person now is this colombian sculpture who works here who lives here house in my building is a colombian sculpture and [Music] i remember when i invited him to this choreography that i that i did i remember i was so scared like because like i'm i'm i'm freaking out of space and time and that's my knowledge and that's my also my limitation but then for him was completely the opposite because he's just have experience often and and he has this experience of on on stage he is very he does performances for quite some time but he comes from visual arts so then also he is very uh used to uh working in an ontological way with the material which is something that was very clear after a work with him and that was like five years ago then i still i can i can see for instance that this this is information that uh like in plastic in plastic or in free in visual arts or fine arts in fine arts yeah in liberal arts and fine arts then you have this ontological approach to material which is great for what you guys are trying to do so then in that sense i like that i see like flor is doing that naturally now that she comes very often and she's like i see from the things sometimes i see uh i guess it comes more naturally to her just to start like doing things yeah but also oh sorry no uh continue no i think that's it no uh that that this is these are things that that we also like already talk about for example if we what if we work with objects if we think about sending objects the materials has to make sense for example because if you think about what you are saying uh like this ontological identity of the materials uh can you repeat it for can you repeat it again because i lost you for a second ah yeah don't worry uh if you think about uh i think it's cool like this idea of thinking like uh the ontological identity of the materials if you for example work with a white balloon it's a white balloon it's a balloon like the meaning of a balloon it might be related also with a for example i don't know a party birthday connotations and and it's not the same you see in a balloon that faking a balloon and uh using another uh thing i don't know uh and and we are trying to to think about this when when we are working uh also maybe without really it was interesting uh because i think well this is something that i was uh talking today uh with some uh friends that were uh doing like uh they they have like a subject for uh for uh like homework and and they were interviewing uh me in spanish and that wasn't there because it was in spanish but i was saying to them that we also try to create these uh autonomous objects somehow uh and also like this idea of using for example these cursors that creates uh reflections and refractions on uh with uh the projector uh we kind of know that uh something will happen but we don't have like the total control of what is going on with with that uh i mean with with the light and and where this uh light is going to or how this is going to behave and and i think that that's the thing also we we play with things that we don't really know as you said before where is it going we kind of have a burly idea and i think that's part of playing with chaos somehow yeah so the video we just watched is the from the open house from last friday and there were some visitors and one of the i found it's really interesting uh question was that basically she was asking like how they are connected how these elements are like collected because i think people are used to like think you know there's like osc message coming from one to another and the visual is you know triggering her question was technical i think so i mean maybe it's it's vague but uh in that sense this context is very bad yeah but yeah in that sense like you know for us like technically most of the things are not connected but also it's connected or you can't see some connection right it's it's up to you how you see it but also you know it's not completely like random objects because for example the prints are from you know projections from hydra also i think maybe this could be i mean this doesn't have to be like this but perhaps could be served as a strategy is that so one thing first to clarify i think for me for myself now and what i'm going about to say it is that um because this is going to be recorded is that this is the um i'm i'm over avocado of uh advocate avocado okay no so i'm pro i'm completely pro um something that is just whatever you know and it doesn't mean it is whatever but it's a whatever yeah it's i i'm pro whatever i have this conversation today with we have uh we were in this meeting with uh with seeds and then [Music] i asked them to invite me to the coordination meeting because in my time i want to start taking more responsibilities with them and then i think i was basically just telling them i have this conversation with wooly afterwards so uli and myself we have a thing a similar if we will see this hello we have a similar approach or curiosities but i think a main difference that i didn't tell you is that i'm not concerned or i'm not interested in knowing say that because it's there's at this interest of art and science for both sides but then i think she's interested to see or i'm not interested to to know if art and science if they work together if they if if it's a good if it's a good match i'm not interested in that i'm interested for sure in art and science and work together but i'm not interested in the results and i think because her approach is what she's doing is very specific she's kind of like and she shared this with with us uh naoto and vienna remember that she's into part of her research is about how to measure the impact of the arts in science yeah anyway yeah so this is side like that's that's her struggle now that she has to for the stakeholders of big projects that we're talking about of big money is that she has to put numbers uh for that so i'm just saying that the only difference that i will that i will see with myself with is that i'm not interested to quantify the result meaning that for me whatever is fine um so okay so i was trying to say that wait okay this is introduction i was trying to say that that um perhaps because i understand that people want to understand i i understand that as a designer i understand that as a communicator so then say that said whatever so yes was the signer i understand that and in order to facilitate that i would propose for instance that if you have a durational performance that is like i don't know six hours five hours whatever is the time perhaps is you take from time to time so a time off where you basically it's clear that things stop you know lights are off whatever you know and you start doing a conversation so perhaps you could use the chat format that we have with now too but basically you are in a perform performance uh directional performance but then from time to time you can invite the people to talk and then you can like go in a conversation on conversations with people when you actually you also you do your best to and you maybe you could be prepared also to defend or what you're doing basically um so this that i'm saying is it doesn't have to be like that you know like in this format that i propose but perhaps you can think that maybe you can give agency for uh a more just like a straightforward uh western understanding of what is going on what you guys are doing because every spirit of questions and options to be honest like what i'm proposing more is like i'm thinking more like a producer is like because you guys would like this to sell this and then so you have to you you should be you should use that space to promote yourself basically um until i mean you have to see how much you can allow this capitalism to enter you know then it's up to you how much you allow this to happen but it's but i personally think it's completely fine to do that huh yeah and i think uh like i'm not i'm completely like you know uh for with that what's what you said that uh like when i heard that question of you know for example like how this element and that element is connected i think it's really interesting to say that you know it's not connected because it really gives a surprise to people you know if it's not like we're saying that okay we're using the sensor data and sending this to this with osc and uh changing the color for example which is kind of it's maybe interesting for people to hear but it's not giving any surprise because it's something you know technically possible and people who has understand you can kind of imagine but then if it's not connected it really gives opens up so many you know possibilities it can be yeah the choreography that we told corey was talking about or it could be if you're taking from technical side uh they can imagine you know how they can be connected or like yeah just give some agency to it yeah but also like we don't have or we don't find a reason why to do it like that i mean that would be make sense it could be yeah but no no what i'm saying is but because maybe you're going to a more complicated thing what i'm saying maybe which is the only thing you have to say exactly that you said we don't have a re this is this is what i'm bringing back richter speaking this is not the first time that an artist is basically speaking out and it still is a is giving space for somebody to ask what is happening like i don't know what is happening just so you know and that's it it just this will put the the the public at ease they don't have to understand why but they need to have some they need to know basically they don't understand they don't need to understand why you do something but i think they need to understand that it comes from they need to understand that you don't know yes i think so so to rephrase so again they don't need to understand they don't need to understand why why are you doing something but they need to what they need to understand you don't know yeah okay they don't need to understand why you're doing something but they they need to understand you know yeah interesting yeah i mean that's kind of the artist's statement right i mean artist statement can be anything but it should be i mean if it's there people can read it whatever it is and that's the easiest does the easiest way like in performance i see this very this is very often you know this is the easiest way to bypass the politics of the of the y uh in performances you find first very often you will have a score greeting score of how you're supposed to interact with the art installation or something this is this is the easiest way how to an artist uh gives a score for the audience to understand what to expect uh be serviced with the artwork oh yeah without them without the needs or i mean that's a different path also that i'm suggesting without the need to establish a manifesto that is the other place you know that still as an artist you said like you know you take the position that you don't know and you really give the reasons why you don't know because this is adding in this layer you say why you don't want to know which is what we did in the application i wrote about that you know like i don't we don't want to know and then i say why yeah we also like kind of be working with this uh i don't know if it's a statement but i didn't spot but at this point i feel like somehow it is like this idea of it looks as if it as if it's working but it's quite random like we in the end we are not pretending anything it's like it's it works we i don't know how but it works so maybe i know we have so many things we can talk about but it's not the four-hour chat session yet so we can uh because we talked about this idea i was just doing chat forever and ever we're not prepared for that so we can come back sometime but i think it's good um yeah like we floor and i we didn't do this uh chat session like we do it for best practices but maybe it's good to do it like this or you know always we can invite jorge or other guests and have some yeah insights we we just have a lot of uh conceptual maps and then yes okay maybe we should just close the this uh this because i think could be this would be a chat to to publish i think this is an interesting thing that we talk here could be other people can use these things so that's interesting for other people yeah so thank you for watching thank you youtube thank you thank you thank you youtube and youtube on youtube thanks for watching uh everyone liking the video everyone subscribing to this channel thank you you're not obligated but i appreciate it see you next time bye", "gnB8k71o-Ws": "foreign okay oh that was us we transformed into dots and lines and triangles uh hello naoto hello so that was that was the new sinclair pathfinder um fixed by you yes uh it's already actually five years ago i fixed it and you fix it whoa this is not green screen by the way yeah so we are in mainz germany uh the hawk school mines uh um where i am doing i mean motion bank for those of you who know who's motion bank for those of you better who don't know what motion bank is is a place of an iconic place for dan syntec technology and they are attached somehow as part of the and i have been doing here my internship uh for by the studies that i'm finishing and interaction design um yeah so then now to i came here to say hello and also because tomorrow we do a practice using the motion capture system the motion bank has uh so tomorrow we will be doing a practice for business yeah maybe we should use the pathfinder as well it's a fluid queer conversation between technology and bodies yes yes yes that's yes so yeah and tomorrow yeah i will see tomorrow i guess we will be doing a practice and also the br will maybe appear it's been a while we will see what happens yeah when was the last i think we did this like in december yeah yeah that was december the same way the practice yeah because we did short one at 10th house yeah that wasn't outsourced so you were remotely and then we did yeah we did did we do it when i was in japan i was yeah we did something like a kind of experiment for the utensils we did something i think we did a practice while you were at the house for the for the installation idea yes we did a practice we need one practice yeah i think that was because i won't consider like the the practice we didn't in town's house you were in the same place yeah anyway so let's say when we are not doing this regularly for let's say every week or every two weeks maybe from uh it could be six months i think i checked and uh last time because we had like a series of practices like last summer that were like in the same space like path that was the last time that we were doing practices yeah like the the but those like original practices in the same space and then that was path like we did like twice or three times like twice maybe and then like the hype like the performance hybrid yeah hybrid performance and then the other time in vienna that we did there's performance also yeah and then like before that there was the original series that we did and and i think yeah i guess also because i was busy in june with uh seats on the school thing like i think we had some in june so it should be like in june july the last time around that time yeah so it is like eight nine months yeah of like digital practice well again this is like a same space it's true because this is still will be like using br yeah it's not this comp i mean we will have motion capture vr and we're in the same space and we are in the same space also and that's why pro that's why i propose also to know to do like two hours instead of one hour and this format we use it when we were doing in the research at puff and when basically we wanted to fuss and yeah yeah so we'll see if this is very exciting to see tomorrow what happened yeah it will be like i don't know how it's going to be but i feel we but maybe it's good that we haven't done it for some time so it's not like we have the flow of the regular practice so it's like yeah but whatever comes is new yeah but also i'm curious because you have been working in a different way like but you have been working uh with glitches and with a similar content i will said i guess the approach is different but let's say the content in a way is overlaps uh uh the work that you have been doing with floor uh foreign probably should be one of the person who watched yeah i know that she could be one you know she likes to make videos yeah so um anyway so just gracias and but yeah so i'm curious because in a way you have been rehearsing in a different way but uh you have been working extensively with hydra um so i'm very curious you're moving too and you're moving also it's true so i feel completely behind because i get the last time you i i guess i use hydra and javascript before i was coming to mines oh because i i thought you did front-end development because i thought maybe you have to do front-end development and motion and i did from them i mean not for motion point but hydra for those who are watching i don't know it sounds like i'm talking to the audience like uh doing this hydra documentation stuff and uh that's kind of not like uh you know it's not like a commercial front end but it's still something that coding yeah would be funny to do like a practice like in the end we have the to do up with the front end with hydra no maybe not actually i made a to-do app with hydra i remember yeah that was one of the videos in youtube yeah with the framework yeah that you used torus yeah yeah i think it's fine yeah so what's up so shall we talking no i wanted to like like so i was waiting like for now to talk about this idea of um so uh in short so i have been working and i have been doing an applied research on the graphical representation of dance in vr at motion bank and it's applied somehow because or it's applied and it's not an artistic research in the sense that uh basically um i'm working trying to find the best the best uh geometrical model uh that can uh help for the experience of dancing vr yeah so it's applied in that way so like i don't know what's that's a good example but uh if you have like motion capture you have this like mostly like rigging with some 3d models or you can have a skeleton with just dots and lines but you just what you're doing is to explore what's what kind of representation right or like a geometric shape that can be i don't know uh so what was the goal again like the goal is like to give agency to the mover like the mover user so the mover is watching it the mover user is uh it's me in that case so it's the person who is inside of vr yeah so you see yourself then you see yourself you see a represent at an instance of yourself right that in this case uh is a geometrical figure that after a research and after passing through different model geometrical models i decided that it was a square controlled by the hands and by the feet so then you have a square where you engage the upper part of the body and the lower part of the body like just to be precise it's like square in a sense that you have four lines yeah yeah four yeah um yeah so but like is like what's the methodology like so it was like you are developing and also you are the subject you are kind of interviewing or examining yourself through the process or other people no like so maybe i think i can use in my text to then to go through this so i was uh so in my research what i'm doing is uh documenting in us in a form of a journal in a google document from a technical point of view and from a dance point of view what does it mean to work with a state-of-the-art technology for motion capture vr and a dance studio so basically with the state of the art uh or best conditions for dance and technology the motion bank has the possibilities that's partly that's why i invite naoto because like to use a motion capture system is very expensive and not only economically because it is first it's expensive but also time wise which at the end is money right so because i have been here so we can use the system but also is set it up so uh we don't have to spend that time also in setting up the system that we can just jump in record data and then go out after video data that's yeah that's really important because i remember so three years ago i was here uh to join the ccl which was organized by this motion bank and the choreography recording recording well you know it because i anyways like you know um so the thing was that the event was happening it's like a hackathon kind of thing for five days but not competition people just explore with technology and movements and although they have the space here they have they said had to set up like from kind of scratch at the kunsthale mainz by the river and yeah basically they brought all the equipment and set it up so mostly anton and florian they were like setting up the cameras and basically the same setup that you will see tomorrow we haven't seen it the cameras and the space where you can move but it was really hard like i don't know maybe just back then maybe the software was different but in the end i think we couldn't get the real-time data in like five days like they started sitting up and then it was like uh kind of you record it and then you process the data and you can take it uh later yeah but it's not like you move and see the lines moving you know that's so yeah this is this that's very uh it's interesting that you mentioned that because so at the beginning of the process i have been here at the end will be for er eight weeks not nine weeks so and the total of my internship is three months um which started with a ccl in berlin um that is a different topic to talk at a different time because it was very special anyway and um so in the early week so when i came here right away i think the first week anton which is like the person who really carries all the technical system in a way of motion bank he's so he knows so much man so he's like so much i don't know so much anyway uh he's funny and he's super cool and he's super easy going he's so he's just he's a clown he's a nice uh friendly clown he is super easy like uh anyway hello now tommy if you are seeing this um and um so he showed me how it works like you know like the first or friday this is this uh you record like this bye-bye i go and so i was oh okay um but then i my idea was to work towards real time motionbank has uh this application that was developed by anton in actually for that ccl that is called effect layer effect data player is an app that allows you to read and specific exported uh data uh wait so the system which is capturing this does the name of the of the motion capture system the product is a product from some company from capturing company i don't know it's called so yeah that's a product called it's called capturing um how you call this kind of motion capture this is a markless right yeah markerless camera like image-based is this is based on artificial intelligence no yeah it's exposed like estimation yeah like opposed net or open pose this kind of thing but with a multi camera so yeah gives 3d points yeah it will use like 12 cameras and from there it will basically rig a skeleton a volumetric figure a skeleton of your body um so he so he that exports a b b v hash format that's the data that the data format of the of the data does the data that you get from capturing let's say i mean apart so you get all the 12 12 raw footage you get the footage of each of the 12 cameras like videos videos and different things uh in really big formats like metadata major data like different things that i show you today um but so what is relevant for this conversation is like then what you really so that you use this that baby hash format that i think is a 3d kind of format um to so you use that date that uh that extension and you transform it with the application the anthem created and then you have a proper a property uh file i don't know what specific uh extension that you get you transform the data into something that is readable for effect data player okay i don't know exactly what it is but the only way you can read the data afterwards is with the effect data player so you uh so back then um i i was i needed to use the data from defect data player okay so you capture and then convert it and then you reload it from the the data player into touch designer and touch designer yet because data player is just like a kind of hub that you connect other programs with websocket and i think in one of the previous uh chats uh we showed that like at some point when i was early when i still i was in brussels one time one of the previous chats i show the fake data player and then we see this so it was basically the the hub indeed of the data was passing through the effect data player and then via osc the effect that a player was sending the data to touch designer and intel's designer is the tool that i'm using for data visualization um so that was at the beginning i needed to do it in this way still but i was looking for towards going uh real time then the way how we did it was through uh unity so then we instead we replace the effect data player for a unity plugin so capturing has this already made plugin uh [Music] and then you can send in real-time data from capturing to unity and then from unity via osc to touch designer but at the beginning was so that was not working and anton needed to work on that so i was for i think two weeks like yeah i think until the second week he found some time and he make it work because he needed to make it work in c plus plus and and i think these days what he works is like it's javascript right i see so he needed to make it work but i mean at the end i think he's just like he did it just with me he just because i think that plugin is already made you just have to make it work yeah right and but anyway you need to yeah you need to dive into c plus plus again anyway so he made it work and then i found then i have that from the second week i have already a real-time data and he showed me how to calibrate the system i didn't understand to be honest and i didn't really need it to do to recalibrate i only recalibrate the system uh in the fifth week before the week that i went to visit the endorment because already i was testing and i was needing some more uh i needed to have more feedback from the system i started using the floor i needed more responsiveness i needed to have a system more yeah i needed to recalibrate the system but is it like the cameras were like a bit off or you had to change the position so that not so the cameras are you don't push sensitive yeah but uh it's just the calibration you know is this kind of these things yeah i think what happens with motion capture in time is like it's so like the issue like knowledge but like i think it's just like physically like with the weight it starts to deform the clamps or like the structure it's like the cameras are attached to so like at some point you have to calibrate somehow like yeah it's not like a really stable thing and even if it's you know slightly moved you have to calibrate it again to get precise results so probably that's what happened yeah it's just this time yeah but there were so many things like uh but yeah anyway just not sorry conversation like there's so many factors also i remember the day that i thought okay i want to calibrate now i need to start having more uh responsiveness of the system and i spent so much time trying to recalibrate the thing like more than two hours and at the end it was so i was i think i was giving too much samples and the system every time has to wait until it shows something and sometimes good but not so good so at the end i remember i did it quite fast and was good after two hours i realized that actually you need to give not so many samples yeah uh and and then it will be fine yeah camera calibration is like really tricky like you kind of have to have like uh like it's like you have to something master you know something you have to master and then you yeah like it's all these little tricks and it's like not something you can like learn by you know from reading something but yeah but so i think in research i have this thing like i spent like five weeks i spent i spent five weeks until i got a system that it was reliable something that i was more or less comfortable using and so it took me five weeks until i was doing that so in that process of today's the camera tomorrow is the storage of one of the systems to uh the day after might be a file optimization between three different os systems because i'm using the ubuntu windows and mac so all these things put together it took up to five weeks until i was like more or less like okay now i have something more or less that i can trust um so i was saying that because i was kind of okay and then from there and then i started like uh doing more of applying a methodology which in a way was basically proposing more geometrical models then test them in vr go dancing uh annotate or document how was the process of dancing you know was it good or bad in relation to this model adjust them and propose i mean adjust the model and do it again that was the methodology that from the first week i thought i will just apply that's what i'm saying and underline the applying research i propose this model and the idea was just to do iterations with the model with the methodology and only from the the sixth week i start doing applying somehow the methodology because that could trust the system but then from the six week also i start thinking after a conversation with florian how to capture the state and then from that moment then everything changes because then so then if the research was about wait because then i think i just easy i can reach this so after a feedback session with florian and janet i realized it and clarified that my focus on this research is not on aesthetics not normal composition i will argue that my score is on experiencing and trying to capture the change on the state to formulate communicate with the system that i set up to pass along in the form of an online document that others and myself can revisit so the whole and i was in conversation with him it says like you know what you're here like because my my idea from the beginning in fact if uh by the way like so this is a this will be a document that would be online so you guys also can see it um so in the document early in the document i said and also it was in in berlin that i remember i took with anthem what i didn't know what was gonna read this and i said like i was asking him about somehow like an internship and he said like what do you want to do and i was like and then i start working this idea of mapping uh yeah like data to visualization yeah like my original like the original idea of the research was about like applying choreographic thinking on the mapping process that goes in data visualization which how would you define mapping yeah in this context for listeners yeah i mean just because mapping can be like because actually it's funny because the word i was not sure what you meant like when i like now i think i understand it but at first you said because you're always saying you know i'm gonna work on mapping and um because mapping can be like anything but um i guess what you mean is like you get the data from the motion capture like bunch of points and it's it's like how to map it or like what to do with the data no no no no no actually if you go more noise even going for it i can use the also what i have in the document it's like i think it's even coming from wiki map and so the mapping definition from wikipedia defines mapping as the process of creating data element mappings between two distinct data models so within advanced context this means part of the human body will represent will be represented and translated into data so that's why i used that because it says defines mapping as the process of creating data elements mappings between two different two different two different between two distinct data models meaning one data model so this is about matrixes one data model or one matrix will be the human body as a matrix in a way and the other one will be visualizations and br so there are two ways to structure information to relate one the human body as a uh as a as a group if you think in the practice and grouping and grouping so one understanding the body as a group and the other one data visualization as a group so two different ways to relate these two informational systems but like i i think it's quite important so i i just want to clarify when you say the data of the body is that something kind of conceptual in the sense of like physical body or what you already captured with the motion capture no no that's just like the what i'm saying what i said it's just the this is just cognitive in the senses uh this is an arm this is a leg it's just the way how we understand the human body so it's not about the data but it's about the yeah like the cognition yeah it's about like how you speak about yeah because i think it's and then how you basically because that's what i was mentioning that it works in the as a matrix uh as a matrix in mathematics but maybe we can see what is a matrix hey cd what is a matrix in mathematics a matrix is a rectangular array or table of numbers symbols or expressions arranged in rows and columns which is used to represent a mathematical object or property of such an object should i keep going no thank you that was silly so but that's what i was mentioning the matrix it's just about how to structure information so that's why i use the wiki because in the wiki they use this reference of two distinct data models again then i'm mentioning the body as a data model meaning arm legs head as a data model that you can put it in in an excel sheet vis-a-vis uh other model that you still have to define as data from motion capture for instance right so that you still have to define yeah no it's just that i think now it makes more sense to me um and i think it's like yeah i have to read the document again like to kind of see all these details but it's like one thing i just thought is is really like depends on the target readers like for this text but it is really like important to choose the right words or like define the keywords because for mathematic like you know people in like mathematics or people in programming this mapping word can or people dance like people can have like really different interpretations and some people really take it like really like well everyone takes it serious but like uh can be like misleading depending on audience um and i mean it was happening already with me so yeah yeah i mean of course like you can argue that you know i should have read the documents thoroughly but then it's not always case that people would read it yeah but no i cannot like yeah it's a it's a it's not really ambiguous work so a word so it's true like yeah yeah because i think mapping if you think like the first thing you will think is a map which is not far away from reality maps you know like a graphical i mean the visualization like on the map of a country is basically is structuring information also i don't know because i thought it's more like literally mapping because it's not the you know the physical space but it's a representation because it's mapping uh from this physical space or a coordinate into the coordinate of the paper so between two different systems yeah two two different yeah system or two different i don't know coordinates to be like which is like the matrixes are like defining those basically to coordinate systems right but what's tricky here is that it's not necessarily the numbers or digits that we're working with like when it comes to mapping in like more broader sense because if we're looking at the like a geographical map it's still like we're talking about numbers like we know that which position in this space in which position in the paper and when i think about for example like mapping in like you know using processing to map body into like lines then it's the same thing because like body in a sense that like let's say you use kinect or some motion capture then we already get the data the numbers where x y z of the joints for example that you get this set of data and then you map it to lines and map it to circles it's still like we work with exact coordinates within the same system within i mean different systems always it's mapping i mean it can be same system but the physical space of motion capture area into the 2d visualization of the screen or window but i don't know if you meant like because you said cognitive it's like because it's not something that you can i mean this is kind of becomes like a trackable quality thing as well but it's not that we have the exact position of the joint because you can define where the joint is or like you know shoulder can have like different joints in your body and what you get in motion capture is kind of abstraction that you have you assume that it's like a solid skeleton that you are wearing and it's already there is this mapping from this physicality into the data of the motion capture yeah it's not the body it's not the body it's it's actually the body yeah yeah yeah it's representation of the body yeah yeah yeah but yeah so i think that's like this like the conversation with nothing that can go in the infinite like it's better but it's a it's a very uh complex thing because um because of all the things that we were just saying so maybe we should pass that yeah so uh daniel busy a person who is doing a research here and somebody who knows a lot about artificial intelligence he was he was doing a research on mapping but really from yeah i guess all these complex things that we just spoke somehow um but yeah so i think what i wanted to tell you somehow it was about this course we were talking about like annotations and scores at the end i think i wanted to tell you so like in the first so it took me like five weeks to define like the system and then the sixth sixth week i started working with this at how to capture the state so how to how to how to use the system that i have that i set up to capture my state for me to afterwards communicate and pass along for people um and then during that process is when i got really stuck because i thought okay this is about i need to use annotations but also scores and then i was like okay these two things are really entangled with the state and i get like stuck for two weeks in this process and then in the process i talked with the david the written i think and it's called de la junta which are part of motion bank and founder of oh ccl as well i mean motion bank and ccl yeah i think it was like yes it was the beginning house with the four-step company also uh scott uh and he's kind of like a a really well known person in digital dance and digital dance and technology i guess and so anyway i think it's easier if i just use things on my text to not go around um hmm so i at some point in the document in the in the journal and say okay so officially i'm stuck thinking about thinking about annotations and scores i don't know what to record um yeah then i also put in in the notes like for tomorrow morning as today i refuse to dance without knowing my purpose why can't i just dance i'm kind of numbed i don't know what to do i am struggling don't know what to do about annotation scores this seems to me goes towards composition aesthetic functional or structural decisions that might improve the work i am not composing an art piece i am applying choreographic thinking somehow this is applied over structural while coding so as you see as you can feel in that it's just i'm it seems to me that is all these things are super entangled coming from different places wait so so in a way so annotations are a sensitive effective effective process in choreographic figures which is the book that i use very often in this research don't remember exactly right now the writer but then they define notations so no annotations but notations they they refer as in two ways like you can see it in two main different ways one that is singular and the other one that is shareable meaning that one of these annotations can be um only for yourself so could be part of the process so you don't need could be grapples could be drawings that people don't really have to understand but or could be shareable they in a way divide these notations uh that is not annotation but there's a way to notice so you you're talking about notation and annotation i'm so i'm talking this from the perspective of annotations okay and in the book they refer about annotations we think uh not to notice like when you are in a practice like this practice of sense making or like you go into the space and then you start basically figuring out what you're gonna do then when you notice there are change in dynamics of energy how you react to things so when there are changes on the state then you notice then you basically or you write down or you find strategies to how to capture the state somehow okay um yeah i like i don't want to be like uh i keep asking the keywords but uh like already i have a lot of questions because like so my understanding of notation is something like for example like double notation that you kind of more like a score that you can write but it's it could be a score but it's something to represent like the movement for example and annotation is something more about the quality that for example you watch the rehearsal or the performance and then at this time you did something you or like you know it can be comment or it can just description of the movement i mean that's something i know about annotation dance annotation that motion bank has been doing uh that's notation and annotation and there's another question that i had i didn't ask because i thought it's gonna block the flow but what is the state you know like what do you want to do so you were saying like you want to capture the state but is it like a internal state is it like a external state or is something so so i didn't i think i then i referred like i base this in in part from the book and i just define it i go with the exchange on dynamics and one is like energy dynamics so when i feel the energetically something is changing so then it's more physically and then and the other one there is more uh cognitive more like my brain is doing um like consciously thinking like okay i should do this for example when there's changes in dynamics yeah could be but it could be i mean it's probably different for everyone yeah but i think i think at the core wait what was it i think i was in the book they define it i don't i don't see that it's in the document i don't remember by heart but i think that the idea is like there are changes on dynamic and i think they use this idea of figuring and figure um but then i think then we go to another it becomes endless this so because i'm trying just to go to a point here is that but i will say like the state will define be defined as a big picture when there are changes on dynamics energy dynamics and that could be physically uh that i decide now to move there or could be then just like that while still physically staying i know that now i start thinking on my mom so still in both states uh there are chains of dynamics one is physically and the other one is mental but there is a change on a dynamic and then i have to then i can go with it or not go with it yeah that's i think you wrote something about state like about time or like space i think because like what you just said sounds like the state in terms of like more like a yeah change that you said because for me like what state sounds like is like kind of a snapshot in time so it's like not not change but like what was before the change and after a change but you wrote something about it right but i think like bulls are related like that uh i think both are in like the state somehow but this is that i don't find it i guess the right words but it's in the document should be is in relation to is a snapshot yeah on time um but if you go it goes goes somewhere so let's say into a practice will be is in relation to how you can again to so in my practice i was trying to find the ways how can i uh find uh strategies that help me to capture the state so then to notice with annotations or with something that something changed now now i need to put it all in a paper or like one of the strategies that i took in in the research is like i create a sphere and then i put it in a 3d space so then if i was with the br and something happens then i just go inside of the ball then afterwards then i could see then i can notice maybe i was trying to say something i was doing an annotation let's see because you have to do an annotation by yourself in real time that you don't you won't don't want to miss but so like maybe i just will go i think to this like shortly because i think it it touches different things quite clear um so in conversation with david i asked him what are annotations in the context of dance and technology how do you see them how do you use them so because of the conversation entangled different aspects on different fields i will just put like a bullet point so that's the way i describe it here from the conversation with him he will speak about dom commenting rehearsal descriptive you can jump not have to see all the video keywords pay attention take decisions more cognitive than sensual it helps to take distance from material so then what i write is annotations are a sensitive effective yet effective process uh that in the book are in a big picture divided in two ways a singular for yourself or shareable then you have to articulate more and make and know that other people will go into that but then other way that i see this this is more so that's the book and then the way how i see it in my case is a description so uh to communicate uh or in composition and this composition can go individually or in a collective so in a nutshell i see annotations i said in two main different categories one that is life in person and there are strategies to notice that something has changed example that i was used the being sphere that i mentioned or post with the pre-recorded map with a pre-recorded dance material and you can be like you can use it to try to new findings on new material or to dive into unknown dance material or to uh yeah so but in a big picture i see it or life or a post are two different things and that's going to what you were saying that's what at some point i got really you know like this thing confusion that you have i was like in that space for two weeks like and uh what is that i have to do with this old this thing these tools um and then is when then after in the documentation i start uh speaking about this thing so like like so this is somehow is like related to this course so then i will just read the same thing that inc in conversation with scott i asked the same question that i asked about annotations to david and then i have some bullet points instructions meaningful marks how is the score accessible mark marking practice make accessible for others like an anthropologist principles that can be used for others things that happen if you think you don't have enough time you can speculate is the score accessible what does it communicate in a choreographer hands book jonathan borrow says a score is a conscious way to distance you from the thing that you are making or doing i will go one step further and that's my assumption and add the annotation and scores have in common that they are a conscious way to distance you from the thing that you are making or doing so based on the information that i collect from different sources and include my own experience within my context i see the score in two ways i script what is going to happen in a space digital or digital virtual or physical for certain amount of time or a suggestion why might happen in a space during certain amount of time so i'm overloaded and but i have constructive comments like why i'm overloaded and why i'm saying this because i think this journalism borrows um wars are really important that i think i mean you're already doing this process but like by like talking with having like uh comments from others but like i think it's really so you're the kind of developing practice not just like a practice in terms of being there and using vr but you are developing this whole like methodology and process and but you are the but that's the pros process that's the practice you develop that's really that's so valid but at the same time you are in there and you are analyzing or like investigating yourself so it's very hard to communicate with others like i know that you're using i mean you're going through all these um books and ideas which is really helpful but like still at least to me it's difficult to grasp because there are so many details that i cannot understand because i'm not in that process basically and i think that's really like what we the same problem as we had in the practices that we've been doing that we really understand and we share that between us but it's always so hard to communicate with other people that other people know that okay it's something something that is valid something interesting but still it's hard to understand yeah i feel the same with like what you've been doing that it's so valid it's so valuable but at the same time i have to say okay i'm overloaded or like i yeah okay that's something really good but i don't understand and i think yeah like but that's something that we have to think about i mean the kind of big picture that like how to deal with this struggle and i think in the end we have to kind of really like narrow down like we strip off like so many things and like decide like what you want to communicate because we have all this knowledge experience practice but if you want to tell this rich thing to other people then you have to like choose what's the core and you have to like kind of well maybe not simple language in the academic context but it's still like it's it's the same in the academic context because in the academic context for example if it's like a dance researcher then they have some kind of like words that they use yeah so like you have to like kind of adapt to that which you have to like take all these like rich things like flesh from the what you have and you know strip down to this like really skinny bone but like i think we have to go through that process somehow like for our practice for your practice for my practice but yeah exactly so that's what i was mentioning like that's and i think i was trying to do that today when when we were walking that like the experience to being forced and try to communicate these things is really complex because they are entangled an applied thing or a practical thing that is functional we think technology we can embody stuff that already is hard and it's so multi-disciplinary that it's like so embodied but also so distanced from the technology but that's why for instance so because basically uh i completely agree in what you said like for instance to in this specific case what i guess you will have to do is a process that that's what i decide at some point is not what i'm doing right now i'm just doing a journal that is and a part of the abstract at the beginning the paper it says like concepts here will be constantly like mentioning different times like i'm constantly contradicting or re-revisiting things because it's the way how how how it happens um but what i realized is but you see that basically you will have to go few times in loops until you get the essence what you're trying to say so i completely understand what you're saying but then basically you have to first trying to communicate already that's so and that's so and that has been the exercise of just doing this journal yeah i mean this itself is the practice it's kind of uh yeah in the meta level or yeah yeah maybe not and then i think i have to say like and then with this i also like to say like to thanks also to to florida like to motionbank elsewhere to to is that i i feel very lucky in the sense that that because i have a specific case of use uh so in this case trying to find the best graphical model to help me to dance in vr and experience that in vr then i can start then i was forced to try to find words otherwise uh i will not have or i mean i'm not i'm not forced to do that so yeah like does their case for instance even though for instance we have the chat there is a space that we try to think but we're doing is not the same of like trying to reduce and even it's for us that we do for the chat so that's i mean that's the first step to communicate yeah yeah yeah yeah i mean yeah so many things um i want to expand but also i think we should i think we should stop uh but wow this feels this has been way longer yeah i mean this is just 55 minutes but that's quite long uh yeah but open stock yeah um but yeah this um like i think like um it's just so important i think in this context of dance ever yeah i think in our country's dance and technology with art and technology and dance and technology is to try to talk about what you're doing because the difference with art some house are liberal art fine it defines their own its own language and in this field because it's so attached to design and functionality it needs to i mean the exercise of being forced to to communicate is uh is so uh important and it's already like you know two parties from dance and technology they speak completely different languages yeah and that's like you know and that's why it's not happening so much but like so that's what i was trying to say like to you like from my experience for instance like then i see like now after being with motionbank for three months i understand also getting this i'm talking getting from conversation eating the pizza with florian and all these things that and actually in the text at some point i said like it's called it speaks about is that motion bank was uh like this idea that the people normally will have a motion bank uh and the graphical representation of the foresight and these big companies into this cool stuff this is more related to a score in the sense of what you do with that data but uh that was an early stage of this emotional emotion bank but motion bank now is more about annotation and then in a way is like both things are intrinsical but i know in a way the score in a way is kind of like a big umbrella where annotation in a way comes in like an example of this for instance is like annotations are more complex to understand because they are so sensitive and different layers but a score is more practical yeah yeah i get because i was like thinking about some examples like score can be really like let's say level notation again like something that is really like literally literally but literally a score means in in in german apart it means literally a score is the script that the musician will read so in that sense that's what i define in between two ways and that's uh actually is boris who defined it between one a script that is just you know exactly from begin to end before starting what is going to happen which is a music script but also could be a suggestion in dance let's say it says so even though it's a script somehow it's more like suggestions of what things that might happen yeah you don't have to do it but there are suggestions yeah but that's something i was thinking with like so so notation can be you know very rigid but also for example like they were hey that motion black worked with in the past uh that's like just text right and some drawings that is a score but are you talking about like now like though i know with the score score i'm talking yeah yeah so it's like looks like so open-ended but in fact it's about doing the performance so it's like kind of you know trying to kind of converge to something like if it even if it's so big so abstract it's something that is has an aim to do the performance yeah but then annotation is it is so open-ended like it can be anything anything and it doesn't have to converge but it's no other way around it might converge also but like for instance like that's what it was i guess more complex i think for reason like a good case scenario like with real things with clients like dance technology people is like moses in a way is close to score you know people will understand and just get into it's a polishing tool somehow but the pins maker as a thing is hard to get because like why should i use this thing you know so annotations are an effective and yet effective process that has so many layers that only with experience in years of this thing that you can in a way grasp uh but it's yeah what you said is like it's just um it's not the thing that you will see in first it's not the score is something that you will ratify you right away yet both are uh and interrelated yeah of course yeah yeah perhaps we can expand on it or we can talk about something that i guess we can do another chat tomorrow hopefully we'll see what happens tomorrow energy i think now is 11 although official is just 10. well no officially officially yes it's biologically or you know like we are intended yeah but we're still wondering between time zones but yeah so maybe just be close here yeah so we'll do it uh i don't think it's going to be live streaming but no no maybe but no upload we will upload it all right enthusiastic uh people please watch it once it's uploaded uh thank you for watching please like the video and subscribe to our channels and we'll see each other in the next one bye", "YIGWbkaRnZY": "what up people check it out my people where should we start how is it going with you guys what the  you guys are doing guys you guys live in the meta world absolutely it's so it's so funny to see like then i'm i i have sometimes i'm like i have different like i think there's no words like it's just like i'm like what is that you know and you guys are like in a meta world [Laughter] is broken and then you are like what this glitch glitch is just like spitting out um yeah i don't know what to say like we started like last month and well if you're watching on this youtube channel probably you saw like you like the viewer you have seen videos but uh we've been playing with hydra of course and then we started projection and we did photogrammetry and plotter and like cutting paper with like this vector svg files and then we started [Music] what's next [Music] we put some laser at some point we have two projectors dnx lights which is live code like we live called dmx lights and we just started like hanging stuff with laser cut objects and projecting on it and now today we built um like sensors into this laser cut cursors so now we can what what which sensors did you put in that yeah for what so where is attach that to the cursor this sounds really ridiculous like the cursor it's like a laser cut like like a computer like cursor but it's like a laser cut just the shape of the cursor you put a sensor on the on the thing that is plotting no no it's just a it's just an object just just a cut like laser cut object and i don't know if i can show you the photo i think i just sent you this but um these ones ah i thought it was a laser cutted something this is laser cut i thought they were and then ah so you put in these arrows now i understand you let's see the cursor yeah that was closer so the idea is like you were gonna hang them and it has a sensor so we can like just play with it and it's attached to sound or lights or whatever with osc messages so they so they how actually wait so so the cursor then is yeah he's reactive like a yeah he's really doing something if you move the cursor something happens like yeah yeah um then wait if how actually you guys are sending osc in so are you sending always see like on the web no it's just like wired to arduino and arduino is connected to the computer with usb and there's a node.js that's receiving accelerometer values and then process it with fft create transform so it kind of you know separates signals that are like fast moving or slow moving and then that's sent to tidal cycles with osc to but that's the question because then it's still because the way how i mean how i work is just i'm i'm having so i have like i have capturing and then capturing uses uh it sends some pro proprietary data uh via unity some unity plugin in live capture capturing and then in unity in another computer in the same network i receive that and then i send that to the same computer in touch designer uh bosc but all of this is a part of the capture is just always see in the same network that's what i was because normally yeah i mean i i i know that it's difficult to when you want to send osce through the web is open sound control through because wait like you're using title yeah internet like with title cycles like you guys you you're using them cycles is uh no it's a super collider it's uh local it's just an application ah okay yeah so it's the same okay okay oh i thought i thought it was browse base yeah yeah i thought it was browse-based but i think i would do that too like send it to the web and then you know people can see it on the browser with but i think because i from what i understand i think if you try to do that process then you need to use web sockets yeah you have to continue because of the constant yeah you have to convert it to you need to keep them open because if i mean for other people that are seeing like in the web uh on the web you you as a client you can have just one uh uh request one answer and so yeah osc is constantly sending different values so you need to have something like a websocket which is you you subscribe to the websocket that is a protocol that allow to receive more than one message at the time yeah and it's a response yeah yeah yeah i think we'll do that too like uh for example like when we like called dmx lights we do it on the browser second and that's like sending that websocket to the server i was saying that because of the because of the dmx because that was one of the questions that you will find sometimes in the in in this court channel from hydra people then the uh about yahoo ac because of the dmx i mean the mx is so easy to work with because basically with all with uh the light that manauto has at the background is is a dmx light i think this is like automated but it's it is also dmx like yeah yeah so it's a protocol that allows it's a very practical protocol for lighting because if you work with pixel pixel-based systems then basically you can have like a vj can have a projection of uh i don't know like a landscape with flowers and so [Music] and then with dmx you basically you map the lamps as pixels depends how how big are your pixels and then automatically the system will get uh so you have the background as this landscape right and then there's an image as an image so as a bj let's say you have a background and then what you do is in the whole in the whole space so then my background there i have a projection uh mapping but then in this space where the people are dancing everywhere that actually here i'll start some dmx there will be lights and what i what you can do is that these lights can be represented as pixels uh one of the pixels of this background and then what they will do is generate this atmosphere so it kind of bleeds out to this space the image kind of spreads out exactly yeah but so it just generates it's a simple way to generate uh an atmosphere that's the word that i'm trying to find so with that with whatever image that you're using so like mbj very glitchy or complex images but then automatically because you select pixels from that image onto the whole space even though they will be different colors they will be coming from there so that you will create an atmosphere yeah and so that's exactly the other yeah actually the other team uh right next to us is uh doing the same like similar technique so they have a projection on the screen and they have like led strips around it and i think that's sampling the image from the projection so it has kind of similar colors on the side yeah yeah yeah yeah and it's so simple to are you using like uh do you use rnet or or dmx i i don't know about the specifics so you just have the usb to dmx like integ yeah yeah yeah because for instance like in the application in the installation that we did with seats that it was this big installation in a big space um so when you need to wreak a big space uh so rather than having all these cables constantly uh then what you do is then you have like the uh the art net allows you to have a wireless connection with the with the system [Music] yeah so it's so still they need to be wired you need to rig them but they don't need one computer to be plugged uh they have this r net uh hub that it will be as soon as you are in the same network it will be on and then you can just control everything exactly wireless so yeah and and also what people use is now is that they have this this is very you have this so instead of connect the dmx uh desi chaining i think is called when you when you connect one up with the next one and the next one the next one uh people use it uh wireless transmitters but each of those things are like 10 euros oh so so they're quite expensive um but yeah so i think that's really in concerts and stuff like that people use instead of cables uh is wireless so if you don't really if your problem is not a budget which is let's say in the case of a concert it's just wireless and it's just yeah you don't have the problem of the cable thing and it's just such a it's just so powerful yeah well it's getting really technical but i i would add another technical thing that actually it's funny that uh we're doing what you said about the making the atmosphere we're doing the opposite because there's one uh web page uh like collaborative javascript page like block that floor and i connect on the same page and then we code and now the dnx control and hydra is in the same page and you can you know in hydra you can use these arrays to switch between numbers yes like which are like array like you know this bracket and then you have like different numbers and it will just like make a sequencer all these values and yeah yeah so so what i did what we did is hydra has uh let's say like a master fader that switches on and off and dmx lights also have that but it's inverted so the projection goes sometimes off and that's when the light comes in and we can like but they like everything but the light is mapped to hydra's pixels no it's just a javascript that you can change numbers also but so you're not a so question are you guys mapping i thought you guys were mapping hydro sketches light in your in your in your use are you guys i just made a i just made a new uh like some functions to change color of the light just like hydrating so it's like completely separate but everything is in javascript yeah okay yeah yeah of course like for somebody like me like i'm used to work and i will i then you have this software who will do these things so you just you put whatever image that you put that and then just you select depending of the feature that you have it will give you some amount of pixels and then just you so that's what the way how i imagine that you have hydra that's what i was like thinking how in the how in how can you have this web-based uh so this internet thing this browser image and then uh use the pixels uh to output something locally uh because it isn't it's a yes it's an analog signal that it goes hardware it's a harder word hardware yeah yeah so there's a lot of like technical complexity but when we perform it's all on the browser like it's it's wired somewhere because from the browser you can send websocket to your own computer so if you have like node.js program running on your computer you can send commands from your browser to it and then node.js is running on your computer so you can do anything with the hardware whatever you want from node.js so if you send websocket from the browser to say okay light on light off node.js will listen to it and node.js can trigger that which i i built with the node.js oh man i want to see that yeah yeah i want to see that yeah yeah it's it's not too complicated but it's uh you know it's like something that i that's so i think that's something interesting it's really tricky it's a like tooling like to make tools that we can use it for performance because it's just what i'm trying to figure is just i i stay in my head with this like it's trying to see like what is the pipeline you know i'm trying to see like what is the pipeline where is going um but wait like like one thing and then we just close that apart is that yeah so when you guys are performing in flock it's called yeah um that's that's web-based right you're using the same url yeah right so then then you're using just hydra normally uh i mean with the internet right yeah and then when you that's what you're saying when you're not using hydra then you will run the script to put the lights in your [Music] and you're sitting there you're projecting these two projectors right but then if you're not using hydra then you start using the dmx lights on on you well we are using hydra but we just like virtually turned off you just say for example if you say color zero zero zero then it's just blank yeah so that's how we turn it off so it's still running but you just turn but like make project black color yeah yeah yeah so the projection it's just like yeah project is your project in black and then at that moment the lights are on you guys yeah and it but then the lights are not mapped lights are not maps because lights we just say i want this color for light but but you took that but you mapped like did you map with some software like or did you map the projection for the projection you not like yeah with open frameworks like ages ago that projects like lines like patterns and then scan the space and you can so you have like a map like a mask of the space like we could generate it automatically and we just use it as a mask this is this so i think i'm doing the question that you will have normally like this is the kind of thing that people will ask you when you're working with technology exactly what exactly like people asking that question yeah what what is the self-worth that you're using which tool are you using but i i'm already like so confused because like you know as you can see like i'm using open frameworks i'm using processing i'm using node.js for osc and dmx and also hosting web and of course browser with hydra and flock and like it's just like you know i have to like constantly go back and forth and now i was doing arduino and uh what else yeah today i spend most of the time just soldiering oh [Music] joe kaimu is so good and slogan hi guys i'm really good at soldering i did my masters in soldering with him she's really really good doing that um okay how does how is it the collaboration with with floor i think we're still like i mean last month for the first weeks like i was we were kind of figuring out i think now it's it's getting uh more fluid like i know what's my strength and i know her like she knows her strengths and like also you know just to have uh not to stress too much about uh who's doing what i mean i mean it's also like when when i work with you because we have different skill sets so just not to be you know stressed that you're doing less or more that's i think that's kind of the always uh tricky thing but i think i don't know how it would do but that's interesting to see because for instance like this is something that already i think we but we passed long time ago you know i think or like how much are you doing how much am i doing you know like that being worried of like for reason like you have more knowledge with technology than myself so i remember at a big time ago i was struggling with that um i think it seems really far in the past yeah i mean it's it's also different i think also like we are kind of i mean with floor it's like we are literally like building up the space well demolishing and building up but we have something physically and with you it's it was like always spontaneous i mean even that puff like you know like we were trying things like spontaneously so how long did you guys spend like in in so how how long we'll go a session what are you doing like your sessions uh we don't set time so like more or less like we start you know building stuff during the day and sometime like maybe at four or five we if we have something we try to perform with it and normally like 30 minutes 40 minutes maybe one hour and at first we were trying like actually the first few sessions were like purely with flock so we just have image on the screen and we're just screen recording it and then we started projection and then light so it's more physical space we're using and that became more interesting because like last few times like we started to play with objects and like not coding so much like the practice yeah yeah which yeah you see i mean it's way more interesting if we stop yeah yeah it seems more yeah that you guys found something where you can stay there for a while yeah and yeah it feels more comfortable with that yeah because there is just so much that you can do with technical stuff you know is and it's also the same for like for dance like we speak about this like few times like in dance technique also it happens the same like even if you are the best dancer or hip-hop uh hip-hopper like if you just like do your tricks you have just such a certain amount of tricks after that if you are not building something that is not somehow effective or sensitive dramatic i guess somehow you you won't have you won't last [Music] because i think yeah because i think it's not about like effect so you're not trying to have effect on people that's what the magician will do that's the trick but i think what you would want to go is towards affect without the affection you want to really move to people yeah yeah well i wanted to say like uh like it's also like related to the message i sent you today that i started to think like i'm building you know like these sensors and we're doing projection and all these things but like dmx lights but it's not new you know everyone's doing it like a lot and why is it interesting i think it's because we constantly go back to light coding and like i said you know like coding lights or like with sensors or attached to light coding like sound for example and that's something new and that's where it becomes uh more complex and i don't know how it connects to affection but maybe it's just make it softer in some way i don't know i don't know if it's clear but yeah yeah no i mean a younger song but you're trying to say like yeah i mean yeah actually this is is about care you know you remember what daniella was saying that when she gave us this feedback you know this is about actually how you show care uh for the situation that you are in so in the case you guys are there and like you're taking care of the space like and you see like you're working so it's a similar yet different of practice of what we do uh in terms of like like i don't know what you guys are doing but i know you're busy you know like you're taking care like you're doing something you're doing something so yeah yeah true yeah that makes sense like you think you're you're affect you're affecting the conditions of how things happen and therefore also how i as an audience can a viewer see that i'm question i'm wondering now how would be that like in life that thing that should be very interesting to see live yeah i mean you have to come back yeah but i think it's definitely something like uh as you said like i think what it makes it cool is is this so you you have this trend of audiovisual performances by the way there is a there is an open there is a there is a uh something happening also that i will tell you after i forgot to say it in in behind before we started the chat um so you have this thing of the visual performances which very often becomes just somebody in front very flat with some images right um [Music] so as you said i think what is interesting is like although what you have the live coding is there very dominant or is this is it's a very important element you have all the materiality and all the not yeah maybe you have yeah it feels close to a performance than an audio visual performance yeah it feels more close to a performance yeah yeah yeah that's what i think sorry like there are clues with this like that's what i'm thinking that i would like to see you guys and then like then play also with the floor and see because i think this is like naturally kind of overlapping what we do um so even it's just naturally you know uh when i see some videos also what float is doing like things like we have the movement you know like with the approach or the way how we met was through movement right um and this is something that is a constant in us but there was something that like i don't know i saw a video like you guys did that floor was doing something like it was like something like i don't know what she was doing but it felt like it looked like so sensual or so uh performatic um also so it was like very yeah performative it is it looks very performative what you guys are doing i'm sorry thanks so sorry like just can can you did you still know what you were saying or you forgot no i mean it's just a rephrase like i just started to think that audio visual performance or like live coding but just like with projection and sound it's like it's it's really brutal right it's it's nothing about the space like you just like you know put the color put the sound and just you make something but it's also as you said it's not caring about the space which i never thought about that way i think the best example of that is maybe we should show that like is this guy rioku the guy who was there uh this guy he always what's up uh kru kawa uh i hope let me try to find it and show it because so this guy really working the audio visual thing and he's he's a monster in the way hockey like his things are so uh i mean i really like it aesthetically i think yeah but it's i think it's the clear example of what you're trying to say is so so so aggressive yeah um i know we can find it i'm not used to zoom anymore shear screen i just have to put let's just go to his website yeah i mean this explains all but do you have like do you have something like a video of him because like it is so this audio visual uh performances that you involved like audiovisual thing right so the audio is there also maybe this one well yeah this is yeah i i don't want to share it again so you know i maybe i just put link or something so people can watch it later but yeah lasers yep and lions i mean also like uh who's that um the famous guy very famous artist uh ikeda he's also very famous with you know black and white lines sine waves kind of stuff yeah so yeah i mean this is that's it's just this is going to what we just speaking like i mean i think what is cool from what you guys are doing is that yeah it's very different but but at the same time then it's like then you will have problems like because then it's not it it's just go goes it i think it could easily go in in a similar aspect that how what happened with their practice then it doesn't respond to an ecology of a market you know um like you have public to see this that just be so you know there is audience for that right [Music] yeah i mean um i have to be careful with wording but i think that's also something maybe floor might you know have to struggle because i know why she's good and that's like we're working together but also uh yeah like people might not understand why she's good or how good she is because it's something not doesn't fit to anything [Music] and you know well we'll see but i don't know it's great i think i think it's great like and to be like the the time that i have been here like in motionbank i feel like this has been so good and [Music] because it also forces me to um to come be more concrete and to basically like to to uh to be forced to be practical in different ways in order to share meta ideas or things that i will understand other you by andersen [Music] yeah yeah yeah i have been using a lot lately this there is this book called chronographic figures uh deviations from the line so it is something that florian suggested to me [Music] and then so what what is is interesting from the book is that it's basically it's like a long project i think it's like three or more than three years project between uh people from different practices one of them is like somebody that from pub that i know christine she was a dancer for a long time of uh alan platel and palestine and basically so it goes in a really depth like a uh really really maybe uh yeah really in-depth art research so like really really in this meta world uh really deep into their own constraints and creating their own world um but then they for instance like they talk about uh annotating um or something there is this one of the person is this is somebody is i think you say her name is emma crook and i think she's knowing the graphic world for doing like you week's design or something um so basically i think the whole thing goes like that it goes up it's about practices right so then you have practices of attention notation conversation and witnessing and then you have figures and and each figure somehow represents like uh our approach to movement whole hope the actions start to rise so i think the first thing is about um clearing and emptying out somehow is you know like to get into the space or something like that and just clearing out a spiral momentum i guess after you clear then you spiral and get momentum temporarily closing i guess it speaks for it itself like then you close um yeah and then other things so what i found interesting from this is that um because they have the drawing constantly they have the drawing and in in in in the practice and then i'm working with drawing on the on the br um i i can make the translation in my head like how to put it into something that is practical um [Music] because they're i mean their drawings are like yeah i can i cannot use these things you know these are there this is part of a chronographic practice so it goes really deep into into i think this is close of what you guys are doing you know like because these people work with materials um and you guys are working a lot now with materials so it's how can you right how can you transfer like gesture and um like wait let's share i will share something that like it was part of what i grew today but i think it's practical for public speaking i think so i think this idea of state and gesture is something that is coming often i see and what i'm doing and other things around me so then the oxford dictionary defines that state is a particular condition that someone or something is in as a specific time or a physical condition as regard internal or molecular form or structure or an agitated or anxious condition right uh or i love this one a dirty or untidy condition okay [Music] and then then it defines gesture as a movement of part of the body especially a hand or the head that express an idea or meaning an action performer to convey a feeling or intention so one can think somehow the gesture is close to the art domain and then the state somehow will be close to the tech domain um and something was super cool is to see like it i kind of stuck in a share right now but it is that there are some graphics that shows that actually the word state is being used drastically less from 2019 like really down and it happens the opposite with the gesture gestures from 2019 it goes really high in use and i thought that was very interesting to see how is this use of these words are now being more like for instance i'm used to like gesture somehow it's something that you hear very often in performing arts because gesture is close to is a verb it's an action it's close to is something that happens is a verb but the state is more close to the conditions of something in certain moment so he's not a verb but it's interesting because i didn't read it uh i just read the first bullet point of the pdf he sent me that vlorian is that florian wrote no yeah yeah that's also very interesting yeah because the first thing was that we think we are recording image and sound when we are re no when we are really recording time so i thought it's opposite but wait yeah because he says we are recording image and sound but in fact we are recording time is that what he's trying to say okay yeah i super like i didn't finish salsa but i thought it was also super interesting so what i'm trying to think to share here is that this week i start as i say to introduce noise in what i'm doing i allow and it happens just naturally i think i didn't finish because yeah so i have this br thing and then the br if i if i'm not here if i look somewhere else i don't have my reference so i need to be dancing like this or something so then i thought okay i will just i i i create instances of my model and then i put it around me then if i move anywhere in the space then i have some visual reference then i am free and then condensed then i went uh further with this and then i put also uh instances above and under and then i remove the floor that i have um and that was so cool man that was so that was like because because then i finally i could use the floor again that is something that i like to do as dancer like to use the floor and before that i could not use that and something that was very cool and it just happened by chance is that the instance so it's like somehow aesthetically things are coming in but just in just in as a consequence of the function that i'm searching for so what i put different instances of my body in different places and then i i'm just doing my stuff and at some point i realized wait but this looks way different here than there because the position is different so it just looks all the patterns of my same triangle look so completely different are they like all facing the same direction all of them are facing the same direction yeah all of them are are the same instances so like they're like that's like a grid yeah yeah yeah exactly just using my yeah as a grid exactly i literally am using a grid positions to instance the other and then i so i start at my level and through 600 degrees and then i put i in the y position above and the y position under me i see um but so i was saying that because of what so i actually saw for instance because so i think i feel so that i started like disturbing and we we talked about i think this was the last time we talked in the chat was like that i want to distort like or to introduce some glitch or noise in the work uh but not yet back then but i think like now this was kind of it it happened just naturally this already came and i thought okay and then i started just being more relaxed with not only that but also the way who i take my my like the way how i work with this you know like i have all this setup like i have like a big setup here like it's a big studio so it's like i started thinking that how i can uh be close to actually what we do what we do at practice whole so it seems to me um that the borders between what i'm doing and what the computer is doing is getting more loose and that's the thing is so it then i come close to a place that i'm more familiar with this that's the place that basically we've developed together um so it's getting in that direction uh because i have somewhat a reliable system now i see and i sp and and i spend a lot a lot of time in every i mean i can it's an ongoing process like they're always constantly files that have to be moved and all but it's just part of the process so but anyway i have a reliable system so because of that then i can't deserve it only because of that yeah yeah yeah this is interesting like i think we're kind of going to the same direction in a way because i also have that here that we build stuff like i said you know with the projection and lights and stuff but it's not that we well like maybe during daytime i try to make things work calibrate stuff and the projection is there lights are controlled but then if we start to perform there's a session it doesn't matter anymore you know if it's not working if you move stuff projections off but it doesn't matter and then but you know that's like the practice that it becomes really interesting and and we can do it because we know that it's not gonna you know completely fail or like if i mean completely fail in terms of the technical sense that you know the computer won't catch fire or anything so even if the projection is off it's not the end of the world and it can be interesting too yeah and glitches like it can be i don't know what your system is like but you know if the tracking gets lost you know it can be also interesting right unless it completely stops yeah i do not have been really thinking of that what i'm thinking i think what to do for the next week is so like already i'm like this week i'm starting my my sessions like from the morning i installed i put on everything so before i was just taking some time like from nine to ten every day for four weeks i was coming and just being with lights off and just moving and taking time for me and then after that i would start doing things but this week i already started just come here and put it on and [Music] start yeah it's a similar process the one going with you in different ways for instance um but just you learning the process like no like uh but i think so like yesterday for instance i i i thought i want to do like to record a session by 10. there's a lot i need to i need to yeah i need to 20 minutes to make sure that i'm ready to record so i was pushing a bit too much for being so early so i could not expect that i would have uh an effective uh or yeah a sincere or that my body will be in this position to entangle with the machine if my body doesn't have the time to wake up because already i'm putting in the stress to to if what i was doing for one month is just every day taking one hour for myself and my body understood that and then all the study i'm saying like okay we have 20 minutes to make everything ready and then after that i should be ready to deliver it's just we when i put the vr goggles on i'm like what do you want for me it's like the body and the the there's there's just no there's no warm-up between the medium and the body it's just it's too much i think i don't know if it's related to what you said but what i'm trying to do is like to make things that are like well this sounds different but like material or like i was thinking about something more like air or water i'm not saying that i want to recreate nature or something but like you know if this tracking system working then it should be just there like it's not that technician has to turn it on and then you have someone has to look at it like and fix it every single time to make it working [Music] but it's just you know turn it on and vr system or tracking system or dnx lights it just should be like like working it doesn't have to be completely functional but somehow it does its own thing by itself for some amount of time not like every 10 minutes it fails and you have to go back to turn it on again but somehow it does something so we can create a playground with all these elements what you're saying is like somewhat then still then you need to have you need to trust somewhat that your system will be reliable somewhat yeah i think it's that's the tricky part that it's reliable in a sense that it can be let's say queer reliable it's not like reliable that it's like like perfect straight rigid if there's like something fails then it will turn on again kind of reliable but it has to be at least like doing something you know like always i come back to this idea that if something fails on the stage with this like technical thing the show must be go on you must go on right like if yeah but you can't say okay we started over no but then it's like because um if this show is um let's take for extra example of what you guys uh when when you were working in belgium in antwerp and you guys were working in this project that was uh uh using motion capture how it's called the project empty mind empty mind yeah um if the streaming will have been lost for 20 minutes over 10 minutes even or if like uh yeah if if the internet will damage for 20 minutes then it's a catastrophe that's it there was no show so because that performance so much that constraint so i think that's the word that i'm searching i guess depending of what are your constraints you can bet oh i mean you can be in the position of uh of losing something or not so in the example that you were saying if we are doing let's say a projection mapping or like motion tracking uh dance piece with public and then for some reason i mean i think this is a good example that my hand is controlling something right but already you as technician you know that you will give some control but you won't give uh you will take into account already as a developer that yeah that the control is just i mean the margin of error is certain so you won't expect to work towards uh something that is 100 exact and i don't know like no latency at all like you will take that already to the account right in the case that something gets lost then you know that you can afford to lose the system for a few seconds so i mean say i think going back could be interesting to speak from what you were saying about the queer i think i like that like reliable queer like if your system somehow is not um if there isn't a clear statement of what the system is actually what is the purpose of the system for instance if you're using lights to illuminate right a person an object and then there is a clear intention that everybody's understand in uh java public so we are talking here about communication right so you have a light and the light is lighting a personalized a character so the public will understand this message like you want people to see this character because maybe the character is going to speak um so you so if the light is gone uh then you have a pro it's yeah then it's a problem because the the funk the functionality of the light is to illuminate that character it's not queer you know it's it's very is that the it's defined right very rigid yeah i think if the light is it illuminates but maybe it's not the only one but there are other ones and um so you as an audience don't completely understand what is if he's not completely understandable is the purpose of these lights then it's fine if one of them failed it doesn't matter it doesn't change anything it might be even what i think is interesting i think it's close to the artistic composition is like then even you will start thinking that it's import it just opens so many possibilities for the audience to read if the light fails if it's if if intentionally is actually wired in certain way that if it it's actually becoming uh it is giving agency for glitch to happens and for generative work basically generative work yeah that's interesting well it's not opposite but generative always to me it sounds like something that is you know already scripted or like it's it follows some kind of rules to generate something but what you're saying is more like giving room to generate something to or more like emerge no but no i mean from what i understand i think general generative also it refers to systems that actually you don't know you basically then you use the system uh you have an understanding of the system and then you put it to work in certain ways to have different outcomes within so a random system basically uh yeah or like a black box more like well those are black books but you know like it's like a factory do you know what you would what do you know what you were doing like as a narrative when you were printing that's the narrative uh because basically just by the nature and so for other people also they're watching is not necessarily about technology because generative art has existence always it's just how you put in into place a system that allows a different outcome to happen right that we have no control in a way i mean as a no yeah but more or less you could but you could expect somehow like you you should i mean you could expect more or less i mean if you put uh a printer to print an image although then you are i guess moving the offset you know that is not going to come out a cheese but it's not going to be a crepe or a beer coming out it will be a paper with certain images so it will be you understand more or less how will be but then it's like what i think is interesting that i'm uh more interesting than to talk is then then then the glitch thing uh how did we came into like this conversation of generative and glitch like narrative i don't i don't see i don't see the error in the generative you know what i mean no that's why i was asking because i think you meant something that is like for example if something fails like lights fail then it gives room for people to understand in different ways right i mean that is not expected and they can become more rich and that's yeah in a way it's like a meta generative that yeah creates that interpretation but it's it's a different uh i mean i understand the point but i wouldn't call it generative and that's like why we started talking about this yeah okay you know i completely agree what you're saying most interesting perspective but it's more like a glitch yeah if if you use glitch actually you have to generate yeah it's true it could be confusing in that sense like is it the opposite truth but this this whole thing is also like a glitch in the meta level so yeah i don't know tell me about the no you know you said about the grid or like mirrored perspectives and what's what's with noise you're also like changing movements or within vr or like what you want to do with noise or glitch no no no i mean what i mean like that was more like conceptual like just something that i also realized is that when i work with music you know like when you work with music and then um i think they're like already i think there's two different things when you're annotating what are you trying to document something it's like you have like you can annotate from a singular point of view right so something that meaning that something that not necessarily needs to be shared but you understand what is it so i create my system or annotate and then i then is for me that's so i think a singular way of annotate or a more shareable let's say uh something that you know is is in order to for you to communicate the idea or to capture the moment or to capture the state or something so when i record in vr for instance and then i if i don't use play because i think i can use actually literally my text because it just spins before better than yeah so working with sound or without sound is quite different when recording a vr session without sound i feel attentive and aware of the space i consider and test my spatial constraints i will often check the virtual limits of my space and in general just move more into the whole space i feel vulnerable yet more explorative than a session with sound this is more clear when the sound is less experimental and more rhythmical with a song i will get in the mood and just dance music is performative when i see the recording this is also true as a witness audience i can experience a similar state than when this was recorded when the recording has no sound i can feel quite dull and out of the context yet neutral and less one-sided so for instance if you think in the example when i share this thing with you the last week you can almost have like these these gayness this this happiness on the on the on the on the doing uh on the graphic if you so i did also the same recording but without sound so i i did a second one after and then it's awesome foreign as i said it's just dull it's dull because i'm not so into that um yet it's more neutral so it doesn't mean that it's good or bad but it's a different thing yeah yeah yeah i see something to i don't know what to say maybe we close and then next time we can expand on it yes we will forget but uh yeah because sound is also something like with sensors and stuff and you guys are working with sauna also oh yeah yeah yeah this is something like you guys are also working with sound but like last time it was yeah like i think we are kind of going back and forth with like what like rhythmical sound and more like an ambient sound and i think this is something we have to we have to explore more and i want to like connect to the sensors so like not an instrument but you just like you know touch something or like move something and make sound i think it becomes more performative but i also don't want to be you know making instruments because then when you make an instrument you have to master the instrument and that's like a bit different to me no but no no i don't agree with you because then i think that you can make the instrument and then uh i think what i i could see is like in us in a in a setup that the like the one that you guys are working there's so many other things that yeah i mean just i guess you just have to have common sense that if it's something that is just doing some weird noise and you don't control completely then just don't use it too high but you know but for the rest um i think since you are more in an explorative place i think um you should just explore yeah yeah one of the things that i read also from this book that i mean i see it like the inner practice we have done so many of the propositions that they did here but we did it just by i don't know it just came naturally like for instance like one of the things that they they talk is about timing so even though they are really crazy in what they do and what what so so not they say like to define a time frame it was very important and i also define a time frame where to talk or when to give some signals i mean like often when i read then i see like uh there are so many similarities and things that we have developed um that's so what i'm trying to say from here is like i don't know how you guys are working with floor but the way my experience with you i think that we developed so much agreements like silence agreements that now that i'm reading i'm like wow but basically we just agree so many times in these these and these um like implicit implicit that exactly that that's why it became so difficult to share with somebody else because there was so much respect uh that basically we didn't have to care because we respect so much right so yeah anyway yeah so but anyway so i'm taking this but some things from this book that uh out that i i will take for sure with me and to try with you guys um oh yeah that would be super cool exciting yes okay so somebody just closed thank you for watching and uh yeah please like the video subscribe to the channel i haven't seen it oh i i say it once in a while so uh thank you for watching", "1WqfGzpY7Ds": "hey recording hello hopefully no network disruption this time yeah it will happen over and over this this what we have to be catching is like when is frozen the image because they just you know it like we keep on going speaking and we don't realize until oh i lost you exactly but for me it's okay if wait no either way it's not good but if you're frozen i can just improvise because of the recording because it's recording on my end yeah but yeah exactly so you can if so it's okay if i if i if i'm froze while you're speaking if you're frozen well i'm speak but still i have to say it again after to continue the conversation anyways it's fine we'll see my exhibition in japan which is kind of a big thing for me i saw it yeah it's like it's kind of it's a physical big thing it's a big thing yes it's physically big thing 12 meter wide too bad i don't know i i had the feeling and i don't know if it's because because it's like i'm not printed but it could be coming from there but i was thinking that somehow it feel like uh it's loose it loses something a little bit i think through if too i don't know if you feel the same but but i was reflecting because you sent me this image i saw this morning and i was thinking i don't know it could become from like oh i'm not there which but also was reflecting that it loses could be maybe it could be because it's just like just like it's kind of close to this image that i have of the artist showing what can the artists do you know like in a way politically you're you're more safe when we are together but i don't know how you see what i mean because then yeah it's politically without going too deep in that like politically it's easy just to break with me but at the same time i'm thinking i mean yeah that could go in a really political discussion of like yeah yeah totally because this is like of course uh like i'm happy about it generally but also to get there as a lot of well we didn't discuss much about it but uh for me i have to reflect a lot and of course i have to justify is it fine that i'm doing this basically because in a way i'm hijacking the practice to put it as a as my work which is you know not it's not cool but then i also had thoughts around like for example i'm using hydra for example i'm doing other kind of practice with floor that i used like some ideas came from that and then also with you know frozen okay back on your back yes uh and of course you know the practice we do and yeah i i wasn't sure i actually i have to say i made another version that i didn't print but i did recording with like different images from practices or like some things i did with flora like i put some stuff in the background that uh and i was moving in front of it and but it didn't really like it it's different from how we do as a practice like yeah no but but i think i think that because this is like is a complicated thing that we are kind of discussing here which is like involved like personal things but also like the artist as a subject uh like the artist and then media art like there are different topics that you can really go with deep and i don't think um i don't i i understand all of this but somehow i feel that they are connected one thing that i can say like from my side but i think is that the the if you mean that that is fine whatever i mean i will you will be in your position i won't feel bad because it's coming from my practice as an artist so whatever you decide it all these things intersect you know like the work you do with floor the work you do with other work you do with me is intersecting so imagine that you cannot imagine that you have to live as an island from your practice from your artistic practice if you if for some reason uh this this work that you are developing as an artist crosses that has these intersections like now you're good floor and it's good because that's why i talked with her i like it so it's um it's fine you know so like in a personal level you know like in terms of like uh but it will say like copyrights of this kind of authorship kind of thing i would say like from my side like i was like i trust your decision so whatever it's fine um but so what i think is to mention this but how i bring it like somehow i felt then it's like it feels like the easily you can be more criticizable like or i could criticize you more yeah objectively i think um because like just the dimensions you know you have this dimension when you see your face there for instance so it's like it's such a statement like to be like that like they're the aesthetics i think that it changed completely the the the i think it's easier when you when you are with somebody else that in my that case me i think that stating somehow that is not such a it's not such a it doesn't feel like i am here looking like this this format but it's more like we are doing some weird stuff yeah even though i have control of like how you i layer on top of you and stuff like that but it's like it's a do it in any ways and because i think like you can give but again i'm saying i'm speaking from my side so i don't know how objective can i be with this that the way how i feel trying to be objective is that i could see you portraying you while i see if you worked or something that is like practice based something like that you are not and actually i experienced that when i was doing my solo in node i remember the ones i did like one for myself and then i thought like this feel um shortened i'm shortened by myself with my own aesthetic decisions um so although in the process of deciding which image because it's not real time you know it's not a practice this is this is a completely different process that you went through to print something like that so it's something that you're consciously deciding and overlaying but you're saying deciding what you want to see and i think yeah it seems to me that but yeah that you get you are more like in the fir in the first plane but and that could be also fine you know like for if you have a reason if there is a reason why you have to see your but why i was thinking also that that could be something else it's i mean kind of like the analogy when we talk about like artists they use gold for instance as that as their statement no is there is there a statement is to use gold in such a way so it could be also that this is just you use that medium to uh to create yourself like a disgusting gosilla coxilla thing you know like this massive image of you could be you know what it could be but then but then but then it has to be a purpose i think somehow because i mean i'm saying what i'm saying like if you decide to go in some direction like this i think you should have somehow more consciousness of the people will criticize you i think or like there is a political um tangent that people can somehow go there while when you are first with me in the case of the practices is i don't think that aesthetically is better of worse because it's very similar aesthetically but politically speaking there is not too much to to jump on this when we are doing together yeah but like could be maybe if there will be two white guys for instance you know if there are two white guys perhaps because somehow like we we were saying this with you now and stuff like we are in a i think in a privileged place of intermediarity of being queer so to be not the the white male um yeah yeah um not trying to avoid what you said but uh like also what you said just before about so it's not a practice but i was making it towards printing let's say and that was really different process like you know i tried to follow the protocol of the practice but i didn't set one hour for example and i record something and then i look at look back what i did i did the same thing like record with obs and take a screenshot and then i'm not satisfied so usually after the practice i wouldn't do another practice but i would just record it again and take a screenshot from that video and i was not happy so i did like twice or three times and then finally i chose that image but that's already like a lot of rehearsing which is different from by the way so can you repeat again so then you basically did you use so you practice right you said you were practicing i did it by myself like recording a video and then i did it for one hour no i didn't decide but in the end it was it took more than one hour each time that you practice no no no no like in total like let's say 30 minutes and then i do yeah you know that i think i think this gives space for something that i was thinking i was in the place that i am right now is that i think like in a way i think we need each other in the sense of and the practice because it's in real time and there's so many happening that we don't have time to to think right so for instance the place that i am and when you have tools or there's so many resources like i was checking like just today i was in the motion bank man they have some some books and stuff like some documentation like there's very very very into the point of things that that we talk and but then then i mean then easily i can just go get lost into into this you know like um so what i'm trying to say to is that um yeah the process i guess of kind of conscious of like this yeah decision making i think is that like decision making is just hard and yeah there's too many things differently you know too much equipment too much time that you can easily get stuck in you know just debugging something mm-hmm because it's for home yeah i wanted to know like how is it how is it going with you guys so what is happening yeah do you think is last classes or something like that so the last week was uh let's say the first week of like actually working well working or like research and basically we just decided to work with some physical stuff like uh yeah mostly with the plotter pen plotter and so it's not like you know that moves like this like pen moves in 2d space but that one is a bit different so that it's it's being designed for drawing like for art well it's it's more like uh like vinyl cutter you know like there's like stickers yeah yeah exactly like feeder and then the paper moves and then the the pen moves only in one direction so it combines these two axes to so depends and the paper moves in white axes exactly and with the combination either you can cut cut the paper vinyl cloth or you can draw something with a pen did you do this by yourself or do you receive some workshop or did you ask some help for that uh the technician was uh so basically the other fellow from the last time like the last round they bought this plotter through the academy and then so the technicians know how to use it so i just set it up with one of the technicians i mean mostly i he just told me like which software i need and then there's like open source version that i installed with uh inkscape plug-in and then it just works well i need to adjust some parameters but okay yeah i kind of started going technical questions like oh yeah is this like a vector well wait a minute yes yeah like you know illustrator is like vector based right like yeah yeah okay but i think what is interesting is i was thinking is so yes what you guys were doing that uh and but that's not a class that was just like you're cur you were curious and you asked some help and start just playing with that yeah and it's also you know the idea of the fellowship is not to produce something but it's more about research so it's kind of valid to just explore with plotter but you know it's it's very tricky there is this concept like which i think is not really i think it should be old but it's just now it's resonating in this idea of performing what is what performing a process i think there is even a book of that and i think in the state of the art of contemporary art instead of the art of contemporary dance i think that's where they are you know like the the extreme of this the extreme of this is uh i don't think they are the extreme you know they are maybe too much because they they are so they are like living in this near banner that they don't really care at all of the shape of if somebody like it or they understand or not they are i think really at the other side of that um i think i separate myself from contemporary dance at the point when i start i think it was from 2017 i think 16 when i started like i was part of i guess all these contemporary dance things and then i started just trying to work toward design and trying to communicate with design to a more wider audience that was my purpose of working with design and not be so self-referential and other things and so but now now i see uh them coming back to do these things like this are coming back to me you know um and then then i was thinking oh okay so uh i mean what i'm trying to say like i think i was trying to mix with something before is that what is the what is the threshold you know what is the threshold where if you are performing a process or if you're interested in performing for instance like i'm i'm in a space that i'm i'm challenging myself because this is how is somehow is within a design context so i'm challenging myself to still stick to something that it has a purpose somehow so somehow that is functional but at the same time i'm trying to open you know to open up also a lot uh the conversation that i have with you the last time was the last sunday was was helping me also to to slowly to open up it doesn't mean that i cannot keep my focus also but then to open up and then i was thinking that what is the threshold where i where's the threshold where something is in a way like interesting or not you know for that's very tricky because as soon as i hear that i think that threshold the notion of threshold is coming from a design perspective right yeah yeah yeah absolutely yeah and i understand yeah so it's very biased in that sense that you are already judging from i'm not saying it's good or bad but like invalid like yeah evaluating from the design perspective if this is interesting or not yeah yeah absolutely and stressful yeah yeah because this is actually it's actually is from a functional point of view that i'm just trying to see is this gonna work for these people or not yeah and that's that's the sign yeah yeah true but then also like i don't know like now i or maybe because we worked on the installation at dan's house earlier i really feel like i really value the design part like it's just like a personal thing that like also when i started with flora i feel like you know okay we have to make something that is meaningful like whatever we make fun of to have fun exploring different material different uh expression if it doesn't you know if no one can understand then there's there's no point so we have to if we're working in a theater then theater people should understand somehow it shouldn't be anything geeky but that's very design perspective of understanding the audience the user but this is this is interesting i mean i was talking with florian last friday so um then i uh by the way like so i am the updating this i'm doing this weekly report so then i put it in the link that you know so the second week and then um then i was so this idea that of the mover user is coming back now and my oh what i'm doing i want my user is a mover right and that's something that um i haven't if you if you're checking my notes they're not finished yet by the way okay i'm glad i'm gonna check it right uh like it's gonna be finished tomorrow um but yeah so this idea of the in my documentation i'm like so this idea of the mover user and also the audience user are are there in in in something that i want to write or that i want to to understand a little bit better and right uh and this is i'm saying this because of the installation that was out of the audience user right yeah and it was in that case it was very clear because we kind of understand well we kind of guessed who would come and that's really you know [Music] make a really like dance audience and not really take people coming to see that installation because it was the theater that's theater venue [Music] but we prototyped even like people that even in that case we even we create personas like we prototype case of use of that yeah but one was like a dancer and also even the tech guy was also he knows he has dance background for example did we yeah i think we didn't even think about someone who's interested in digital digital art and doesn't know [Music] much about dance i don't know but anyways um but that process was really good because i really framed what we not what we want but who we want to show the installation to and i don't know what is your case is it like with the is it like with dance academy or like what is what would be the what target audience if you're a part of the visualization [Applause] anybody who wants to move like mover i will say a mover but it doesn't have to be a dancer it's a mover um but then also reflection with claudia and he was saying for instance that that i need to get rid of the of my of the developer like of the whole developer while i'm when i'm performing uh because it's true like for instance something i realize this week is like because it's so expensive to create this motion capture then when i'm going to when i'm to record i have this pressure of being effective of what i'm doing like i want my data to be useful for something um and i think that's not helping too much but also difficult to not get there even though and this is very interesting because for instance like i know so i'm the technician and also i'm the artist i'm there right so as a technician like i know that that's gonna take certain time to to be running um but then uh also then i get impatient as a dancer when i have to perform what i'm doing that process and then when i have to perform is i feel super it feels like another not organic because i feel like now i have to perform and it's like out of the sudden i'm not ready to perform so then i'm trying to use the morning sessions that i do from nine to ten which are great at the same time yeah i think i think the last time i was doing something like that could be more than five years six years like to every day to move for one hour and this is great my body is like you feel like in a party you know like it's very interesting how every every every day is like wow dude this is like doing some slowly some things uh also with my age that i can recognize i don't have my knees that i have five years ago like things like that for instance um [Music] so when i finish first in this session of the dancing thing i feel now would be great to do a motion capture i have this feeling on the thursday then i thought maybe the system should be ready for this and then i've kind of like spent a little bit of time like doing that and then it's like already was like five minutes so i'm completely in a different state of mind i'm not in the dancer and then you're because you're setting up the motion capture yeah because like i'm with this flow i'm in the flow of dancing and i'm like oh wow now i can record this because now it is the moment and i said okay let's try and just do it faster and then i'm trying to do things fast in a really simple way then when i realize it's like five minutes doing all the setting and i'm still not i mean less than 50 of the process start recording so i'm like no it this is just not the space you know it's like it's it's me but it's like between this like duality of the dance or the dancer or like the somatic experience of myself on my brain experience that is like no dude like don't be like that let me finish when i you know like let me finish i'm doing the nice thing and then we can start doing what you want so it's it's it's a bit tricky this um this thing um but what i was saying yes so if florian was saying that gifts from i said i was talking with him of this and he said like you need to find a way how to just get rid of this developer thing you know like the uh and then he suggests like why don't you uh like then record yourself and then record the vr and then annotate that and then i thought like okay like it's like i mean the first thing i thought is like i don't want to spend time in learning how to use the tool uh to to learn this thing but then after i mean it's slowly i guess this i start doing some timeline also like i guess i will use this i don't know if i will use the tools but again what i'm trying to do is like i need to annotate i need to repeat that's one of the things that i found in this book that i told you that that i they have here is very it's very interesting like it's just like short essays of like i think everything that they have done so far i think um so but so no motion bank but just their tools applied in different contexts and then some academics grow like two three pages reports of what they find so it's very to the point of does it work works it's not working it's really straightforward but in part of the editorial then with uh the david uh written house on scott de la hunter then and rebecca something that i don't know her last name then they they grow there's something that they say like that there is so much about like seeing material over and over and over that there are things that appear when you watch material many times um and that's something that is this week slowly started thinking that okay because i thought for reason like with one developer that he created these visualizations of uh you know his name is uh christian yeah i think i know him now so he was the one who created this in three three years uh for spaghetti yes so editing so and then i was trying to talk with him like the first week and then one of the things that i remember that i was trying to get more conceptual things you know i think he's very he's very practical he's a developer so but the only thing he was saying is like i saw these things like i can tell you more than 50 times the whole piece which is one hour he was saying i saw that like and tell you more than 50 times one hour uh and i was trying to get just conceptual thing you know kim i was trying why you took these decisions or not and he said it was somehow more like an inorganic process but it comes basically because he just repeat that over and over and over and over so it becomes like a a similar process that what i guess a pianist or like some yeah like a it just becomes something automatic i think um yeah so yeah this is the i'm thinking that i i think i want to start analyzing somehow what happens but then yeah but then finally also the threshold the thing is as an artist and we are not used too much to analyze we do our like tools let's say annotate what we do but we just we we build things right so uh yeah so this is something like something you're like thinking also i don't want to spend it just feels to me i don't want to spend like super i don't know a lot of time like in 10 seconds of [Music] vr you know it's just it's just for me it seems to the constraints like very slowly i start opening like i just don't want to see like oh i don't want to go and then start writing over and over i mean for something that is just 10 seconds or one minute uh on movement in vr because for me somehow it stays still technical but it's because i think there is more reasons that are not just technical but i think there are there is i slowly started seeing in text with the grow up right and when i talk also with florian like although this is very technical there is a lot of reason of of a lot of unveiling of the dance or the piece or new actually new forms of uh like a transformation of this piece like one of the things like the scott give me in in a remark on the text one about the my bachelor proof he was saying that when i said about the archiving process then i mentioned that the text is a document of the past and then uh he says that he said like a document can be imprisoned can represent pet presence and can change in present uh like the the the fact that you are with the paper and with us with a stillo is this is not different from the dance that that space of being with a computer writing a text or you just in this thing i think i showed you the last time also it's like drawing hypotheses in the first chapter the person speaks also a bit of about diagrams and in short like what they said is that like yeah the the moment basically um so they see this as a choreographic thing so this the act of writing or to create a diagram or to create a drawing as a choreographic income interesting okay it's a bit choppy but maybe i say something from different perspective because we've been exploring a lot with uh pembrotter and that's really you know it's it's working with a pen and it's just a matter of like the motors like controlling the motors like with one axis and another axis and you can actually hear you know it's like 3d printer like i don't know you so like you hear sound from 3d printer right it makes like a weird funny noise because it moves in a very um periodic but also you know like in a way that the movement uh creates you know very specific kind of sound um so it's it's like choreography um also like in a way it's on the installation but also it's drawing in real time and that's i don't know i'm just saying because it kind of you know relates to like i was thinking about this from my perspective of working in flutter and then you're saying about this from archiving uh and writing process and yeah i don't know how to expand yeah nobody it reminds me when you were doing these printings like like with the printings that you were doing when you have the it's like a slight offset i mean that when you print over and over again the the nuts really will just the printing will look different because it's just the way how physically will create a print yeah yeah yeah i i liked that work i did because so with the offset it's always different i haven't gave you this one but i have it i brought it of course uh here and out here well this is not the one we talked we just talked about but you know uh and this and there's another um batch of work i did with like bunch of lines that align in different ways and that's really like i think it's for me it's good uh example of hacking the medium because it's normally what you don't want the offset you don't want the offset but i made i made use of the glitch or the [Music] the error which the imperfection of the material and then we're like i also talked with flora with about the how can we make this plotter interesting with his glitch one thing we tried is actually to you know pull the paper while it's drawing so you so you you so like that you guys are pulling that while it's doing i mean it happened accidentally you know because of some uh alignment was off and it happened it was interesting but then i don't know we didn't really go we didn't really go far with that idea yet it's it's very simple but it doesn't really i feel it needs another extra step to make it interesting like if i really want to make something like this offset print it's just it's still a bit too [Music] rough or raw yeah because in this in this process i mean what in what you're saying here i think that what it makes it interesting is is this is the series element you know like if you will bring just one it just doesn't say too much i think maybe that could be close of what happened in in the exposition of japan for instance like if you could have the opportunity to have like 10 of those banners for instance uh then then you have a series right um [Music] so i think the in the example that you're speaking i think it works especially especially the one who is glitching uh because it's configured is uh you made it for for that somehow so it's like not not or figures of a body but it's just some glitchy patterns and so i think yeah when it's a series like i think you're working towards a series um could be and i think that another kind of meta idea would be to do it with hand but then you know serious i i mean to be honest i think like you have a [Music] there is something interesting that you are developing with this analog stuff but then you need to define what is that but you do you're going somewhere with this analog stuff like it could be uh yeah it's like um yeah i think so it would be interesting to think about you know like what if instead of plotter someone has to follow the instruction and draw something but then it becomes like a fluxus piece already this is like the pathfinder yeah it could be but this this pathfinder we spoke we spoke last week on friday and then i think i think what is where the beauty of this thing is there is not really smart you know the thing is not not smart but it's just something that is there and then it actually gives is still the user can it is up to the user how to interact with this so it's very is very primitive it's very primitive but because of its primitive it it works so well that you can put it you can put that in different examples like if you could see that in vr for instance also like it's just the the the the idea behind so primitive that it works really well because it's very simple yeah but then how okay so after this coming back to what you were saying about like writing as uh what what's the what's how did you say it like it's present in the present moment that you write or like what were you saying yeah yeah but isn't that regarded i think that wait and then i just said specifically what he says um oh no man i don't find it anyway i think it's in that direction that when you are writing is i i mean i said this is a doctor this is a document why one something about the past what he says is something in the present so it still is it's in the present so you can change it i mean it's just something it's not ended it's like a performance though it's not ended it's a it's a real it's a momentary thing it will happen only the moment you're doing that you're writing [Music] toes it's up to you what you do when you're writing you see but that's like um also because he's writing all the time no it's not like i have i captured something and i have to describe something write it down but it's more like you know just dumping his brain into text all the time you know it's just like it's just like you're breathing you have to write and then it's just happened at this moment but it's not that you are it yeah it's i don't know if it's right but it's not about describing something that i saw at the moment and i write it down but it's more about writing is just happening at this moment i i think i think like it's not a simple i think it's complicated to really grasp it to be honest because you need to have the practice of that as a practice right so then for instance like i think this wednesday uh david will david written house will come and it's funny because like he's the only one that i haven't spoke like i mean i have so far interesting from my conversations from motion bank with scott de la junta with florian and with anton each of them they have so a completely different world and it's so so rich every time when i talk with them and like absorbing like also because i'm referring to so many things from dance that like go back into my dance thing um but also in context so it's very interesting but with david i didn't have the chance to talk to talk with him in berlin and and and yeah he said the other person that uh he's the one who's writing the applications i think here and he's the one with here for many years right already yeah since the beginning yeah he's the he started here like he florian told me he's the first together with anthem were the first people that florian hired because the project was started by the project was started by scott so and scott was that actually he was the lead manager of the forsythers project so it's called this code de la junta was the lead of that project of motion man so when they finish the project and within the project they hire florian and and then when we finish the project then scott and florian were like okay there's so much here let's just go on and then afterwards then then florian then hire anton and david and from there they start so just to go make sure and if anyone's watching just to explain uh so motionbank started as a kind of part of foresight company as a research project under prosite company and then as you said because they want the project is over but they want to keep going they found another house another home at the corso remains and they moved there now they are based in mines with a slightly new team yeah uh yeah but i think they passed like through frankfurt first so they told me that the friend told me also they have their not dodged years but like they kind of like really went for like project to project to project kind of like jumping through the projects and now florian was saying the last week now he seems like they're starting like big projects to to set um and somehow that they kind of like see like in the future that they would like to be independent as an institution and not being within the whole school because that comes with things yeah and when they were traveling i think that's when i met them like basically they were running ccl choreographic coding labs like everywhere in the world that was that was the time where they were trying that's what he was saying like that was like that like the time when they were trying going project per per project like just yeah and we're saying like i will grow and write the code on the on the on the airport it's like in new york yeah yeah yeah so it's i think it's quite different vibe than who is now [Music] um but wait so go back to this is that so they have different experiences practices yeah so that so then it's today be the thing i would like to talk with him with this wednesday so one of the feedback for us in the florida said to me when i showed it to me what i did this week and actually i showed him the gra basically the the writing of the last week because we could just talk on friday but during this week there are many things that happen so i just told him like just bear with me because this is i so at the end i think i will have some journal that i can put it in medium on motion banks medium as an article or something so he was happy with that and then he was saying that uh so he gave me this feedback of the uh is one of the things he was saying is that to make sure that somehow like that i use the time that i'm here which is it was like it makes me think that so i want to have this balance between like programming so developing programming coding uh making something uh [Music] writing and seeing things basically like uh resources but then what i'm uh somehow i'm reflecting from this conversation with him is like there are some things that i can do when i'm not here right uh like i can see some resources and i can maybe finish my writing while i'm not here but it is i have to make sure that i spend the time and that doesn't mean necessarily like only technical resources let's say the motion capture system but also the physical like the human resources you know that i take advantage of the conversation and could have with david uh with anton with florian like talk with florence it's very difficult because he's very busy for instance so um and this is something that i was not that that i didn't thought like uh until now like okay because i was thinking so far the last week that i will use also part of the timing to really grind and trying to write in almost academic way so like force myself like to the writing thing which i still will do but i think i will not be so harsh on me uh i still will try to great like writing like uh like the one that i share with you this somehow not notes but that somebody can read it that's what i'm doing in this thing because i have my notes um but i think i won't spend that much time cleaning those uh this shareable documentation uh i'll do it later i will do that i can do that later exactly and then i can also pass at some point i think i will start sharing that also with scott and with david and like for just feedback and like normal writing um [Music] but while i'm here i think i should use with space and also the people that that i can make use of my time here because if i spend it alone writing it's just like not too much yeah that's yeah i mean it makes sense and it's also about efficiency good or bad how efficiency well to effect effectively use time being in mind wow by the way like quotation mark so this weekend i thought okay it i need to do something in the cd like not only work so slowly i also start finding time for myself and then i realized that in in the city i didn't know it was like the the first press was here the gutenberg press was here and then i checked like that's why apparently the hog school is like rank among the fifth in the whole world so they have all this i guess the tradition with typography and design and stuff like that because it's weird because they call it communication in german lack of this graphic design i found it's bit strange they call it communications one anyway and also so that i saw that they have this there is a church of the chagall i put the you know this glass with colors that you see in church exchange class yeah i don't know where it's called so there exists one church here that is like oh all the glass from the church are made from mark chagall and i was there on saturday and it's like man it's bonkers because i and i was not in the sunny time so it's like blue and then at some point with some special things it's very weird because like an art is an art installation and this massive church and then you are just it seems like it's very it's very odd because it's a massive art installation in the church because it's not normal the colors is yeah it's it's blue so when i was there the feeling was dark blue you feel like down that's very strong interesting yeah it seems like uh maybe german people are obsessed with like making [Music] class art installation in the in the church yeah also yeah because uh also in the um cathedral in cologne i already have this uh list of insta there's a window from gerhart vista uh it's hard to show but it's basically pixelated oscillated on the chapel yeah it's a big cathedral and so they have these pixels on the chapel and people have they still go on to the church to the the service like yeah it's i mean i don't know during this time it's open now but normally it's open yeah wow yeah so i have to see that one in cologne next time i go there yeah that's super nice it's like wow this is this is the nicest i mean this is like the way i guess art should be more like that no like it's something normal but also if you want to experience as a oh wow then you can stay and have the oh wow thing yeah i'm just wondering like if this can be a window at some point it could be i was thinking an empath oh wow maybe i'm sure i'm sure like if if we have the means that actually that could be if we have the means could be interesting to propose to and i know like the person who is living with class uh she's uh i'm she's working with glass apart and she i mean she should be one of the there's not too much people working with glass this is kind of like an old position so she the person who lived with class lee worked with glass a person will work live with class work with glass and maybe she can she can make a practice a practice glass that we can put in the chapel of chapel that would be so funny yeah maybe you could also like make a wooden sculpture or something i don't know with a cross why i don't know so what is so what is like uh do you guys are you guys planning to work in something specific this week what is your plan how is it going i guess we talk about it tomorrow but i think for at the moment i think it's interesting to try different things every let's say every week maybe next week's class i don't know maybe it's too early for glass but uh oh cool no but yeah that seems nice so then just testing some new materials basically and then at some point i guess start thinking what are we gonna do from the from all this like passing from different approach like physical approach yeah i mean that could be one approach i mean it's coming from you know like we're just like making bunch of websites so [Music] it's it's kind of the same thing we just create a lot of things it was on the web but it can be again on the web but it can be printed plotted paper and then 3d prints i don't know what else but [Music] then we just like you know have a pile of things and we could decide if we try to show something curated in the end or it just say that you know like we did with websites we just have five of things and that's that's that i was thinking that other one that maybe could be useful if we think like what are the things that can be transferred from one medium to the other one which is this is not that's a good question or like there's a big question now if you yeah like from the mediums how you transfer things from one medium to the other one when you work with glass how you or you work with the plotter how kind of like for instance if you work with the plotter then you transfer the pixels to the plotter right but then how i guess from the plotter also you can transfer something back to the original medium something yeah i mean actually i'm reusing the processing sketch for converting image to uh oscilloscope signals because how oscilloscope works is it can only draw lines it's like vector and someone made a program to feed image and then you know make outline of it within processing opencv and then generate signals for oscilloscope and then instead of generating signals you could just simply get the vectorized outline and feed it into plotter and you could do the same thing instead of showing an oscilloscope i think i didn't understood it anything that you said wait so you said like the oscilloscope normally will just do this right yeah but you can also draw like 2d lines yeah if you feed two signals in like normally it's like with time on one axis but you could use another signal to so one signal is for x and one sigma is y just like drawing in how to say yeah like you can draw like x like 2d lines but they're all only lines it's like a plotter basically yeah so that's what yeah i saw like yeah i saw floor post one thing so because it's x and y like plotter you could also use that data for the plotter instead of drawing those lines on the oscilloscope you can move the pen to draw it of course it's much slower on the plotter but it could do the same thing interesting but of course how like what kind of outline like what kind of threshold would be interesting on oscilloscope and what kind of you know parameters would be interesting for plotter they're different right like because it visually it's different so yeah you have to find different parameters yeah yeah yeah we yeah if you try just to put right straight forward the same position from the oscilloscope into the plotter it might be not so interesting it's just it's a representation of the oscilloscope that could be more interesting to to still allow the plotter to do his thing you know do what a plotter normally do still with that information on the other hand plotter can be you know like huge paper piece of paper uh but it's static like you draw once and that's it but with oscilloscope you can change the image just like a video yeah like in real time you could you can do something in real time so they're like different stuff yeah because the image is not so the image is something that is like easily i mean you can perceive the image as something that is it alters very fast and but uh if it's something physical like writing is not so yeah it's not the same it's not the same feeling changing it doesn't change that fast like an image you can change an image very fast completely but the physical uh printing is you cannot change it so fast maybe you should get laser like the controllable one that you can like basically like oscilloscope like you can you feed the signal and you can move the laser in 2d um but can you can you do you have a laser to draw do we have one uh i don't know otherwise we have to order one if you don't have because i guess you can use like you can use laser cutters but and then just and then instead of a paper then you just you use wood and then just you engrave in the wooden yeah that's also possible or a 3d printer it could be possible 3d printer will be slower now yeah but what i was thinking about laser is like a like a laser projection for the gas like showing image on the wall with laser oh you remember i know you didn't yeah when there's electronica there was one people they were they were doing something with the laser on the wall and they were creating some they were there was this thing that was moving but because of the motion it was creating some different patterns yeah yeah i don't know that but i've seen performances by robert henke he uses like state-of-the-art fast laser then you can draw images and have like a huge wall with audio visual performance oh man and if you if you order something that the equipment has to stay there right yeah that's why the plotter is there from the other fellow maybe you guys should order like a badass laser then i can use one after one one year oh there is there are lasers there i need to check i i haven't seen them but uh maybe otherwise we have to order that could be cool yeah why not i didn't think about it it's kind of funny it's like a natural you know progression from oscilloscope because it's just like same principle and beer and what i think also there is i think that it can work is that i mean at the end if you so this is a this is a point you know a point is the minimal expression a point actually is even something that you can it doesn't mean anything like in for example designer a point cannot be represented because you you need to put a substance in the point a point needs to be at least a line the distance between two points a line is the minimum distance between two points but a point is just a reference uh the point is just a reference is so if you think in a pen it's it's a reference until it collapses the plane and kandinsky speak about that like the point i'm playing is about that the point is nothing or it's just a reference until it collapses on this encounter with a paper at that moment becomes something so i was thinking that if you think in the process of also like the clutter laser then also if you think of website then it's also just it's a cursor it's a point it's a reference because the cursor is nothing the cursor is just pointing the cursor is pointing literally but it's you don't see anything it's just it's a reference so there is something around that idea i think that you can put back in the web even if it's a laser so if you experiment with lasers that you cannot put back in the lane in the in the web then i think the reference of this point as reference that doesn't really exist uh you can bring that into the web i think like this is really like stupid and direct idea but what i don't know if anyone did this uh on the website it can be processing sketch or whatever but if you move the cursor then it would make a sound that as if you have to move the the steppers stepper motors as if it's it's in the physical space like 2d plotter then you have to move the you know the two axes to move from one point another and then it will generate the sound because there's like waters that are controlling two axes and yeah they just basically say do the same thing with the web so like if you move the cursor from here to there then just take that path and as if the motors are moving because you know basically it's a it's a speed of the cursor corresponds to the the sound of the motor like the frequency of the motor so if it's lower movement it's slower a shorter frequency and you can just use a synthesizer to make sound you know yeah i don't know what to sound like this but it could be really fun you know just to think about or like if you just yeah if you [Music] if you have like initial state you know like say like um there is no sound or there is something that is not really drastic there is an initial state for the two i mean for the plotter and x on y but if you separate this like so you have an initial state that is very calm and you have another state that is really loud and very annoying but is completely away from the initial state uh then in a way you have some i don't know functionality or some purpose it's absolutely out to the person like how much noise a person wants or not you know if if the two if two axes are in the same space there is no sound but if the two axes are in a different place there might be a really big noise or or controlling some specific sounds but like you choose that or like with the cursor that happens you i think no you should be able to control like as you're saying so then there is two i don't know i think could be interesting if there is two no let's put it simple so then you have so there's two motors that's what you said also there's two motors right so the two motors are in one place there is no sound or is very calm you know even could be visually it's something that is appealing or or not and then if if this moves it it will generate one kind of sound and then if this move will generate another kind of sound but then the further the point this one will be i think that's the rule that the farther each point will be from the initial point the louder or the the bigger the effect in the sound is we can always just like design the physics if it's website or simulation yeah of course exactly the thing that's the magic but what i think could be useful for you guys is is if you find like a an initial state like a like i say if you think also in dance then you have this because it's about like improvising together now so that you have like initially still like a safe point the people don't know what is happening and if they don't know they can go to that space and in that space the initial thing will happen so i'm saying is silence but could it doesn't have to be silence maybe it's like a a really nice composition from back you know like something that is really aesthetically nice but there is the idea behind the thing is that there is an initial state where the improvisation can go back if they don't know what they're doing they know there's always an initial place from where to start again because otherwise it goes into chaos yeah but this is like you know like a bigger score by it's i think it's something i want to come back as a dramaturgy if like even if it's an exhibition we decided to at the end it should be something more than like just having objects it has to have some kind of not a storyline but some kind of dramaturgy if someone enters you know something happens and then you know these different steps they go through if it's a performance then it's more obvious because it's more in the uh we have the time access then how do we work with like what you said like different states because it cannot be always busy we cannot just show okay these like images with plotters and then goes to images of laser cut 3d print but like what's the place where we can you know as a dramaturgy like we can come back to as a initial state or something that is not like somewhere it's more chill i'm thinking that you're touching or i'm listening to something that i think it can help you is that you have you have um you can play with time because like websites they are not time based you know like they are timeless so you can stay in a website as long as you want but maybe maybe in the way how you work with the websites perhaps is not and that could be interesting you know that you have just 10 seconds to be in that website and that's it so that you can define actually that would be interesting already like you know like why do you like that you have just certain time for certain place if you're talking about dramaturgy ready so this is very dramatic that you have just 10 seconds to do something in that website and if you don't find out what was the time so next next and next and then then you can play even with time and sometimes maybe maybe one of these websites can stay there forever it doesn't have to be always time timed but i think this element of time you can think about it because websites are normally timeless nobody's pushing you out right true it's funny yeah you have 10 seconds to find out yeah and what can be like uh the opposite uh analogy something that has time but we can twist it so that it doesn't expire like so website website is something let's say it's a permanent but we can introduce the timer then what's the counterpart or like what's the opposite like for example it can be a performance that normally has time but we could do a traditional performance i don't think i understand go back because i don't think i understand what you're saying because you said about the website which let's say we don't have time constraint in the website and so instead of like regular website you would introduce like a timer that or like you know exploration like time time web time based website yeah time skip based yeah [Music] so what could be a medium that normally has time normally is you know temporary but we could make it permanent okay yeah i'd like a performance could be like that for instance yeah but there's already durational performances which is not too like permanent but it but that's the idea right that normally it lasts for one hour or two hours but you would do it for eight hours sustain like for instance if you have like the i don't know an area of power roti or like then you have that for some reason so it's time i think like naturally if i'm just thinking a website you have this audio file that is time and for some reason you click something there's one part of this time thing that stands forever it's never gonna end so like if somebody's singing and they're singing i'm gonna stay there forever this could be a straightforward video it could be a video that someone's always there that sounds very cool the only thing i'm thinking is like like the some servers will die like what happened with this this entropy this is going somewhere like technically somebody's gonna suffer technically wise yeah also it could be funny to do something in the server and what no but they said i think it's called this that you said like uh like an endless call they will be nice i think that could work could be a project that you haven't you don't promise that you're gonna be there i mean the time is there like i mean the call is there and you or other people involved in the project that could be interesting actually you can propose to some people i will be like interested that will be part so then it's a pool of people they want to join so that project then is like at this end of the like the creative end of the project like there will be sometimes somebody but sometimes nobody but the call will be not interrupted until the end of the website until something crashes into the website yeah life of the website what can you use for that like you think as soon call you can just stay there forever i have no idea no because i think but the first thing is you need you will need a computer right you will need a computer an internet connection and hope nothing is going to happen right but but you know what you have my computer there just why don't do a zoom call but the song called you need to have another person right oh yeah sort of or whatever but yeah or we could do gtc or whatever and gt you can just join yeah it could be just youtube and you just go there and but then you have to invite some people or let note i think you have to do some creatorial thing like you have to launch the event somehow and then people know that it will stay there until something happens um but i think well i think what is interesting this is actually coming from florian this is somehow so they are building tools but moving out like motionback so they build tools for people working with dance but also in in their mind is like they're not promised i mean they can't they're not a service provider so they they provide these tools but they also they cannot be uh part of the project let's say with somebody or fleury was saying sometimes people come or they ask me if i want to be if they will if they can be part of the pro some project or something but their development bank is developing many uh tools at the same time and they're overlapping it's quite coding so they cannot give this attention like as as in art you will do i think uh to focus that the energy and then together build something up so what they're doing like they build these tools but they somehow is is actually the people the person has to find its own doing within the tool kind of similar to how the ccl runs i think there is more the ccl is more like a framework and then people should be somehow find their way then there will be people that can help them but it's not they cannot provide the project or something um i know it's it's different but for example like how we use live lab i mean live probably they have their specific use case but it's more like we just found it and found it useful and we just do it our own way but we would never ask them to you know add this feature in that feature i mean i do ask olivia but you know she wouldn't implement what i asked for yeah yeah no but that's i think it's a good example that um but so i think there is something interesting in that idea of like it's like to provide a service but you are not a service provider it's more close to open source community mentality because you don't have infrastructure also to to provide a service [Music] so i think there is something conceptual that that might be interesting you know if you think about this idea of like creating an endless video call that just you provide that and then some people will be there is you remember i think it's similar to what in in node i was doing this moving in the morning sessions and i think it's similar then some people sometimes they join and then start speaking but then it's just like an endless thing and i'm sure there should be people doing something like that um yeah that was really good because it's like it's also hacking the platform like i just put what to eat and then you know a friend of people started calling me and then the next morning we did the moving movement in the morning and then you know random people came maybe some left but some stayed and talked with you talked with us moving um yeah but it's also very difficult in jitsi because we can't really broadcast to people so we have to find but i think maybe maybe something could be interesting for you guys to talk then together with florida is that conceptual i think is i think the space that you guys are the person like i think i'm not because it's different here is that you guys i think could be your i think you want to deal with communication because you have a website so you really work with this endpoint thing and then but then you conceptually you can think with her like what does that mean you know you really break it down of what is communication you know like is it the same like one is one to one many to one like just really understanding what is communication uh [Music] because you you guys work with that like the website is that and it's a placeholder than somebody sometimes jump in there and go to get some information with a client asking to the server i mean this at the core is really uh the simple idea of the emissor requesting something and responding something is the same model that uh any comm then in communication between people is the same how in the internet goes is there is no difference in that so i think that is if you really take the time to study a little bit because you have time to understand a little bit of communication what is it then you will have resources i think i think and then and then you will find also limitations you know like um but don't don't approach it from the technical point of view before because if you start thinking from gta for instance like gt cannot do that i think better you go first and see like what actually are coming what is the communication thing and and talk with her because i also think flora will be interesting to talk with her like how fun just like researching that because you guys are really working about communication i think at the core you really have this thing a website is that i see no i it's really interesting because i never thought from that perspective and also it's also front end is like really interesting because people would come and fetch data but also like javascript is running on their browser so it's like you know it's not it's not just that like you're just reading someone's article but the article is also in a way it's alive that yeah yeah you have to understand is you have to if you fetch it it's true it's on your side yes yeah yeah this is i mean from there you can start going like i think this is something interesting and and it's it's not so giggy i mean it's like it's not necessary going to the to developing but it's something that you guys can develop together and i think floor can help us you in in thinking together yeah like i think that yeah and then we can also come back to like what is plotter what is oscilloscope what is blazer 3d printing because that yeah i think that's that's very interesting i wouldn't even think what it is at this moment because i think i would only come up with boring you have to do this uh and you have to do this um endless uh soon call you really i did something like that you have to check that because i think like nancy peck was obsessed with it was with communication that was his i mean he was obsessed with putting people together that was before the internet though so he was obsessed trying to make people from different places to co to connect um [Music] um yeah i mean i think this is very exciting like but you guys like this idea of communication you are really with the website and like things that you said for us in the fetch like this is a i wouldn't think of that like this is completely the same level so it seems interesting but so but then if you do for instance i think if you do i think if you do um if you do like something of like endless call project whatever you call it then i think it's important then the way how you approach it because so i think you need to create a communication you need to follow like a design path of normally how these things for real are being launched you need to create a fuss you need to charge it for certain people you need to send invitations if you just put it out it's not the same like i think you need to follow some protocols like and then if you follow the protocols at the end it's just that but if it's just that before the protocols you might miss some things yeah i mean i'm not okay that's pretty constructive way but um i really these days i really think media art people not many media art people know how to show stuff it can be performance or it can be exhibition but they're less experienced about like visual artists know you know they know how to put things and you know exhibit to fill the space put up the sculpture or painting or whatever but in media art i think it's kind of always like uh it's not the priority like how you show things as an exhibition or performance it's more about the like technical part that has the focus and [Music] you know like as a visitor often you don't have wow at the like when you enter the space it's not like wow but you have to see something and then okay and you have to understand what's what's behind it what's the technology but [Music] like you said about you know the designing uh like how to invite people and this is like always underestimated or overlooked as a process and as we said it's a design process that we have to think about but either if we show it as an exhibition or show it as a performance i think it's really interesting to explore that part i mean it's nothing different from what you said but i feel like it's something really needed and this is this is super interesting for me for me because for reason like now what i'm seeing i think i think i have a lot of i don't know so much about media art it seems to me that this is just i think i'm learning of this maybe one year and a half two years even though i hear from this like a little bit from time to time but so when i see some books that i see some books here and some reference then i don't know and i think in germany there is a lot of happening in here in germany or this thing or culture of that looking like for i was just reflecting like how much do i need to know you know like because before i watch some of the books that i saw today in in the in motion bank then i was more focused and now i see many books and i'm like okay maybe i should just check check um so until when do you really have to um pay attention to other sources wait i i i i i deviate from something that you were saying you speak from it from your experience that you think in media art is often there is the is overlooked the way how people present their works comparing to classical art right yes yeah okay that's something that i don't know for instance that's interesting for me to know or maybe people are just not experienced maybe also you know it's related to the fact that there's less opportunity for media artists to exhibit or perform so maybe they just don't have experience with that you know if you have a gallery space if you don't have experience then you don't know where to put things you know and it's also it's not just design it's a it's an experience that you need to have i'm not saying i have experience but i don't know where to where to go with this [Music] but interesting the user experience of art yeah but but it's really that right yeah yeah that's true because this is colliding at that point of like is the user experience of art yeah how it's very strange but like we are we are back to these uh these times of in the modern modern times everything was splitted and now as things are coming back to one thing you're like you're so supposed to know many things the same time now so i'm guessing like from here to 10 years like it will be things more condensed back but we are just start doing that slowly we are you're supposed to know many things at this time right now but the whole modernity time was about like splitting everything in something different yeah maybe in 10 years you have to get like 10 20 degrees until you're like 50s you have to study [Music] firstly i mean we're kind of on the same boat but if you think if you think actually really you think in the past like like those who have the chance and of study like everything in greek times like of philosophers like these people were they have like five careers like they were lawyers architects designers artists philosophers all in one like and i guess so yeah it just was it's different the way ho yeah if you think like how many what can you do these people like they were just doing so many things right yeah true okay yeah yeah i'm gonna think about what my next uh carrier is yeah i mean i have to also think i really to be honest like i'm thinking that like i'm seeing that i have experience like really a practical level dance and i also design and i'm thinking that i might need to spend some time like academically to connect these two um that's what i'm thinking a little bit what about the phd in art and science i really thought like to like them i have to consider that also in conversation with my girlfriend because i need to talk it has to be practical um but yeah since it seems that it needs some time to think in the middle while practicing but practicing practicing is important yeah maybe i will talk to you maybe maybe at some point and then i talk to you next week and then i do a practice from from my studio if you have the time we'll see it'll be great yeah i have my setup there so yeah [Music] okay and we'll just and speaking of practice i i we try to with floor we try to do a jam every day oh like weekdays so we have a lot of material and i think that's also like the philosophy of practicing oh so cool so you guys are practicing basically every day what you do yeah you jam oh wow that's pretty cool yeah yeah i saw something that you guys did like and i think like the one that is together always called this folk vlog look yeah yeah i saw what one and it seemed like i saw a little bit and it seems like you guys really it seems like you start almost like reading each other now like you can complement what you guys do but also you know a lot of questions i would like to see like i would like to see one of your things because i think it will be boring because you make very nice things that's the thing that's that's the question now like because also it happens also at the practice but you know like you have your own recipe already if you practice a lot that you come to the same [Music] method in a way like you mean you have the same method so you end up with some kind of similar thing each time that you have to think about how to breaking that well yeah but the thing is like i mean because what i was seeing that i'm just thinking now is i if if you are all the time with a computer i'm just saying that you're adding you're adding something um with the practice you have the possibility to physically just not do it and so then even if you are adding at some point you just don't do and you dance or you do whatever it is and then just you reset that yeah we have to end somewhere but i wanted to say something around that but like was it two weeks ago i was i was at this hot club uh like light coding um event and you know some people were just like started like during that weekend and giving a performance in the end which was really nice but also like made me think like if you started live coding you feel like you add more and more and more to make it more you know complex pattern by adding more code [Music] but to me it's more interesting when you start deleting lines or you just like completely erase it and start from scratch with something which needs some confidence to do it of course and i know that i can i can say that it's interesting because i know how to do that but i think that's kind of also like connect to the dramaturgy because you know it's not it cannot be just like going up up up up and then end but you have to have some kind of you know you have to just delete everything to change to make another scene um yeah yeah [Music] and then the problems in practice but then the problem that we you have if you think i was thinking about like sharing a workshop like you know a practice workshop the problem is then you have like is if people don't know i mean if you have like a live coding thing so you can start like playing from what you have if you have a template um and maybe you can erase and try things but wow i think this could work it's the same like you need to have is the same i think this idea of like an initial state is is is something that we can use in different places like if you don't know how live code would be great if you have a button which will send you back to the first state then you're not afraid then you're not afraid to raise the code or to it up because you have an initial state um yeah but like you said earlier like i just i say with your other example yeah i think isn't it it works in your example of the plotter but also in dancing is this idea of like to have a serial point like a basic round then you can feel free to go in different directions because you if you get lost you know that you have an initial point so then you can try to erase the whole code and maybe try from zero also but if it's not working then just just you click the button and go back uh to we know that which works which is very which is very i think i do very much like that when i do my practice with you i have my template and then i will do very much just sometimes i ask you your code and then i will just change some parameters and then sometimes it's not working and then i just copy paste the original thing right yeah [Music] that's interesting we can expand on it next time yeah all right yes it was very nice say hello to to florencia that's her name right well her name is flor de fuego i think i think her name is florencia i think yeah originally a florencia to florencia and then i see you when i see you yeah just let me know and thanks for watching uh subscribe as always subscribe like video and there are people watching this which is amazing i don't know we have to see how for how long they stay because this is more than one hour that we're talking but i know this one is more like uh yeah this is like uh i remember you remember the first chat that was like two hours or something yes true yeah okay and uh good night and see you next time", "7bNzRqsj8qs": "let's do it yes that's strong connection what up um it was good to have a weekend too much noise in this chair and used to live in one room so how is it what is the host um yeah how is it going for you we just had one day uh on friday that was the first day meeting at the academy and yeah um we just had some paperwork so we haven't started anything yet yeah i talk like briefly with flor i think she's a bit between like panicking like how to get old if she wants to do the other that your school or i feel she will be like super nervous but i was telling her like just yeah just relax and because enjoy now that you are there you start getting stressed before i mean you if you just arrive and you're stressing me it's not going to make it easier yeah exactly yeah but also i have my stress so yeah that's what do you guys have like bureaucracy do you guys have to follow like some i don't know you have like a mentor or something like that that's following what you do or how does it work we just do it on our own [Music] engineer stuff and i don't know what like how if we like i guess we do some kind of research which i don't know what it is tools website tools or website website interfaces yeah website content i think i'm a bit more relaxed now but this weekend i was freaking out like the last sunday i was freaking out a bit here like but i think it's also floridian is super busy he's i think i think he's our uh workaholic also the guy just he works so much you can see his face also he's like doing so many things at the same time that's his thing so he's basically talking in zoom calls all day long and uh that kind of okay i i guess i i understand so for me it felt like uh you know like first day i was like thinking with like oh no i should be doing i mean the rest of the thing what they do here is front end because exactly what you said like that they work in some front-end tools and they now they're trying to really focus on artificial intelligence because they know they will get more money but i mean that's the direction how it goes how it's going um so then i was thinking like oh no i should be doing something like this but then in time i remember i mean i just have to do what i do i mean i'm just thinking somehow that he will kind of fire me or something because he's my boss or like you know he will say like whether i shouldn't be doing something like that but yeah if i mean i'm here like doing basically since the beginning he was very like yeah you can come here just tell me how i can help you you guys facilitating so yeah like the conversations that i have with him are very i mean when in this in the framework that i'm working are very short and straight to the point so yeah i think i'm happy i mean for now like like it's a bit complicated because you know like to work with something that it has visuals are not get lost because what i'm trying to say is that i'm doing something technically and then i start thinking about but this is too simple you know like the i think that they're like what you wrote about the not get stuck in the aesthetics yeah exactly because it's very easy to or also because i think i should be doing something complex you know but i think with the the most important thing in my reflection and what i'm doing is that said like what i think i can i can give that is specifically what i do is is an insight in in dance uh and also with technology so but um but i'm how to say it that is the approach from the point of view of the dancer within a uh a technical framework like i'm not trying to create something that is complicated it's actually the opposite i need to i want to create something that it has to be readable for somebody who jumps in yeah and to think and to analyze to write basically uh my decisions to document basically to document what i'm doing that's what i think that's uh that could be useful for other other people because for reason this week at some point out so i was just at some point and i started thinking in deforming existing geometries and that's like like a huge topic in 3d modeling like how you deform a point from an existing geometry so like technically it's like super super complex so and then it's like do i need that you know like but before i do the questioning of like do i need that i spent like six hours trying to get to at one point that is moving like basically to to control one point of the geometry with one osc data yeah yeah but like going back to the aesthetics like is it something that like the practice can be part of it like in what i want to say is because practice is something that we don't really like try to make something good um it ends up something and yeah but it's a very different process but i was thinking like how i know it's like conceptually very different but how this is interesting like how yeah together in a sense like from i think from dancers point of view i think practice is something can be adapted can be used to you know from for dancers to go like to approach technology but then from technical standpoint of view it's more like what you're doing now like mapping and it's and you know moving points is very uh yeah basically is that exactly the moving point yeah yeah does it like a um like because i think for what i think i mean experience and also this space like for what i think is useful for some other people because actually it's not only for it's it's not only for dancers but i'm thinking actually should be for you should allow it actually to people and short at some point i grew that and it's getting more concrete more at least in my head more concrete that the idea is that somebody will use the application to visualize very simple parts of the body and have insights of their body so right and then allow them to move in a different way or like or new ways so the approach is um yeah it's just it has to be it has to say i'm taking that approach because i think that if you use system like um or projection let's say br like i'm aiming for br if i think if it's in br it will be is more gives all the it's it makes the things uh i don't know it would be nicer if it could be completely in vr the what i'm doing that is inside special awareness yeah because you can really experience the the body in the vr space so you can really feel that you are the line um and i think why are we saying that oh my neighborhood why are we saying that vr because moving points just see the body parts it was like so i'm doing kind of like the relation between in complex data visualizations then the dancer of the user say it will spend too much time in trying to mapping what is what is that body you know what is what is in this the shape in front of me my new body like the you if the if the shapes that are that are proposed are complex the person will spend more time trying to mapping it like to making the reference this is my arm this is my leg this is my head then moving um and i think and that's what i'm trying to experience to see that rather when you have some reference points say like the logical ones are your arms and then you create like this line between these two points and the idea is not that you stay there somehow with the line but allows you to go away and and then to come back maybe sometimes and and somehow maybe i make some that makes me think in the practice because i'm not thinking i'm not pro i'm not proposing to create something thinking that the user is going to stay there all the time and doing just this thing if he's if he's between the hands and the stay all the time here but the writer then is doing that but sometimes they just can't just go away and dance and still have the reference point for sometimes to come back because in dance improvisation techniques also you have very often this ground zero like when you improvise which in a way always i i put it also in the paper that it's like thinking on state and programming and in dancing improvisation you use a lot of this state so you go in a flow but when you get lost or something you know there is an initial state you go back um and that's what i'm uh what i think is it's important also i was like when you're saying about lines i was more thinking about like using as an instrument because if it's simple enough like even if it's simple uh the user or the dancer can just you know start playing with it and then you can go beyond just lines i mean like basically that is using as an instrument like that line becomes something like a life or something like that is what you're saying could be or well i was just saying because i was thinking like for example what could be this is something i've been thinking like for some time are you still here okay i lost you yeah i lost you too um so i was thinking about this idea like for some time actually um what could be the tracking or like what could be like something interactive we can use in the practices and it could be super simple for example just use webcam and like what's the overall brightness and that's super simple like it's not even tracking but still you can play with it for example i can cover the camera right and then that will trigger something for example and then like even if it's something super simple we could do something like technically it's very simple it's just checking the values i mean everything is just you know comparing the values but it's up to the user how you use it no but i think this is that you're saying it's interesting because this is close to this idea like tracking quality somehow i know that if you say for instance if you're tracking the brightness i i think it's still i will say that still you're tracking because you keep on eye basically you're not motion tracking because you're not block tracking let's say right but you are tracking you are keeping you're keeping an eye in something specific that is happening within the pixels so that's tracking anyway um yeah that this is interesting and then it's more about more like a practice thing that you know how you want to use it that we just have to try it like without adding more complexity in the technical sense yeah even if it's lines between hands for example you we could do something with that how to track of what i'm of what i do sorry i i i lost you for some time i said like that i that i still in what i'm doing i'm i'm lacking or i feel there is lag i mean for me some conceptual ground somehow that i think it will come in time um but it's just i'm saying this because when we talk of practices and the way we perceive concepts in a practice that is the way i see digital i mean they feel comfortable with dance in that con in that place is very oh no it's very this is uh one of the not the worst but one of the [Music] most unstable [Music] chat are you back yes so it is very and then i lost you and did you hear that i said like i am i am at the clinic no i mean what i meant is the last thing that i said is that there is like in what we do in the practice the way how we see the word and the practice in best practices and the way who i experience dance here is like as we we have this inside joke back in time that i am at the clinic you know this is the clinic is the stereo this is sterile this is the clean this is the clinic of the data motion capture motion bank is the click yeah exactly so it i guess i'm missing the the dirty like so some dirty but it it cannot be so much that what i'm kind of starting is really really really i'm trying to go these and actually document and writing um a lot my decisions why they come from because as i said again i think what i can give is is a specific insight i i what i have one what i have to do very fast is the process of what is this some steps yeah you know to create data visualization models for me then recording my body improvising the studio keeping in mind the models so if i propose a triangle that was what i proposed last week then i'm going dancing thinking that i will have only my right shoulder my left hand and my left feet so already i'm going like that and aiming to create that in real time but at this point it's not in real time because it still need to they need to do something with it i'm not going to do that um then so create models then record create models for my body in the space record my body in the space then uh dance and then when i dance like trying to and that this is important like when i dance like doing like dancing trying to switch between and then between [Music] a rational cognitive process uh so the conscious of me being the triangle or the line right uh of my presence in space and this and switching between the embodied cognitive process of the flow so being or conscious of my form or being on the flow instead of flowing just as so the improvisation will have that and every morning i'm doing from nine to ten i do something that is every morning i'm doing a movement session that the last the last week floridian i joined by the way one day and he's willing to go in crazy for dancing that was really funny yeah it was fun that was good fun like yeah yeah i think florian is a very interesting person i think he knows very much um and what i want to think to learn being here is a and it's more he has he can give really insights like conceptually something that is technical without just manipulate or is the way how i feel he's really is weird suddenly i stopped hearing you is it blind no no my headphones are working what happened oh now i hear you you know i hear you okay oh my god this is that your video is gone yeah but it's okay i hear you so now you're back the internet with the pink oh yeah yeah is that your light yeah because i have to my my room is so so so white that is depressing white because i'm really in the center of the city so there is no really light coming inside so i need to put some color light to give to make me happy just really sad [Music] um yeah but so yeah something sure what i was trying to say is like i need i want like i need to trust that the decisions that i'm taking are the right for now so i just need to prototype and go fast and go in that process i'm i'm in the clinic so i'm doing a research basically so i'm in the cleaning so i i i'm kind of following a scientific research so far somehow in the same in the sense of like choosing the model of research proposing a hypothesis like um i'm saying that the fact that i am a dancer will uh have a an impact in the decision that i take as a technology in the term in mapping the process then i choose my model then in a way these steps then i prototype them and i adjust them and then i do the process again and but in doing this it feels very so it then i go back to what i was saying before technically it feels like super like simple like like aesthetically then i think like this is not interesting it's not looking good or something like that and then conceptually it feels also there is lacking something i don't know exactly what is and i was saying that and i started all saying all these things because i feel there is a huge imbalance between the way how i perceive the dancing digital dance with you and the way i'm doing it here and i just hope with the days and with the weeks will somehow make more sense [Music] right now it's a very yeah far away from but i okay i have i don't have any idea but i felt something like when you said like so you move with the triangle in your mind and the other thing you said it was the flow but then i was thinking like what is there something else other than the triangle that you can think of and then moving which i thought like that's kind of like okay this is interesting actually so i thought like that would be something like a drastic change if we can introduce something but that's actually just a just a normal dance workshop you know you just feel fluid or you know you think you know there's always do you have this like topic like that something that you keep in mind and you rule and but that's just normal thing in the dance workshop or like the dance practice but that could be oh i don't hear you again yeah i don't hear you yet okay i don't hear you yes and i'll hear you back i didn't listen the last maybe just five seconds okay like you're saying then that's working that you have this thing yeah yes so these things but but it's interesting because we already do that in a dance as a dance practice and so what i don't know but [Music] but maybe i don't know why what why i feel this is interesting but i i felt something is i'm thinking there's something interesting here it will come back yeah like maybe maybe i think the way my i feel that might come back somehow is like maybe in the vr space uh because it's so clean i mean there is nothing and also i'm not doing anything inside it's just a black space where i see something that is moving but the thing is so far i haven't seen myself inside but it was just a recording from effect so it was just really boring this  triangle because it was something that was recorded to do something else like the the fake choreography it moves a lot in the space so one of the things that i said in the article is that i know that actually i want to the motion that i propose has to stay more or less in space in the in the in the ground zero so i don't want to move too much in the space for two reasons one because of natural things of br space i mean i don't want to just hit myself with the wall you know fall just natural vr constraints and second because what i'm more interested in is in in in yeah i guess more the exploration of the whole skeleton somehow um which is in a bit like we are like with dancing i think i mean at least long time ago i'm not like thinking dance like this um so maybe i mean and i haven't i haven't the experience yet of being in the 3d space with this so i hope maybe when it happens then it feels like oh wow it feels super nice or something but now when i just see this triangle i'm like this is just this is triangle moving yeah it's just yeah i mean and i think and i think there is there is a problem with if there is like a a mapping problem in how to say like for instance i was using uh a box in a 3d space and i map so i found a way after like six hours uh and asking people how to demorv two points of the box with my two hands i mean with the hands of the motion capture but then because the other two points were attached to the original place where the box is the the motion seemed very small you see what i mean because if because because some mapping problem there is some mapping problem between just the distance uh then from in relation to the original point uh to the points that i map for some reason they didn't look like this let's say but it will more look like this because of the dimensions of uh of the dimensions of how original is the the box or this is the whole thing with the mapping thing right and then easily then then i can just go in and trying to fix it uh which it will happen very often i think what is important is to keep the like keep on like in your head like is what is that you're trying to achieve with it is it yeah yeah but is it [Music] maybe you already worked on this but like motion capture is in three space and but that's not how we especially as an uber how you perceive the space is different from how it's captured with y z because you wouldn't think about x y z coordinates to move it's more about your body as a reference but wait let me let me think a little bit even when i'm thinking consciously you know like i'm trying to really push if i'm dancing now of course and you're in my head i'm not maybe yeah like you will not think an expert said you will have a if you're conscious and you're you will have a reference of terms of space but you're not thinking it makes the process in your head really slow to start thinkings and why it's according it makes no sense i mean your head like the process in your head that goes so more far away you're more advancing the way how you position yourself than the computer yeah and even if you think about xyz that's something there is some reference with your inside your body to convert you know what how you move into xyz in the space so it's it's always like you your body is in the center in a way yeah your body or the bodies yeah yeah somehow it's like you have some kind of quaternion reference like in your body you always yeah there is one thing that i grew up with like that i found there is this uh concept i don't know if you've heard before like the the curse of dimensionality i saw that word but i don't know if i but it's basically the idea behind is this idea that every time that's more for high density data sets anyway but anyway this idea that every time you introduce a new data data point in a data set then it will create uh the problems of it will create bring problems if you will work with more dimensions like if i work with 2d space and then i put a new point in reference to i mean it's just like really fast kind of scale into this madness that i am very constant i'm seeing if i use the vr space then i have to start thinking in the camera of the light or it and it just goes exponential in this thing right because of the dimensionality every element that you put inside it will add something new and it's right and i think it's fine if you know exactly what are you after so let's say if your goal is to create a photorealistic uh i don't know if like yeah a photorealistic impression of me in this room in a 3d space then you know somehow like what you have to deal with but if you don't know what you're doing and also you are lacking a lot of this 3d whatever information then it's very fast you can get lost in doing things that you're not they're not bringing anything into your research what was i what right uh wait what was the topic yes yes this is nice i like the body quaternion they're quatering geniuses i think but but also what you said is like if i try to make direct connection the problem is you have rich data we have like so many data points but that's not directly related to the body or how you move it's like a trackable quality is also maybe that comes in as well but like first of all like we need to find like before we think about mapping maybe that's before the system you're speaking up you're speaking before the system right before the computer system okay yeah this is interesting like how like what is actually the connection between how you move and what we get from the motion capture can you repeat this what is this what is the connection connection between the your perception of the body and the data points that's for the perception of a dancing body and what and let's say motion capture what is the correlate connection the thing one of the things is maybe i mean it just came comes in my oh i lost you again the sound i don't i don't hear you i don't hear you like as soon as you started speaking no yeah i hear you again but as soon as you started speaking i lost you so i know you're into it [Music] anyway so i was saying um did that i think this like hopefully i think has you know what i think in short i think it has there's a problem of practice it has to be deal a lot with practice because i'm saying that um i feel alienated in this space because i haven't practiced enough so my guessing is like if i practice more in that space it should get better you see with the motion capture i thought a cloak or something that's constantly moving okay this would work and now i lost you yeah i can hear you yes it was a bit choppy oh yeah yeah man those swatches make such a huge noise oh sorry i mean not for me i mean i don't hear it but i because i i call it i have those watches they make huge noise in the room yeah okay before what is the connection so i think has to be with practicing i agree but it's also like but the thing is practicing that costs money i mean or let's say no money but it costs it's expensive i think that's why we have like some kind of a recipe that is good because it's not for us it's not expensive is is good yeah but exactly that's what i wanted to say that it has to be you know affordable it has to be something that we can just try that whenever we want yeah yeah it's like kind of you know it somehow feels like when you have like really good friends and then just you don't talk with them but you know that anytime you just see them and he's like you know that it's not like a girlfriend and you have to say hello to her at least every few days you know these friends that you just have like for life that just um but in that sense maybe that's it's close to all these problems that we have with computers you know like uh yeah but always when you work with computer systems then you go you aiming to efficiency to [Music] to make cheaper like the consumption of energy but also yeah you always go in if efficiency you know how like the code also also they yeah make the the system to use less resources always goes in that direction um yeah and also you know it's exclusive it doesn't it because of the efficiency they want you to use it in a specific way and if you try to use it in a different way then you're kind of excluded or you have to have you know find a community that is using let's say a computer in a wrong way yeah so but then can you repeat this you said like the whole thing that you said more or less uh because of the efficiency they try to exclude you you have to use it in a specific way to be efficient and if you use it in a different way which may be not deficient maybe wrong but that's what we want uh then you're kind of excluded or you have to otherwise you have to find people who's doing that but then i this is i guess that's why we like them i feel this imbalance you know right because it's like of course completely going in a different direction um but it should be some i mean it should be possible how or at least is what i'm trying to do somehow to how can bring something i mean all this thing that we speak with in this that i'm doing um but the thing you know what is the thing maybe that's why i'm kind of like going cautious but i'm i guess inside i'm just trying trusting my decisions because also i guess i have a perception of perspective of seven more weeks right so this but this is not really conscious but i i know for instance that working working with everything there is anything that is chaotic it just goes like in one second it just explodes it it happens that we have this good practices like you know like it's kind of clean the image and at some point and just like you put maybe i don't know in less than a minute the whole screen just like boom right right and that's that's chaos theory [Music] so i'm saying this in relation to i guess i want to bring chaos somehow like this approach this is what we're speaking i'm trying to i guess i'm i'm seeing as a chaos um and i guess i want to introduce that chaos i want to destabilize i want to glitch what i'm doing this is yeah because actually that's what we know yeah that's what we know and actually when i talk with the scot i remember the first day and then i was in the ccl i think one of the last days i have this conversation of being a bit nervous not knowing what to do here or something and then uh and i remember it's because hey what i showed the last day that it was this particle system controlled by its opposition um and then he was he says that he was surprised that i did not any uh what i told him because the first day when i arrived i told him in short what will we do with you and he was very interested he was he was completely completely good idea and he was like oh uh yes and he put me to to speak with the guy from the who was in charge of that and then i was talking with him and they were very interested in what i was saying um so he got this and yeah there's something i guess i it has i want to bring it somehow i want to do [Music] yeah but it has to be in time it cannot be it has to be in time um otherwise i'm like let's say otherwise just explodes maybe and then in one in two in in a week my my me freaking out because i don't know what the to do because the feedback just cover the whole screen and i don't know how to clean it yeah yeah i i understand um [Music] so so what i was thinking something uh not the chaos part but how to introduce glitch and this is hard because i've seen you know some examples they try to hack into motion capture like they would detach markers or sensors and then you know the avatar starts going crazy or um what else yeah let's say that's one example but then but it's where also in which context are you speaking that was one of the shows from the research paper i shared you some time ago that they did like user study of dance pieces oh cool the technology and then one of the pieces was about uh they were using uh the i forgot the name uh neuro no since uh what it's called uh iran there was a neuron thing yeah but i think yeah i think that's one and then the performer at one point uh removes the sensors and the avatar is projected on the screen and that goes like crazy because it cannot track anymore which i think it's it's uh you know it's a nice example but at the same time it also for me it feels like you have to kind of still you have to follow the rules you cannot just go completely in the wrong way you cannot have crazy feedback loop but you are like maybe inverting the color but not going you know to another dimension and i think i lost you again come back wait no come by [Music] a little bit yeah so that example was like kind of it's glitching but still you have to follow the rules you have to calibrate the sensors you have to use sensors like normally and then you detach them so it becomes something but it's like it's just like you know tip of the iceberg yeah it's like you know it's not like really glitching the whole image but maybe changing the color a little bit you know that's how i that's how i feel it and then i think but it seems to me that it's like in i completely agree with you that like i think that's a good question like how to introduce glitch you know or how to work with rich because it's so powerful it just it just takes over right so and then i think it's i think a safe way because i'm i'm thinking and composition you know that um but a way to go with like to because we are speaking about something that is like if there is no rules for these things like up in digital art everything is just being built now but they're not really canons that you can relate to um in comparison with classical art so i think um a safe way to uh introduce glitch is like as you said respecting somehow the the build if you build something using certain protocols or rules then then you can start taking pieces of the puzzle in certain way that is compositional um yeah [Music] and on the other hand like if you look at the practices because it's so simple which is not simple but it looks simple so we can dump different things or take different things out or break things it's really free because it's like we start from the blank canvas wait wait wait it's really waiting you just don't hold away yeah so with respect to rules hold up yeah click holder build and so what you were saying with the practice the practices are more like it's like blank canvas or there's no rule so it's we can completely break it but we build somehow [Music] the rules are simple simpler than motion capture yeah technically speaking true i mean but technically it's actually not that simple no with all these slide labs and stuff obs but still it's i don't know why it's why we can break it but i think feel it's more like radical oh i i think i lost your voices again [Music] okay can you hear me yes so i was thinking the maybes because we never built something in the practice you know right it's like we have never arrived somewhere right right like and that's the thing this is a cue point because if i'm thinking in what i'm building now i know even though it's not clear what i'm close to it you know i know that i need to create a model like before i know i know i go i mean i already have the rules and i know i want to iterate them rules so well in a practice like we know that we use these tools and we know that we meet in live line we know the timing but so but we never build something right four we build during the practice and it's a sandbox so it's just wiped out yeah it's like it's like in constant demolition or like constant like you create something i just constantly down and it's down it's down again and again again yeah but you cannot do with the motion capture like that no because it's expensive yes like alone money expensive not necessarily like the money but it's just expensive it practices very cheap yeah it's i would say this affordable i would say this is affordable it's cheap because we need to make it not cheap it's affordable yeah in terms of affordance but yeah affordable or it's more like it's it's more like uh like a grocery money bet like you have to get it every day you know it's but it's not it's not unimportant you have to eat something so you go to the supermarket it's it's essential but it's also affordable but the problems that we go back to that is essential for us but it doesn't have a value right i mean in terms of i mean not not for us like that it doesn't have a value that the motion capture might have let's say in in another context right um so that that's why it's difficult not like when you try to place it in places because it doesn't have a concrete value it's not it's not a [Music] yeah it's not it's not a video it's not dance also it's something that is it lingers completely in between yeah it's not it's not it's neither but it's also both so but then i was thinking like so just if we just straight go straight get straight to the point i think the question is how can we use motion capture how can we break motion capture or how what's what's new like what's how can we use it in a queer way let's say and how do i like this how to break how to break motion capture i mean and that is another idea that just you record and you don't calibrate the system because well if you don't calibrate the system but uh then you get this image did i show you this i guess no like then you have this button like this what's it i mean i can imagine but you know i can imagine that's okay it's just a body it's just the the some of the points are that were not very calibrated so there were some weird stuff um [Music] but the idea is um behind is it's the same like thought that the i said i was saying that how to break motion capture or respecting the rules with perspective that motion capture you can only try to use is there a cooler motion capture this is interesting i can even start moving the cameras how much cameras like the motion capture cameras well it's not no it's a it's the same as uh removing the motion tracker kind of idea but [Music] the problem i mean but in this case everything else is not so different from what we do because for instance with respect in the practice we have to respect the system because if i don't go if i say like i'm doing queer dance um digital dance i'm not gonna use chrome today i'm not gonna use a browser i cannot connect with you right right so like so we and actually we want to make in live lab i cannot just say like no  it i'm not gonna use it because it's part of my we are really respecting this all these protocols right but then we and there's there are many protocols we record that these humans are really it's really compelling but nevertheless then we get to a point when we start just  nothing like just done really like meshing within a sandbox yeah it's a sandbox but we build the sandbox yeah slowly and it's a point it's quite big sandbox i didn't i never thought about it but like how i feel about motion capture is the sandbox is so tiny that you can do something but it's so limited [Music] our sandbox is like super huge that you can just run around or like you know we come closer but we can go somewhere else we build something you know like it's so free or maybe it has another dimension in the sandbox yeah but the thing is i mean but it's true because for the thing is like what is that the problem that we break this is the kind of kind of a problem that when i say like when i mentioned about flora when she works with 3d by the way i saw so the last thing that she is making they're getting super cool they're super nice but they're looking good also you know like so that i don't find it so interesting because then me i think it's interesting from a technological point of view in terms of it's cheap it's because super cheap she don't need to have like a 30 90 rtx or something to create these things um but uh yeah anyway so this is in relation to uh [Music] why are we saying the thing with floor because of the dimension that because of dimensionality yeah because because i think what we have we have is that we break the demand so this idea i think this is a skew this is king what we're talking this one of the main things that i'm telling you that i'm dealing every day at every time is the cur the concept of the curse of dimensionality this is really at the core of what i'm doing um so i think in the practice we we found an algorithm somehow that is bypasses that problem because if i'm practicing with you because we did it last year when i was in buff i can go half an hour away having a coffee you don't know when i'm coming back you're still practicing so it's just so like the dimension and the presence the spaces just break completely right what do you say like the the sandbox it just goes and comes back and the sandbox i think there is an idea that the sandbox is is like a blob i think the sandbox that we have is a blob is really the morph in in the whole space and depending on what we're doing sometimes you were also outside one day you left your house so it's it's very malleable but in the motion capture is is very rigid or at least from the outside because it might be it could be i guess possible to deform respecting the the protocols you know like you cannot put a camera outside because you need the camera to point to record you otherwise you don't have it or if you do it should be some reason why somehow i was thinking like if you're still here um let me just continue anyways to verbalize oh okay you're back um i was thinking like for example if it's like marker based motion capture you can track any object like this but you just put markers and then it could be interesting to track this object instead of myself but still it's about myself you mean but so yeah like this is moving and it's not tracking my movements but this is like as a result of my movements and if you're dancing inside your dance [Music] i think it's more interesting because then it's it becomes indirect but i think their system is different type of motion capture right you don't have to put the markers no this camera yeah but i guess what it could be i don't know how complicated it would be but but what it could be is that maybe the way the bodies read you might you might alter the rig of the body you can still capture the body but maybe the rig like it's a skeleton that is weak when the camera is from every position maybe you can alter somehow that rig or other thing i was thinking was what if you are with someone but you don't use data or your skeleton but you are the protagonist in a way that you are the mover and the other person is tracked you use the data from your partner but how and what do you mean i think i don't follow i so you are use your data so let's say we are in the same space and i want to do something with my movement my i want to do a digital dance with my move but then instead of using motion capture to track my movement i track your movement in the same space but then we are let's say i mean this is open we can be dancing together or i move you physically or you know that's that's very open but i but i don't use my skeleton as a product but i don't understand how okay no no like this is going to technical place um so then the idea behind is then using the other ones wait wait because i think one of the problems is that motion capture very often what it happens is then you don't it's not real time let's say that you don't you record the data and then you're doing post production these things right so we are talking about in a scenario there is real time right no it can be both so let's say let's say we dance together well dance can be anything and then then i just present your skeleton as a this is just a simple like effect player kind of thing that you are moving but that's my but i use that as my dance i don't know it just makes sense but but i like it but in the effect player i'm not present but you are present but that's my that's i mean it's not ownership that i want to say but i don't know but like because this is that you're saying so i mean i found it if what i found interesting from what i understand is like it becomes something when it's about the ownership like when it's about somehow like it goes in that direction that said in the data player i'm just saying that i am i mean instead of saying jorge i say so yeah just change the name so the people but is my movement so then people when see your skeleton dancing they will think that is me yeah or vice versa or whatever or vice versa this one however yeah but what i'm more thinking is how to make it indirect what's what's the you can be the dance medium when you like or like you know let's say it's it's a lot about myself but instead of capturing myself i capture you and you are the medium like you know the spiritual medium that takes my movement and takes my movement into digital tract points but i don't want to be tracked by myself but i want to be a dance well it's like a boat i mean it's like a choreographer right i don't understand completely but for it seems to me like going in the direction of this guy two phi pi [Music] no but uh i don't know i i just i i was just thinking like how to put something in between my body and motion capture something in between to make it a bit softer or it could be even like i'm not in the same space but you could be captured but but i mean it's again the same thing but i feel oh you're gone okay yes you're back i lost you yes i lost you yes wow we spoke so much in this man i think we should cut like today you were really yeah i guess i said yeah very interesting to see also like horde now to be better okay we should cut um yeah i lost you completely so i couldn't hear what you're interested in not just in the conversation that like because you're having different input and having different input so we make sense i think what is amazing is that we have we it's like we speak it we speak practice it's super super super cool this is so cool this is like the ground zero of the improvisation that i do yeah that's exactly what i want to say yeah and we know that it's very solid that we can always go back to and clearly i'm i'm looking forward also to see what you guys do with floor because then you will bring out some more i need more man yeah let's see and i hope you have good connection at the university at least the network and the internet connection uh we have good yeah i hope you have a stable connection actually in the motivation bank in the second floor is up for some reason it's really bad like i mean it's they have a it's fast but it's unstable for some reason so i i just if i need to download something i just wired which is very weird welcome to germany yesterday i was yeah actually the internet it seems really really creepy crappy here yeah but also when i was in austria yeah and when we were new now also in austria the internet was really up the german man yeah okay um good night thanks for the chat that was very good uh please send me this video yes it's very interesting at one point i was thinking like maybe i just cut the first part and upload but i think there's too many glitches but maybe it's fun but i don't want the idea i just upload it like if you want to upload it then it would be fine i don't think yeah they didn't say anything bad so thanks for watching thanks for watching oh no i mean this is why i always like keep overreacting and talking when jorge is lost but maybe i just like maybe you're laughing like smiling so i fish here wait like this i take photos oh no oh no bye [Music]", "O5F9m2pOvmk": "i want to show you [Music] hey all right i want to show you something new the screen sharing you know here's my kitchen okay i'm showing this uh where's this thing working [Music] that's the head of that's the head of this person of the purple person okay um yeah okay i just wanted to show but let's see if you want to change it's basically like circling but you just see it yeah but actually i'm not using uh well you can just do that for a second here like i'm not you i'm just you this is par actually it's coming from reading these texts like i think big big part of the problem of data representation i mean when we talk about body is that there are so many possible values and if you think like now the the capture systems are better you can have even more so like for instance like from this thing i can just choose an among those amount of data and [Music] so so it was part of coming from there then so i just choose one join which is the head but then i was choosing just to use the x and y position that's why they're going x in the x position and the y and because it's the head the head is not going down until i know for instance in some part of the dance they start falling and then you can see you see when they when they now they're moving the head more down so then you see more like the head down and when it goes into the through this into the so if i use the x axe is this one if i use the set position yeah then i start doing something then you can see actually more mapped to in 3d in 3d yeah and this is more clear i guess when they go and then the other thing i would start thinking or it was like doing the average of this like so this is this is what it happens now this is the the xy and set position of the head right of the purple cancer and in real time so what i was thinking and i have it somewhere here is to have the average of that motion i mean of that joint uh during time averaging time the average in time of the x y and set position and then again you start seeing and then seeing next to each other and then basically what it happens is like in a way smooths they allow the curve uh well but so this is kind of like the kind of madness that i am right now so like um but i think so we wanted to talk with auto uh about what what would you want to talk what we want to talk about what oh about ellen's uh project maybe wow that was the so there was some text about motion capture right yeah i mean it's it's more about the the performance itself i think tele telematic performance back in 2011 from alan pearlman she's based in new york and back then i think she was doing this in uh calgary i think when she was studying canada and she was collaborating with uh university in hong kong and new zealand maybe and they were doing some kind of um like remote telematic like network connected performance that the dancers are in hong kong and the motion capture like their movements are captured motion capture and uh this video screen in canada that's affected by the movements and the musicians are in new zealand yeah but like what i thought it was interesting is that it's something that is it was really long time ago uh agreeing i mean in terms of technology is like 10 years it's like really long time ago uh really long time ago uh it was funny that she was using vdmx [Music] and but some of the concepts that i mean i really like that that the text that you're giving because all these papers that i received from daniel that is one part one of the research uh external researchers of motionbank he's a phd i don't know what so it's really really into into more scientific approach uh it's really comes down really into a very heavy scientific paper like a lot of these resources that in yeah three-dimensional space i'm talking about a lot of things that i don't know and also not know so it's not my interest but what i think it was really one from this uh and her paper the one that you sent me is that um i think there was like the problem that she was like uh she refers like uh one of the things that she was mentioning is like the amount of data uh she refers like some somehow like to choosing uh like that the problem of the representation of the body in uh through data so in through computer systems it has to deal a lot with the limitations of the systems um and also because the you should use a lot the word telematics known so like the the networks um it's on super old school this board like telematics really back in time like but i what i'm trying to say is like something that really keeps and i'm trying to i don't know what is in my head but it is it's trying to form formulate something it's about the problem with this thing is um in terms of like making something has to be with variables uh you know like how to to limit the variables like which variable do you choose uh yeah i don't know what what do you think about this like yeah i think it's like this um she specifically writes about data mapping from the motion capture to events uh triggered in video and i think that's really just a very smart way of doing it it's it's very simple like basically i think there are some triggers like if the i don't know the the arm or the leg exceeds some threshold which is the point of the head or something like that and then that triggers some glitches in the video and that's just like a very simple way of doing gesture recognition but it really works well because the piece is choreographed so you know when this is hap this happens but not that in a way that it's scripted but the dancers can trigger these effects through the choreographed movements and it's quite similar to what you're doing now with uh with the piece effect because you know what the piece is about so you can work on certain aspects of it rather than working with the whole body yeah and now actually i found a way how to like this the side side thing is because i have all this data like and sometimes i just want to use something is that so now i found a way how to record and extract part of this data with those designer so i can i can record the data and and then bring it back uh but the thing is that then i found then i get into more pro i mean sata record part of this data right and so this is like this and then i record just this because there are just some parts that i want to uh for me work like the the values that i get are more interesting than the whole piece right so then i just and also the computer is ways is way cheaper for the computer if i just play a file then just keep the computer listening for 80 points coming through osc is way cheaper because that's so for the the player the effect data player is quite heavy um so anyway so i found a way how to to take a chunk but then when i put it back somehow then so it does but it has to now they have a problem with resampling basically an interpolation which is so how i took a chunk uh or uh which is based on maybe just gonna share like uh the things easy if i just share whatever yeah what i did so i used something that is like uh collect trails in this system touch designer there is a modular uh programming interface and these trails allow to record so this will record uh based on the so it comes the data this is the osc so this is what it comes from from here it comes here then i select just the the head and i do something and then the trails here's what what i can record and then when i then i reset this is the length how long do i want to do that so if i want to keep it for i don't know for a minute then it's 60 seconds and then the line will keep on going for 60 seconds and then i just save it as some save channels as some exporting type the problem is when i resample when i when i put the file back it will not do the playback of the data in the same sample rate in in in simple is that the data that i record it will not be played like that but it will have a different speed in short and and that just opened a lot of like basically audio manipulation in this case with this software because it's about understanding the sample rate resampling interpolation and things that you can if you can just keep on going in a in a in a black hole that it might not be necessary um that's what i was trying to say um i was mentioning that because uh what i think is interesting from maybe a producer of the of the paper of hers is like the way how she and how she made it is that she make a triangle between she chooses the head so she choose three points uh six points per dancer she choose the to choose the shoulder the wrist and the and the feet then and in each in each size then basically she has a mesh right she has a mesh between these points constantly changing that's what she gets um and that was very clever because then in a way has something that it changes because it this will change a group like very trusted like in this case first in my case if you see my my data because the head is not changing that much in the y-axis i don't have so much of this effect um and i think that was very clear from her like like how to choose these values and also what you were mentioning that there are these triggers then only when it passes center a certain threshold then the animations will be triggered so like i'm i'm saying all these things because i think we we speak hear a lot about is this is a variable it like how is is is it's about the variables which are the variables that you want to choose why and then because in a way like i'm kind of like i can uh i'm kind of sometimes getting lost in a loop uh of information where like you know every time you will try to do something there will be another problem and then another and another another but the thing is is could be uh could be could help me to think more about the variables that i need like uh in terms of what i'm trying to do uh yeah think more more in an abstract way like in a programming point of view like something that is more abstract okay like not but not conceptual [Music] this is interesting because can you can you give us a short like what is like an abstract thinking good programming what do you think an abstract in uh an abstract class is a class that can take in many forms right oh like abstract class yes um but it's but it's also that it's not concrete it's you cannot use it because it's abstract no yeah yeah it's something that is kind of working like as a constructor like you have it you you use it and then you put so but like in a way then you have this as abstraction that it has variables that become parameters after like these variables without these variables with all the parameters that they cannot be used right they're just an abstract class cannot work without implementation right right so uh so those parameters are they have to be concrete they cannot be abstract they have to take some shape right but you're talking about the class or is you're talking about the what you're doing sorry i have it lost i think i'm mixing up here um i don't know i think i'm a bit confused like i mean there are different things that i'm thinking like for instance like um i think one of the main problems that you you have the thing that is in front of your face when you're trying to represent the body or you or you're trying to do like data visualizations from the body is that you have this roughness of the space the dimensionality that you enter a part of the embodied thing a part of all the body things that comes from being human and having a body all the embodiments all what it means to have a body just the physical thing of your body being representing represented in a in another dimension uh right that's that's that's what the the whole problem is with with 3d graphics oh for in my understanding of my appreciation is always like and we have like some time that i talk about floor for instance when she floored i see when she was doing what she works in a two-dimensional space trying to make in 3d uh things then the problem becomes for me as a viewer then the space is very full of things that i don't understand so like what i'm trying to say like in a three-dimensional space like you it's kind of like you need to understand what is going on yeah yeah like i don't know if it's what you're talking about but basically we have this 3d space in the computer in a way that we can render but it's not related to how the space is in our real life in a way i mean it's the same idea but you have different politics yeah but and actually because this is what i think what i will say like there are politics that i'm not trying to bring in the conversation today like we talk about like that's what what we do in the best practices is like we deal with politics basically um in a very clever way i think um because we just practiced but anyway um i think what we speak here about is that so when i will say like politic slash politics slash uh embodiment yeah all these things that is about embodiment of what it means to be a human with a body you can bring there and and then part of the text she will she will mention with that she is very clever she mentioned about cultural gestures that's something that i have in my notes like because those are from and from a theatrical point of view when you're thinking composition also you will think olivia my friend from brazil so she was she mentioned that like these cultural gestures things that are in one culture means something in other place and those are key points that people normally will like constantly you will you as a human you try to when you go to a new place you are comparing constantly right because these are just your gestures that's what we do so uh one of these um [Music] so but what i was saying oh i get lost man what's this and get lost so yeah we have the representation on the computer we have embodiment or the real space real thing and you said about the cultural gestures which so you can think in inside the 3d space 3d grid you have different kind of gesture in there is that what you want i think yeah i think it's somehow yeah yeah but i think somehow it has to be related how like somehow we gesture in an abstract way uh in palm with variables how you can make them calming of um a gesture uh yeah but it's also related to what people are saying at the choreographic coding labs in the past uh this keyword that always comes back uh was it uh trackable quality because the idea is i mean it's kind of abstract idea that what kind of quality you can capture through motion tracking or it's not even that like concrete it's just like people talk about the you know different words that are very abstract um and i don't know where this is leading to um i can find some notes but i don't know if yes and i'm thinking that what you said this is the last time i flirted at some point when he was giving some feedback basically because i just made some things like i'll send you some of these things and he was asking me like okay but so why why you know like why are you doing this you know like um and then at some point he was saying that he talked about the fortunes and then i have to thought of you he said what is affordance he was giving me some feedback and said like okay so i want you to think of this like okay so think from what it comes from like so think of a bit more why are you doing this with the why why are you doing this uh also because the word tool-based uh indeed and and i think now this is more like my experience without being yet in motion bank in mind now is that they have this they're making tools they have to be practical so one of the feedback that i got from florian is like i put fast like effects kind of things sometimes with the things that i was showing and that's something that he said like that's something that we were doing in the past somehow uh but i think like now they're trying to focus on something that is more practical uh okay but it's in any way like it's open no he said like it's open like you don't have to do it in this way you just have to think about it um so but yeah so what he was saying basically think of think of what you're doing from what it comes from this this that you're doing and what can this and so after you finish after you present something what do you think you can think what are what this 30 can uh what is the importance of these things like if i so for instance if i just do uh a percent like just a tracking system like what up what i was showing you was a tracking system basically um then what that systems what is the affordance of that system maybe you can be good can you can you maybe deepen bit more in this idea of affordance what is affordance affordance but like when you say it like is it for other people other for example like very practical but other dancers can benefit for like they're rehearsing or for example i don't to be honest the first time i heard like the word affordance was with you yeah but what was that because of the the installation we were making maybe no yes actually yes it was when we started it's like i think it's really close to the like the way we use agency like you know i think i already talked about this uh example but basically like the door handle you know like it's a good example affordance because you know how to use it basically if you see it like um you know if it's like a vertical bar then you know that if you either you push it or pull it but if it's like a handle that you can you know twist then you would twist and then push it or pull it so it the form it sounds is an implicit already in the object like it's implicit more or less before even you go there then this is something that like it just makes a good mark like when we were thinking about the installation please don't let me go to too deep into that but one of the the very interesting comments from class uh the boss he was saying that to think actually in that like uh uh in terms of the installations uh and i was telling you what are the camera you know what how to create i guess in a way affordance like that in a way you know that already you are putting the position inside the people in certain position but already you you have already some you can expect something more than the people just being anywhere in the space station by creating suggesting uh affordance i guess or by designing yeah yeah in a way you can stage it stage the people by placement of the camera for example yeah yeah he was using the word staging actually yeah like how you can stage how you can make stage and make sure like then the elements are in certain ways that that you can expect some things from them already so rated the choreography is in motion lag is the same idea with the handle the already is implicit the motion in the handle right so then if you think the stage what are the installation stage what are they how are those elements placed that already proposed certain motion happening already right but it's hard to think about it with the like motion like visualization let's say or i don't know how you what's the name you use it but um is that something you want the viewers that say the dancers use this kind of visualization to do what like is that something you want to but then it becomes like a choreography but yeah but it kind of changes movement that's the thing does they think exactly like is it is it an artistic thing you know is it like is it it's an artistic uh artifact when you go in that direction and then uh or is this something that actually you want the people to utilize and and i think this is somehow how i see the installation that we made in right somehow it has this it has this this implicit affordance or it has this it is something it's a tool because it uh it's just some it's something that people can use um it's not a performance yeah but uh it's a tool but you kind of expect people to use it in a specific way not that good but because we know the practice that's what we want to show yeah um but i think in this case um if we talk about like because basically it's a is this is about data visualization and it's data visualization but then it's about like the mathematical representation of the body in space right and uh and then is yeah there's a question um yeah yeah so i would say like first question is like is that something like if this is affordable something to think about or not or is it if it's not then but then you have to have like is the avoidance the the right word because that implies that you want the users to see it use it in a specific way but then if it's but you can see it in a different way like you can still keep it open while um you just give it like a hint like some guide to to you know use the visualization in different ways but if it just tells you that you know okay the point was circling like this as a circle then there's not much that you can learn from it i don't know if that's right word i don't know what i think is important is like to do like like two things one is like practical thing on the technical thing which is basically what i'm spending most of my time um but you need the reflection you need the reflection otherwise like you need to know we need to think what are you doing um yeah and why i mean it's just basically yet to reflect in different ways uh that's why for me was i really want to talk i really i need to talk because i don't know why so many things at the same time like from different place one of the other things that i think is very interesting somehow and i think for me but also for us to think as a tool or as a something that affords something to be to be something else it's like uh when we think of these problems of data representation of motion capture um i think it has to deal a lot with or a few of the examples that you will find in the internet are about topography i mean like the study of yeah the graffiti is how topography is is this the visual representation of the earth somehow i think somehow so cartography deals with this and you won't you will not you will you won't think of topography as a 2d space but you always think in a 3d space um yeah and then you have these examples very often of like waves uh then you put it uh that's what in a way what i was trying to build is like the first to have like a two-dimensional audio spectrum and then after having some audio spectrum put it in a 3d space and then expand it and then create something that is that it has volumetric feeling coming from a 2d major like and now the analysis will be just in x and y position doing audio sampling um and so yeah so this idea of like so putting there are a lot of these examples about it has to deal with topography and with uh with the with three-dimensional space and there should be something there i don't know exactly what but there should be something there about uh some yeah yeah i don't know what to what to say about the topography but i like what you said about showing 3d i don't know like representation through the 2d map to the space basically you draw something to represent 3d which i think is quite interesting and maybe it's relevant because you're not adding so many like more and more things to show like you're not using 3d to show 2d but it's you're using 2d flat surface to use to visualize what's you know where the mountain is and stuff like that that you cannot that's supposed to be 3d but you're showing it in 2d which is interesting i think this this is a this is a nice comment because i was thinking for instance like one of the ideas i thought is like to have just a balance i saw it also for some example the internet like to have them kind of bars you know like these bars that you will think like so then you have just the x y and z x y and set position three bars just moving up and down uh and then applying kind of the same approach like in real time these ones maybe next next to it uh in time uh during the whole time what is the average uh but that's for reason that's a really simple approach that um that some then kind of like i'm questioning like oh is this enough because then i started thinking maybe you have to do more particle systems or these kind of particles and particles of particles kind of things but since the goal i mean since the dance and the is i mean the goal is not to to create a 3d beautiful something but is to uh create something that uh can be understood somehow you know it has to be it has to be able to understand now i have feel like i have to like make kind of a collection database of all these visualization projects which one like just just collect all these things i know and like map it out i mean like just as a list i want to make a list now maybe i spend next one hour to do that let's say digital id projects normally like the visualization projects like the projects that deal with visualization of body or motion tracking oh yeah at least do it and then like to like to create like the great lag at least well of all of these projects yeah let's do it please share it i just keep it for myself no um yeah i want i want to say like uh go through the trackable qualities as the yes as finishing the the chat yeah so i'll just or do you have other things to say because i thought no no no i think yeah then uh thanks for watching i just say go through and then i'll just close the video so thank you for watching i i want to say that i wanted to say this thing for because i really we haven't done the public chat for some time i think so and practices like from next next coming two weeks we will start yes we'll we'll practice again so i will see if i will see floor i will see floor soon also [Music] you will see floors sooner good night okay is that good okay so trackable qualities uh center of mass bounding box kinetic sphere reach circularity linear quality of form linear quality of movement level travel intensity openness stance contact area balance sturdiness negative space avoided space texture of movement gaze parallel with parallelism joint angles initiation of movement degree of interruption alignments that's it i'll send it to you i'll i'll put the link in the in the video as well yes put the link and please send it to me yeah bye very cool", "jEY7U66sMsA": "hello recording process so it's the first chat like public chat in 2020 22 22. we were talking with auto to do some practices on the installation that we put and i and the dance house just off dusseldorf so it will be a micro practice of 15 minutes yeah i guess i don't have time to upload this uh today before we do it so i guess we already you already see it on the youtube channel that's funny all because that's uh for us it's our future that's what this will be the future but like people will see this after you upload what will be upload first this of the price of the practice i don't know but it's not gonna be so much of a difference anyways it's done as like the time you watch it it's already done but in our time in our you know sandbox inside zoom it's not done yet i mean it's going to happen in the future yeah yes so i guess we have tons of things to talk about but i want to tell me about like your yeah so many things i mean it's been a while since last chat like last chat was like in did we do in december like the the one we upload i don't know maybe we might have signed it oh i don't know when was the last time we upload no idea no well jim now otto went to japan and he's back in in in japan while you were in japan yeah yeah we did we did yeah we even did with annie right that was uh that was before you go into japan i know you were in japan already no i think i i don't know i thought i was in japan i was in japan i think ah true yes and also with uh with julia yeah yeah you know crazy so tell me what what did you saw like in that you thought it was interesting in the installation so maybe we should like briefly talk about what the installation is probably we talked about it in the last chat i mean the chat like because we were developing it so we made a website where you can uh see hydra sketches like how we do practice but it's automated with some texts that we wrote and so that's kind of the main thing for the installation that is projected on the screen on the wall and uh what else we have two computers both are running the same web page but also when i'm there i set up light lab that connects to computers so it's really like replicating how we would drip before uh the practice but we're not there exactly oh whoa it's censored okay sorry is it me no no what is that it's just my blurry no this is my blurriness no no no thank you what is in the camera can i can i interact or maybe not no this is the thing you see this is the video ah it's a video i see i see the video yeah yeah no i thought you opened the webpage but we could do it too but yeah i mean so where are we now uh okay so there's a web page you can open it i will put the link as well um even with your phone you can open it perhaps uh oh no but that's yeah this would do something no i don't know where the camera is do you see yourself jorge that is it is it reflection no it's a reflection it's just uh you didn't know it's the camera yeah okay there you go i know yeah it's me there we go okay anyways and you can tap the like trigger different effects oh no that's something else anyways um so that's that but um to have the how do you say like the idea of the practice we also installed or you know just put some props i mean basically nail polish um next to the computer so what's interesting is even if people are not interested so much in technological element aspects they can just paint their nails while they see something while they see something on the wall that is doing that is changing exactly and for those who dare to do something they go there and they they start playing and for us i thought it was maybe it's relevant that we wanted to do three things with that is like we wanted to give a sense of what a practice is also to give visibility so in a way that is understandable um what we do and to show the potential right i think we talk of these three things so like to show something that is simple but it can become something more complex in the future exactly so it's not like we try to show everything but but it's more about the glimpse of the practice so that's that's me yeah this is what i was talking about with the nail polish and there's a camera that's filming the nail polish shots of and then we use light and then we use live lab that was one of the tools that we use to create a composition yeah this yeah you can see in one of the screens live lab you can see the person is a visitor is painting her nails it's funny because somebody's sitting in front of a computer and just painting the nails huh yeah i know this is someone else's installation and let me go back to this this is someone else's it was funny because the opening like uh stefan uh the artistic director of dan's house he was giving a talk and like as if like that was a stage for him all right it was very funny but that's very nice that he used the space there this shot yeah someone showed me her nails this is my nails that's it oh yeah this is really nice um i don't know if the video plays oh yeah like people showing the nails and the hands in front of the camera it's funny the hands yeah so that's that that's funny there is this open post thing like to motion track and there is one there is one sketch that is about hands wait maybe we can we can do that like just for a second to see if it works i think there was anton from motionbank uh [Music] so i we were in this ccl version of uh in berlin uh one week ago i was there and then anton was there now it was not there because he was like doing his installation thing um i wish i could but unfortunately well as this this version was very strange because they just they invited students so it was a very it was very strange i think but it was full of input i say what it was good it was the input the amount of input that they have uh i think everybody had a headache every day because they were complaining but it was very interesting input uh but there was one thing it was called i think anthon created this thing called talk to the hand maybe let me see if my chrome i haven't still talked to the hand hyper fail yes and i think if you go there normally we should be able to use it at the same time wait do you want to share screen i send the link yeah so that's my hand i think like if we if you go to that link like your hand should appear there that's what he made okay oh yeah that's your hand i don't know if my computer is fast oh no i can't do it because uh on windows i have to i cannot use the camera at the same time with different programs but i see your hand so like i think what he made what he made is like he created this thing like uh so he's not collaborative and he created his collaboratives so so that's his hand i mean he's kind of frozen now i don't know why because i think i'm why is it frozen because maybe yeah i was working again yeah second hand he's not taking my second hand no yeah but so what he did he just he put normally this project there is a github repository where you can just eat your hand but i guess what he made was to be able to join this uh hand hands party or something he was joking like it was just fun to like just uh share this because i see the people they reflect of somebody just start playing their hands right that's the first thing that we somebody will do is just play with their hands yeah um this is nice is this an auto who is that yeah i just closed webcam on zoom and that's it's running on the yeah yeah it's capturing my hand but it's kind of blurry i don't know why i mean not blurry but the color is not really opaque okay so there's that yes so that's that that's really nice i actually had the same idea with postnet so you just appear as a skeleton on the web page and you know other people appear at the same time always with the but the problem always with the bodies that you need the distance now true true that's yeah that's it um so that's that um at the moment so i'm doing i'm doing the internship with motion bank this week i i um normally i will be there the first week of february like for and then i stay for two months and during this period here i think i'm trying to research about uh the mapping so that the mapping process is what you do in technology is when you take data from a motion capture system and those that data is transforming to some numbers that are useful in a place like for visualize something or to make it to make useful those numbers um yeah like mapping the input to the output which could be visuals or sound or inflatable or whatever yeah so i think the straightforward example that you have on mapping is then you have uh with motion capture systems or like with a camera then you start tracking something but then to make it visible then you convert that into a circle like and then you create a skeleton uh yeah um so but that's like an anthropo anthropomorphic way of always to representing data that is mostly it is used in a skeleton um [Music] for the dancer of the choreographer to know what is happening to have a reference um but i think i'm interesting to see like more the the non-anthropomorphic way to representing that data so instead of being the skeleton to then let it be something else um and try to stay so basically the mapping process happens but now to say is like there is input so there's a camera recording movement there is mapping there is the process of transforming this into something so there's input there is a mapping and the third part is an output that will be visualizing an skeleton or something else or changing the sound in different ways and i think i'm interesting to stay more in the in the in the second step uh technically but also conceptually i'm trying to understand a little bit better but try to i i think i need to i'm interested in in thinking from a dance point of view what can that be uh yeah yeah and yeah yeah because i mean i would add uh in case of our practices we don't have i mean we don't use sensors but even if like how to say it like uh basically there's no connection between input and output like we do something we do some movement and it well it appears on the camera as uh hydra whatever thing but it's not that there's a mapping like it's it in a sense yes but it's not that we try to narrow down what the body is doing or you know like not not that we are measuring anything and and transform it to something else it's more about oh we are transparently yeah yeah i think but i think what i found interesting in this conversation and that really helped i think it will help me is because it seems to me that easily can explode this into something that is very technical you know then you start just really i was seeing this example for instance where people were using a tree and in the tree they tried to just uh use the leaves as a as a particle system like let me just not make it complicated i think easily can just become very technical the discussion um in terms of graphic representation of this data um and i think what i what i found interesting is because it's about the translation it's about the transformation of the data into something that becomes visual let's say and i i think we we do translate we do so what we are not sending is like motion capture data but we send compositions like we send basically uh pixels constantly right we send in a practice we will do very often is then i will start doing something i create some composition we use very often to blur with the background or a chroma key or a luma key and then we will use um the image of the other person so then we distort ourselves and then the other person and then we create this loop process often no so we are not sending data like it's not like is there is not a float number from zero to one but we send pixels and yeah i think that's the the big difference that uh how we do it is basically we don't process the data at all but if you take like motion capture it's something that is already narrowing down into smaller amount of numbers or like if you use sensors that's already like if you measure temperature if you measure acceleration that's something that is representation of something in a in a lower dimension like you only have like 10 sets of numbers let's say yeah so it's narrowing down right like to try to understand or like to yeah to understand what does that mean like what yeah and then you have to expand it again as a you know visual or sound or whatever but that process is like you know you have like less data as as a result of motion capture and then you expand it with you know how you draw it or how you use the data yeah but it's true like because what it happens is like you have motion so it comes from like an embodied thing like dance let's dance and then you will use the comp well you will start tracking some of these qualities of the motion as now to say it so that is true like it narrows down to some aspects of it like of velocity or the distance between the two hands or um but that's not the completely that's not the full dance that's just uh there are just some numbers from the recording that happens um and that again that's but now to say is like it becomes in our visualizations like so then it visualizes into something um like i'm using a particle system so many small particles that are represented in a 3d space um but i think i start feeling very very very fast like is it seems to me that i guess is i need to use more like a clean approach or i don't know like because i have a recording let's say of one hour of seven dancers uh so and each dancer has i don't know what is it called effect the one that like dancers are running around is it i think it's called it's here between us yeah yeah it's the yep actually maybe i can just put this this is something that can be open group motion data this is would be nice to see it i think i already uninstalled it i will maybe i will just share this screen for a second yes i think i already have there is this there is this website um oh yeah library there is this library from motion bank i think the idea that they want to put different i mean they have a lot of motion capture and they would like to put more but at this point we can use this tree and the one that i'm working on is uh effect yeah yeah yeah sorry to say something but it's just so funny to say uh they were a haze piece again because that's the first thing i did at the ccl i joined in new york and uh that was that was very something special to me anyways and that's yeah and so this one this one in particular so the one that i'm using it uses this uh app that you can also download um where you can deliver this i think it's called what's called effect data player and that will then that will play this two four five dancers and each of dancers have their own [Music] um color and whatever what i will do what i do is then i will i will select what do i want to receive in our software so i will select i select one person so amber the purple one and then i said what do i want from that so in this case i want the left the right hand not say just like i'm just using one point and then i will then open then i will receive that in other software like this one and then i will it should make a tutorial video i was thinking that and then here from here i can do i can see i can receive the the data of amber like yeah and with that i kind of start representing i guess that represents the x y z and rotation this will resp this represents like x x y c and these are quaternion numbers that at the first time i heard of this it was only in uh there like in the ccl but apparently if i'm not wrong is like our that's our reference in the space this is like x y and z uh but so can you maybe say in short what are quaternion numbers because maybe alpha is not super clear um yes so yeah basically that represents the rotation in the space in 3d space so you know in this 3d space it's not just like this rotation but you can have this and like all combined it's very confusing so someone decided to use okay let's say unless we use uh quaternion and that's like the standard for 3d graphics and more mathematics as well it was very not very superficial i hope it works yeah anyway so yeah i don't want this to just take more time on this um maybe can i party those forces like the issues yeah i think i can do this yeah i mean the good thing is like if you parse the data with quaternion then i guess touch designer already takes that i mean probably you don't have to use it for now but uh if you want to animate something like a banana 3d model or something in touch designer you can use that rotate it yeah i mean for me like for now like what i was doing there is like i'm just taking the x y actually because i was using all the colors i use just the x position so i'll just take into the head of each of this each of these colors i will just take the x so i will be uh anything that it goes anything that it goes to the left it will decrease the value anything that is goes to the right will increase the value and then i will use all the colors so basically just from each of the dancers i will take their head and one in their motion that will pass to the left i will let the particles react to something but yeah see [Music] this is x maybe wow okay this is going crazy um no something is happening yeah and the nice thing about this effect player is that you don't have to load data on your like sketch like this touch designer you don't have to do it like load files and you know play back with whatever frame rate and stuff like that but it just takes care of everything and just spits the osc messages yeah what is practical is you can see the the dancers here right right yeah it also has the playback head so you can change to the beginning or if you want to work on the same specific time stamp you can do that on that player so but this is this is what i like so i'm i think like for these two weeks that i'm in belgium i'm trying to work on to find representations of a particle system but then i try to find a balance i try to then make it technical but at the same time they make something that i can use like like choreographic thinking in the in the process of yeah i'm trying to find a project from maria she did basically uh sure yeah this piece that she created uh two years ago almost because she was she was basically producing this uh vr piece during the ccl where they uh started using the effect layer um i think i didn't optimize for video but but this one is like more like a straightforward representation of bodies from the b so you can see these avatars in the in the video like five five performers which simply like is a mapping from the um the effect dance piece are they using the same at the recording it seems to me that the same recording yeah so basically it's it's straight out from that player and it's more about like creating the space and these avatars so it's very different from what you said something i did was i think was cool it was just kind of like a yeah kind of mistake this is what i actually i'm gonna show to florian more is that i did what is this actually um [Music] motion [Music] um first okay i was a video image output yeah do you want to share it or what what are you yes yes sorry uh yeah i was not sure but now just now i found it wait so is this thing this is actually the dish this is actually the real footage yeah so what i did here is i i use bdmx to overlap both things using there is this this visualization is made by christian one of the people who work in motionbank he used 3gs to represent spaghetti yes and then there are different things so but what i did that i found interesting is for some reason so of course like it's not exactly the the length of course like the length is not the same in both places because you can have a [Music] like wait me first like all this information comes from from [Music] there is a project that is called between us and it's very they explain different things and from there there is one place where you find the the recordings but of course the recording they don't have a specific same time from the 3 gs visualization so you have to manually in a way map them like to put them together uh like shifting like a time yeah but like manually so yeah so it's not practical but i i think and this is a recording of like more than one hour so i think after a while when i so i was coming back and forth to check then you have a slight offset right then maybe one hour it becomes something visible uh but i thought it was interesting at the end uh because then sometimes it's like become it becomes so there are basically two things that are being uh blend constantly the representation and the dance but then in a way then you can start almost like djing like and then sometimes you let some of the motion you stop yeah you stop one of the videos so it becomes like a third thing what do you mean stop the video i will stop so i have basically two videos the they represent the 3gs in the left and the other one to the right you see there for instance like i stopped one of the videos the 3d gs is stopped oh and this is is there a vdmx on the top i'm using vdmx normally in this i don't i don't see like i just see the the quick time yeah no i mean this is not this is a recording of what i did so but okay using two different channels and then it's a you see for instance like there are three dancers but in reality there are two dancers i mean well it depends on which is the reality is yeah yeah so and then i said it wasn't and there was like a there was a mistake if you hear there is a straightforward representation but then because of the accumulation of this offset becomes something different and i thought it was interesting then just to then play with that almost like a bj with that then uh sometimes you let one play then sometimes you let the two stop i mean that you you do this uh it becomes a third thing is it on its own i was like always interested in like yeah basically vijaying movements but you know how we can get rid of or not get rid of the original meaning but how can you make something out of by uh making something out by let's say remixing or vjing someone's video of someone's movement or dance say it again because i think it's interesting [Music] just like you know chop remix like let's say dance piece but that's not dance piece but let's say someone's you know uh dancing like let's say we have some kind of frontal or we can change the perspective as well that could be also interesting um [Music] thing and that's actually connected to the the post editing idea from the the installation i tried in uh in japan at the y cam that i showed you that basically like the idea of the installation i think i didn't say it in the chat the public shot but i went to visit waika and i tried this installation where you record your movement for like i don't know 15 seconds or 30 seconds and then after that you edit you add some effects you add you know like a kaleidoscopic effects or particle system with a tracking things like that but it's like you do it you can do it real time like with the buttons while you're dancing or you can do it afterwards after dancing you can um [Music] manipulate the video basically and i think that's really interesting concept like how to [Music] remix or compose something out of a dance video sorry that was long but i don't know if it was clear no other thing i don't think can you maybe repeat it like in a nutshell what you're trying to say it's hard to say uh so you record a video of a dance piece or like a that doesn't have the dance piece like you do have some kind of movement and then you so it becomes a video material and then you can do whatever with that right i mean you can just shuffle the frames or you can repeat some parts like it's like tick-tock that you edit like change speed or add effects and that becomes the composition or or the choreography in itself this uh editing process the editing process yeah editing process let's say yeah yeah yeah yeah okay i see how yeah i really yeah i relate that somehow it's how i try i try to i would like to think somehow uh in in the mapping process that yeah i see what i mean yeah yeah because mapping is actually not something i never thought of but when we think about mapping movements or like sensor data we never uh oh we we rarely work with the time domain because i mean you can use the data from the past but you don't have the data from the future so you're really restricted with how you can use time in a real-time process and also something that because i was my in my experiment like i was using at the beginning an accelerometer so the x y and z position for and and the dancer was doing things but i think what is difficult to work in real time with mapping i mean trying to do this research is that you need to still make things visible or understandable so you still you need to um like while you do things in real time with these sensors easily the things can just go nothing understandable like if the process of mapping is like basically to limit which numbers how big are how small are these numbers uh when you are in real time situation then you will have a lot of noise there are a lot of things that you cannot control and if at the end you need to represent that uh like for my case for instance will be easier uh then to work with data that always will be represented in the same way then i can change my decision like my choreographic thinking in the way how i choose the the mapping to be applied because i need to have a stable say and a stable recording that is repeating for me to check afterwards yeah what does that mean right so i think in the mapping in the mapping there is you need to make sense like uh yeah i don't know like if yeah otherwise like when when i show what i was doing in the particle system i don't know exactly what was happening and then the just the no the particle was just going in some direction because basically i did not map the numbers so easily can just become something that is not understandable and therefore you cannot work on that um okay i mean oh yeah uh maybe that the problem is that yeah because you cannot repeat so it's hard to to iterate if you work with real-time data then like you have to really have to do the same movement again and again yeah yeah so and it's i guess it's possible but it just will demand more it just brings many things that you don't want to deal with you know yeah work in real time because at the end like in the process you want to make that's what i would mention there should be a sweet spot where so if i want to work with abstractions i want so i don't want the skeleton just on the skeleton to be represented but also i know that i want some abstraction that is still somehow could be understandable so it should be a sweet spot between something that is understandable but also something that is abstract and that is that's what i was mentioning to in one uh in the in mia's conversation but he uh when i talk with him um for me it should be a sweet spot between how much how how much abstract can be uh right if the case is to still understand something like in i think at least for what i'm doing in this 3d representation of a particle system i still need somehow to create some my aesthetic purpose if i will compare with a practice i'm away from this purpose right yeah because you mentioned practice like i i want to share i think i said to you or maybe i wrote to you but a really interesting conversation with uh professor kubota he's he's really active in live coding in japan and we had some conversations about light coding and movements and of course like we talked about like uh kate uh kate cgio she's i think one of the papers you had uh has her uh paper as well but she's doing a lot with um movement and light coding but that's very like like there's like a strong mapping between the code and movement or this is like a relation like this always like you move according to the code or you go against the code but there's like a reference a code as a reference to the movement but then what we do as a practice is very different because there is no direct connection between code and how we move and that's like indirect because how we appear on the screen might affect how we move but um there is no logic and then what he what uh professor gupta was saying is it sounds more like uh bhutto where um there's this brutal notation that is either wow i didn't know so the interesting thing about brutal notation is it's very different like it sounds like lava notation or something that is like structured thing but it's it's it's very different because basically the founder uh [Music] he described movements um as you know text as some kind of analogy um using some you know something from nature animal or some stories and then he named this movement uh yeah there's a name for the age movement so it's not very structured i mean it how they say it so there's there's a dictionary of movements but they're associated with like stories and not like how you move it's not really descriptive okay and that's like the practice we do is probably close to that yeah that's funny because you mentioned that i think that the annotate it seems to me like there are more like annotations how you move during the during a period not specifically what you're doing but some meta information so made the information of what is happening yeah yeah so it's like closer to like more like observation rather than notation yeah yeah i mean to be honest like i still have like when i think in in because i like when i think in the internship and then the it's a bit still like blurry for me like how how i can still i think i'm interested in that exactly in how in the translation process um uh but i don't want to then to get to complete too technical but also and also i don't want to stay too conceptual uh it has to be something in between um or both or yeah yeah i get it and i think that's something that for me it's i feel it's like where i started and like about like you know like anything it doesn't have to be like movements but any kind of interactive thing i always at first i was thinking like you know you get the input and how you convert to the output and that was like i was stuck with that for quite a lot of time and now i try not to work with it because it to me it always ends up something technical and that's really not interesting i mean technically interesting but artistically not interesting i felt and that's why like i like the practice because we don't do that but but now you've brought this uh product this topic again i think it's interesting for me to revisit what it is what is mapping process and what can i do with it like should i just avoid this process or can i do something from very different perspective becoming not too technical yeah i am i think what i found interesting of this process that i'm doing is like is to normally i'm very interested in working in real time but working real time yeah is similar to the the practice in the sense that you can you cannot stop and go back or go after i mean you cannot in real time then you are just in the moment right so i i think i like normally i will not doing this process that i'm doing now i'm not so interested normally in in taking or yeah doing what i'm doing right now normally that's not what i will do and yeah that's interesting it's a bit annoying to be honest but but i think it's but i think it's interesting um yeah i feel like it's it's interesting when it when we start to think it in a different way like if we think because when we think about mapping it's very technical or systematic that we know that data is incoming as digits and we have to move something either particles or dots or whatever with that data so it's like naturally it becomes really technical uh thinking but can we do let's say queer mapping what would we career mapping no but i think that's that that's what i appreciate of the conversation because of the um yeah because the conver the conversation has to stay queer yeah and if i will just yeah that's what basically what i was trying to find with these papers is like to find trying in a way like to talk basically about embodiment it's basically about doing an embodiment in the mapping process um yeah so yeah so then the company so the conversation like the this it refreshes uh yeah so more to come yeah but i think we should close we should close here and like we will meet uh we do a practice of 15 minutes oh yeah true uh yeah i have to well i don't have to go now now but i have to start thinking about going get going i just wanted to find the documentation for the [Music] of the thing that i did with deborah hayes [Music] dataset to close maybe okay the layout is completely broken but so that's what i did at the first ccl i joined and what is what is it what what is so is something pretty sound what is the the the hard work there yeah so there's this uh device that uh i kind of helped a building that i had uh it's like uh like a force feedback device that you normally they they made it for attaching it to the mouse like computer mouse and then you know you get the like it will pull the mouse to get give you the force feedback but i just used it as a kind of plotter like 2d plotter and that movement is coming from deborah hayes piece because that piece only had 2d like almost like 2d uh data like where the dancer is in xy space and then the sound that what the the dust is just something that it every time passes it will move a little yeah so this this plotter has like a little pin uh attached to it so that it just like you know scatters the particles every time it passes yeah but then in terms of like mapping the process it's very simple because it's just based on the dancer's position like this moving and answers position so it's not like i try to convert something in the technical sense it's very straightforward mapping but the idea came from the choreographic thinking of debra hay that she was choreographing this piece for the human cells which is kind of funny i i still find it's funny but uh basically it's not like she's not interested in humans yeah so she's not interested in what you can do with your body with your you know um like how you move with your limbs like you with your arms with your legs because it's that's like limited let's say so she was choreographing for the whole cells because then you have more freedom because there are more cells than you know the joints of the body let's say that was that's what's her idea to have more possibility um [Music] and yeah so that's why like i thought what if i work with the particles but not 3d particles or like computer in the computer graphics but three recording processes okay maybe we should close here yeah so yeah so basically internet is kind of good no but i think yeah but at the end is just uh i think i will just go to the minimum i was think thinking more like actually to make more complicate this process but i like i think i will just like also just uh i'll just one coordinate and just do that a research process so just like just one people you know like more than uh almost like a scientific like report of what happens you know when i take exposition of this period of time uh and then change the same positive the head then change the head of each of the dancers what happened is it's happening something different but to try to analyze that i need to go really down until okay from the 35 points i'll just take one point and then it will be just x in my x y set and then i can say something about it yeah sorry i was saying that because it says it will in a way reflect what you show [Music] yeah like yeah it's not always good to have more data that's that's for sure right so i guess we're closing because because okay so it's it's getting very glitchy this is the this is the internet is not yeah the internet doesn't work but uh see you at 6 45 6 45 yes yep ciao", "zuzgKYgKEzM": "good night hello good night i'm going to sleep now yeah man hello everyone i guess this is chad this is public all right right this is i have to wear suit and tie no um oh the question is not like questions of all day it happened today now it has a the day it happened already yes and i'm just my glory you're so behind yeah i'm in my glory uh well you know the last time i like because sometimes like i'm like around 12 like the last because i want to i propose to now to do this chat and i'm like 12 around 12 30 working and i thought like should i send something to now too like you know like if you want to chat but maybe it's like six it's like 70 in the morning for you if his 12th year is eight already for a year right oh like a midnight his age yeah so maybe next time i will just try you don't have to answer if you answered because maybe you want to do it yeah it really depends on the day but it's also tricky like at night sometimes like when i go out most likely i come back really late like when i go to tokyo for example because it's it's quite far and you know if i have dinner with someone and then it's most likely i come back around 11 00 around midnight i'm trying my new lights i was thinking like i should really look for those like nice lights because there's like a district where they sell electronics [Music] which ones i mean just like there's a place where they sell leds and you know i should look for things like that if they have it i mean of course you can get it that on aliexpress or whatever but just to yeah it's nice to do some shopping yeah but this this one i found very just handy to carry because they're very small okay let's talk about business so the last time the last time we talked with uh it's weird i was thinking today that is weird because we used to if you think for reason when we were in buff like which is super this is very strange think about it when we were in buff almost every conversation that we have it was recorded like serious conversations you know like work-related conversation and we were in the same space right for 10 days that's that's that's and if you think right now we the last time for some time the la we have been just every time we meet online we are working on installation so we are not doing a chat we are just working because we you see what i mean is weird that the la when we were in physical presence then we were recording constantly and now that we are online we're not ready and we're not doing it separately maybe sometimes yeah yeah yeah i thought it's the workflow is a little bit hard when like well i i would say not necessarily we have to be in the same space but if you're in the same time zone of course it's easier um yeah right now it's a little bit hotter but you know but that's what it is we we knew it yeah but it's more related because of the energy for instance for sure yeah um but let's talk about like i wanted to talk about yeah the so then we're working with the in the installation that we're proposing for dance house in january normally it's not announced yet so you know something like that by the way yesterday i asked uh also directly in an email to motionbank is this yale gonna happen although i just need to have this confirmation like yeah these festivals anyway so we are working for this festival in in dance house in germany and we're working in a hybrid installation way of the best practices so it's an interface it has a it's a web interface with some physical thing i guess um and then one of the things that i that i i propose this stuff would notice because um it seems like um also com as a part of uh the last week i we applied some months ago for our um and our grand nars electronics and we passed through the process of selection until the final with so we were just part of the fort at the end but we didn't were selected and the feedback that they gave us uh was that uh the application was too much i mean that was my translation of that is that it was too much focus on the technology and the research of the technology because i was proposing to research the deep space which has like a full immersive ak monitors all around the space and motion capture systems so it was that was my that my focus i guess and in some house they were saying that uh there was some lacked lack of adapting or artistic concept or something [Music] and so i mentioned this because uh [Music] yeah so basically is that it seems to me that so we have developed a language so what i will call like like a new art medium or a media on its own we speak of these things um but then the question is then what do we want to if we if we have developed or created a language what do we want to say with the language or what do we what we don't want to say with the language um sorry i i was really distracted because you said about ours and then i was like oh i i heard that i got notification for the iclc the conference and it's weird like they said they wrote to me an email that it's updated on the author console on the like on the web platform where you submit the paper and i went there and i just checked now and like yeah i think we we got in also the one with floor but we can we can or you know we can talk about it now or later um because when i see of what what is that are you talking about so it's also the web uh installation that we proposed that uh um like as a part of the conference to show it ah the one the one in chile another one in particular no no no no it's a it's a life coding thing it's not uh i say that we are still waiting for i think and that one you have the access to the contact yeah platform it's like yeah it's so confusing anyways but actually it's nice that uh they also wrote us review i mean the you know comments some feedback yeah uh is this ours yes uh i don't know if it's it's okay to say it yeah i think it's okay like yeah that will be nice because we are talking about these things so there's only one section that has the like long text other parts are like you know is it okay or not and they say yes or no okay so there's this question please provide some comments on the relevance of the paper to be presented this can be in the form of the expectation of discussion paths to be unfolded during the actual presentation comment this is an interesting proposal which prevents an archive of materials produced through interactions via online between two artists they use different technologies and produce a hybrid outcome which constitutes or constitutes a sort of log of their activities remarkable is the conceptual aspect which states the notion of a queer form of conversation between technology and bodies since this is a strong point in the proposal i would suggest to provide the links to make the work accessible through our conference website in the same at the same time a suitable text for the visitors it will be great to get the text both in english and spanish port of war yes that's this is nice it's good i think yeah yeah that's very nice uh there's another one uh another reviewer an interesting proposal in its way of approaching action art and digital happening in a queer form the use of text chat seems to me a way of approaching the written code as a way to activate that pixel space and in its limits puts in puts it in dialogue with a like one i don't really understand but you know it's a it's a positive feedback and i think it's good very complimenting people get the idea of you know the queer form of conversation between technologies and bodies which is i think it's really cool part yeah which kind of relates to what you're just saying i think yeah i'm thinking that for for me like i'm thinking that like i always i think i feel like in between uh do we have to say something you know like do we want do we have to say something or do we want actually not to say something um i'm constantly between these two things but at something that i was not thinking too much like uh when i was considering the last week is that even if you don't want to say something uh then it has to be clear for the viewer if it's to share we're looking we're talking about here not what we call the sandbox but it's just the space to share you know like say and the the interface of a text or a workshop could be have different uh or the hybrid performance different forms there is not the sandbox which is the sandbox is great and the space that people like olivia or people who are somehow with in knowledge or or this micronics uh target group that we said uh or people who code but also maybe are interested in motion or in digital art they can go and understand and find interesting that's the best that's the practices that we do and we should keep it like that because it's it's it's just it works but then the other aspect in trying to communicate with other people they don't uh so the other like an installation on its other ones then i think it has to be clear what is about if we don't want to say something so if if the problem is like do we want to say something or if so or we don't want to say something then the this idea that we don't want to say something it has to be also clear uh not not mixed uh you see what i mean well that's what i'm thinking excellent in blending something that is not really clear like if uh all we said when we saying something is trying to then to have some clear approach then we define what is that approach but then it's clear that is it goes to one direction uh there will be like not then the natural process will be somehow doing that i guess uh or then denying somehow to have some statement as a it's almost like because then we deny to say something then that becomes the statement somehow that the denying say something yeah like that and so then going back i think maybe to the installation for instance i was thinking this idea of i don't know yesterday i also went for a walk and then i see these installations they were in the park like where like christmas lights but now became the the city investing create like small light installations around some path pathway and then you see them and you see that some of them they're nicer than other ones like right away from aesthetic point of view and but also there are some ones and in a way that i don't know they can do it they do a little bit more than just i don't know it's just i think it's difficult when well i if you think uh everything in the interface for instance like and we want to say it i think we want the people to understand or the people to get something right um is difficult to make from the interaction when they interface something uh yeah something out of it more than just going and playing with filters and going away like you know you know for instance like if there's something like just some text you put some i don't know a poem or something already i mean this is not it's just an example you know already you put you you really you're telling the people around what they have to think right you you put them close to a place that they have to think something um [Music] but also we mentioned in the development of the practice and in the in the text that i wrote for my masters then i then i wrote that isn't conscious that other we don't want to interfe intervene with what the people have to think right but that's yeah sure yeah like how we did with the like long streaming for example it's not that we want them to watch it like seven hours straight but like they can come in and out to find what they like or not but then yes it is i guess like there are two different things that we're uh yeah like for the installation i think we are probably taking a different approach or we could take ideas from this uh how to say known imposing way of showing stuff but um yeah but i don't know how but i i think that's possible you know like it's not mixing two things but we just like take ideas from how we did with the with the streaming or the practices yeah i mean yes yeah that's true like i was like also trying to go to my notes and because there is so much like because what i'm talking about like here and that was part of what i'm uh i proposed to to to do this chat is that somehow that we go back and we start thinking what is that we want to like say yeah i think that's what what is that we want to say um [Music] and i think in a process for instance with installation we we could do uh this parallel process of like developing and trying to keep an eye on reflecting how to yeah how to say something with the uh with the interface but i just started to think something i don't know if it's interesting but like at this moment like for example like i think i don't know if you if he wrote to both of us or just me that one of the person uh we sent this prototype so we sent the sport like to a few people already and one of them said you know something is not working basically like it wasn't working right now nothing was working and i was like shoot like you know when i saw it like i was like yeah we have to test a lot of devices and make it you know solid just like how the web development works you know it's it's really hard but so that was kind of in my head uh for the whole day because today is already close to ending in japan um so i had this for some time um and the funny thing was was to stephan because and stephen is the one who's in charge exactly i didn't say it but yes uh he said uh but uh but now i thought like you know what if we think in a way that it doesn't have to work but it's still interesting because like you know i like as soon as i started this like i thought you know people will use safari because you know a lot of people use mac these days and you know it's a default browser and it's really for the web developers but still people use it um but you know we can't force people to say you know use chrome use updated version of whatever but what if we make an experience in a way that it doesn't have to work but it's still you see something because that's that's that's the core of the practice in a way that you know it doesn't have to work yeah yeah i see what i mean yeah i know it's tricky but maybe there's something at least i think the way of thinking that okay i have to test every device and you know it has to work perfectly it's not how we should yeah yeah yeah this because becomes something else yeah i know while we keep the design aspect of it yeah yeah yeah which which i mean yeah exactly yeah which is one thing you begin to take away the other one exactly for sure if you are developing a website it somehow yeah it will not take away the normal steps of just developing that but it will be different to keep the the focus in making it perfect and you know like all the steps like because then all this all the energy goes to that for instance like when i was sending i i just talked with a friend of mine when uh then uh he asked like what do you want me to know what do you want what do you want to know and i said like the only thing let's say like the idea is the main idea that you move within the screen but for the rest i don't want to tell you anything because that's why we are searching for feedback basically not to tell not to tell the person [Music] what the person should do but the person just experienced that's why we're logging also these things right [Music] that's interesting because i think um i don't know if we talked but at least i think i you mentioned about big gamification because that could be a way of you know making the experience like somehow like somehow you have to achieve something you know as a video game or you know and through achieving something you discover or you have to kind of you know not force but make yourself doing something that we intend you know what i was thinking also that in somehow it seems to me that like i i have been mentioning with with to you that i see that i'm trying to find what is the gesture that we are doing what we do practice and then like basically in a way is is i will be interested in if the user can be queer with the computer in the sense uh that is not so straightforward that i come um yeah somehow let me put maybe an example that i think it simplifies this for instance if it's like the interface is as it is right now and is uh and from time to time it not really ordered there are some some words happening like uh turn around uh but there is a story going on for instance you know like so then the person in a way that is focused in doing something and at some point a computer say look to the right and then but like glitching but but basically what i'm trying to say is glitching the focus the attention that the user has with the computer you know because then then it will be queer in that sense the person is not directly moving the mouse but it will be queering uh in in some task that is trying to do somehow or find out but at the same time it's glitching his brain from things that are happening yeah and that's what like an installation i was thinking that that when i was walking yesterday that is that is this the re the place that we are working is a different one i would say it's more complicated than an installation because we don't have the physical things that you will have in an installation or let's say you have immersive space you know you can demand all these things uh at some point when i was finishing also my career and then i was like between like i feel like i want to just actually stay for a little bit in in with web interfaces and not go to the installation uh just for my school like in my final work and stuff like that and because i uh i'm bringing this back here because i'm saying that it should be possible or we are in space basically we are in the space of trying to developing how to make in a way three-dimensional this flatness of the two-dimension of the screen how we can get something more than just like i come here i do something and i go a suggestion yeah well that's what that's like exactly why i i thought about you know in the last time like something it but uh i said what if let's say the mouse is somewhere else that you have to go i mean it's not the most obvious way but you know like how do we break the way like people come to the computer and work with that because that's that's not the point that's like does the queer thing i mean i mean yeah you know what i'm what i'm talking about the queerness of the communication between the the body and the computer like uh yeah um yeah and the thing is interesting i think it's interesting because it's not something that we're gonna like find out and like you know we did this installation we developed like a unique recipe to clear the interaction with the computer for other people and the the example you said about you know move to the left or you know just giving some kind of instructions um i remember there was not project from uh lisa and daniel but the guy they were working with actually that was ccl in new york like six years ago uh but one of them was doing that exactly like something like that but not with a screen like he's like really good at ios development and basically he was making like app that yeah tells you what to do and then actually that was synchronized with other phones so well synchronized or sometimes not so it makes a choreography that's the idea if you have you know a few people reacting to the instructions together which i really liked i mean it's a different approach but you know i'm just saying as a reference yeah what i like from this like sort of idea is because i was thinking i was in something similar what was it what i i like is the idea of like the person understanding is doing something and there is something that is taking the person out from the task the person is doing so if the person has to or want to try to i don't know move because there are some buttons or some sliders so intuitively in my intuition will try to just do these things um would be nice if there is some disturbance in that cleanness like because i think disturbing them disturbing that so yeah i think somehow it could be kind of a cue like if there is some clean or good web design said or user interface uh intuitive enough and so on and at the same time because this is so clean this is what actually evil dimitrov is doing in dance by the way it's like uh uh you know the evil image for uh so yeah so this this guy he's like a star at the emperor's stance so he becomes a really good like at doing this like he's been doing drum dramaturgy because basically he just he has such a clean space uh he's so minimal that he just can't get naked and do like i don't know crazy things that are pushing let's say other person doing that or another stage will be too much but because he's so clean he can disturb the space until the limit and and i think this analogy could work for us like if we make in space that is like a clean ux somehow then the space can be disturbed and and then i think in that in that in that dialogue between the clean and disturbance i think the art let's say can can emerge from that from doing this that is very clear and this is and this is some disturbing um [Music] i see it's a bit like you know what uh like joanna is doing with the web design i think yeah maybe somehow yeah she has like really clean but you know sometimes like things are like crooked or you know something is moving that it's not supposed to move but i think i think this has to be very similar to for instance when we talk about like when floor uh flor de fuego and she works in 3d for instance in a 2d space we talk about some in my head it works in the same way because and i said that it works when she's doing almost nothing let's say it's just a taurus and or something very minimal but once many things are start happening they need these stories and become something that for me is not so interesting um so i mentioned that this is similar because um [Music] like what joanna is doing um because there is something with the screen that uh it sure is it's just it's so small like the computer is so small there's so many things around the letters are you know they're the phones are so well defined you know like that there's just the the softwares and the system is the best creator to do war processing or like to do straightforward things so it has to be lean it has to be clean right so once you um i mean very very fast you can just make a mess of it uh a very maybe a very flat mess that's the problem i think that's the difference that you have with the physical world that if you can make a mess but you have layers like you can you can perceive the layers in that mess but i think in the computer if i think for but you can you have you can have like a somehow fast you can have a mess of flattened layer no sorry i was thinking about something else uh well it's it's related uh because i was thinking this uh installation i mean this artist who graduated uh from our school i think um he's really what like he makes installations and it's so smart one of the works he did is it's just a room with an automatic door and people enter and the door closes and you notice that the door won't open that like whatever you do like it doesn't open if you come closer it doesn't open and people get panicked and then uh i think there's a sensor attracting people and the way it opens again is you don't just stay and you don't do anything and it opens again where when when how how the door opens like i i don't exactly know what's what's the condition but what i heard is like you just don't do anything like just you know just don't walk around you know just stay there and at some point it will open which is really nice because it's kind of i think it's it's also about affordance that it gives an affordance because it's an automatic door so you expect that as a sensor and you come closer and it will open but it's not something like that and it's completely in a way it's opposite that you just don't do anything and it opens which could be i mean you know i can like like directly associate with our installation we could say you know there's like bunch of buttons and it doesn't do anything for example and but if you wait for like a certain amount of time it starts doing something for example it could be interesting and it kind of fits with what we do uh although i i think it's a bit too much of a copy but you know but maybe it's nice to test no i think it's nice like i think also because we can i mean we can test them so what wait wait i want to say something about that what's what um we had like for instance like the reference uh like in the example that you give is uh it was about it works because they're i mean they're they're clear reference for somebody to to you know so you come to door you know that if you're come close to the door somehow the door will open regardless you don't even have to think about the sensor but you know that this door will open and so when you want to leave the space also you will know that normally this door should go so you have this reference in your head right but if we think for instance if you put it in the interface and with the glitches let's say um there is no reference for the person more than like the buttons are referenced the the buttons are things that the people know the slider is something that somebody will just intuitively just like try to move right um [Music] so those are common those are common denominators or they're they're things that will communicate with the person something i also think that perhaps could be just verbs like somehow if there is some text appearing in that could be there is an input where the people can just type verbs you know and then can just the people can write or wrong right screen turn uh just verbs so actions basically okay um just i was just thinking that some and then maybe say say that there is a database with some minimum some things like but then it's open for the people to start typing and that goes to the database and the database let's say there is some text coming and just with a verb from time to time showing up like turn right turn left leave the room like any of these kind of things what i think would be interesting is like to record the interaction of the user somehow uh [Music] there so then the people somehow they give some input that input is used so basically everybody who's in intervening with that installation from different places will add actions that other people will read and then just appearing as a text from time to time just a text that is almost not related whatsoever with what it would with the interface says there's a say it's exactly as what we have right now and then we have turn around jump screen left the room and so there is exactly as it is but then from time to time every 20 seconds there is one of these four words appears and disappears so uh it's up to the person who is using if the person wants to do something with the word or not or just ignoring the word because it's more like a pop-up that will it could be a pop-up like it could be this idea that you were saying like with could be a pop-up it just appears for just few seconds and disappear the person can ignore or can really try to do that and and also then that the same person can write an action maybe um i don't know about like this instruction kind of um i mean i how do i say it well i just don't like it to have like instructions showing up on the screen because for me it's hard to relate i mean i would i always think you know i'm not the person i'm gonna actually do it um and it's also you know it's it's too direct in a way like if we can do something with the interface i think it's nicer but also you know we can combine it i was thinking you know let's say if it's jump we could make the sliders or buttons jump maybe um instead of the person jumps and then you know what is um [Music] i don't know this is made too nerdy but what is if you as a person have to uh be a slider or something like that um i don't know this is this is a bit too it's not something i wanted to for this installation but yeah like i feel like if we say the instruction it feels like it kind of consolidates the web page as a webpage maybe that's what i want to say if the instructions appear yeah because then you see that oh there's a message the page is saying something to me and instead of like the idea that you said about disrupting the or like making a mess or something then it becomes no longer web page in a sense because it's not what you expect as a medium but maybe we could try what if we add like to what we have something like i think i would like to put some texture but something that is that that doesn't have to be related with anything you know that i mean what i found interesting from the idea of uh of these actions is in a way that is other people who are building this thing together like without knowing uh yeah i mean i i don't want to be a bit you know like sour or salty i don't know what it is uh but let's not think about adding the database thing because this is too much of a development and i think it's i think it's over engineering like we can do something easier wait but no it's what i was trying to do [Music] here we have um so now maybe just get out i'm trying to get out of that which is more thinking because the idea of this is that this is the public chat of your and yeah sorry um but then so then if what we're trying to do is so i'm interesting that so that people have uh the user have somehow more than just entertain the person for for a moment that the person has the the best practices it it goes that the message somehow goes right that's the idea somehow but like for example like we can think in a different way like just maybe we just make a hashtag and be like you know add something that you can post on instagram or twitter something like that instead of making the system by ourselves to hijack something because i i just feel you know like okay i i'm not gonna say it again but i just i think the the right way not just for this project actually is to like have less code like because i can think i can say okay let's make a database like this and that and you know i think it will not be an interesting uh experience for the for the user to you know like i can i like to code to be honest but like when we want to make something nice it's not we spend more time on something else and if we cheat often it's actually um better that's just my from my experience but you know so maybe like hijack something you know you have a hashtag and then if it is something that you want to share then people might share and why i don't know but i think that's also the thing like it's nice that one of your friends sent you the screenshot right like you sent me the screenshot and that was nice because but that could be nice like for reason like i don't think necessary we need to like record the videos of what could be nice if you can just take a screen shot and just share it somewhere like what if one thing is just taking a screenshot and it creates a page from all the people who are doing that yeah i mean yeah i have mixed feeling about i don't know why i i don't want to be overly like critical but uh like like this is like of course i thought about you know taking screenshot or like snapshot but then at the same time i don't want to make this experience as a photo booth or instagram feel yeah yeah that's different but i i i totally agree that there should be something that people can contribute yeah yeah yeah something that people can take out of it yeah um something where everybody in a way can see together like they're part of one thing but maybe it's just about making a tool you know like this installation not just you know one time you have fun but it somehow becomes a tool that people can use i mean that's a little bit a bit of a stretch but yeah i think like they will be watching too much like if it becomes naturally like that yeah but but then you know like also this time like we don't have to have everything for this installation i mean this is just a first thing and i guess yeah i think we should prioritize something and that yeah like the first thing we were talking about like disrupting the interface or like having a queer conversation that's something that we can wait but this is something what if that because i think i still like i like the idea that there's some text that comes from time to time so what if we what what if from the interest that we have perhaps we can take texts from yeah and then just from time to time there is almost like yeah yeah wait i have like two ideas one is like it's almost like a banner like a it's like um a carousel you know like a carousel javascript that is passing like something that is you know like a car wrestler this thing that is it just shows and then the next one the next one okay uh or the other one there is just not really it's more like random in time like when it happens you know there is not really a clear inter interval but it just appears from time to time and there is some text um yeah i think i kind of like that idea that just we put some text from time i think that could work and and also as a promotion you know i mean it's just if it's things from that we have greeting and um we can use we can use material that we have um yeah that could be interesting yeah from time to time to see and then the intention of that somehow is like the disturbs i i still want to explore a bit like you know something happens when people don't do anything or maybe like even we have like dummy buttons that doesn't do anything and then you know or like it doesn't show anything at first you know it looks like broken and then you have to wait for something to happen because that gives like you know i'm just thinking about how people attend to the computer which we want to break and how can we do that and the one can be the text but also what if we try to create design and interaction but still it's not you know it's it's not something that people don't get it maybe some people don't get it but if we have a few people get it i think it's good so wait so i'm trying to take a conversation out again like uh but so do do we need like in the practice in in general do we need to have so the design is necessary in the practice in in installation in this case for instance like to have some design is is relevant i mean as you said you know even if there's no design we have to make sure that there's no design it and so it has to be designed yeah exactly yeah yeah yeah yeah so it's because working that when the when the work working with the interfaces with web development is because it's so concrete that like if you think for reason in poetry that the words like they have is there is so much space to not yeah it's what i'm trying to say like with working with with interfaces and it's the same thing that i was trying to say with what joanna is doing or working with typography or i think design is that the layers in a way are so well defined or uh how to say this yeah i don't know i think that let's let's see something i'm just i'm just starting to think like maybe this is relevant although it's really bad uh yes this share okay here we go so um this is a reddit um which okay it shows my name but i mean it's okay um so this has uh [Music] this is subreddit about bad ui people make bad uis like for this one for example what oh oh okay so you throw something so you set these parameters of physics and then it will shoot something in this canvas and where it's landed is the key it's going to type and it's it's adding the username here it's typing actually ah it's true is typing it i mean you know this kind of thing this is this is really you know it's not really usable like it's maybe showing our next one because i think it's yeah it's not so what is this oh okay so it's just showing random clocks like clocks at random time and the one highlighted is at the actual time i don't know if you did it um why is this i like the one under it is like idea mouse can only move diagonally that's that i like this like this idea like something like that because of the brokenness right yeah two texts i don't know what it is uh [Music] oh wow so it's kind of funny the keyboard what is this magnified okay learn the code okay so you set the passcode but why is it magnify i don't get it okay no alcohol yeah keyboard i think ipa is the the one for the pronunciation or something i don't know is it typing with the sound players i have no idea no keyword wow [Music] okay oh okay so i think this is a classic like you have like slider that is like a really big number and you have to like adjust like really tiny bit to make the same number or something with the with the slider yeah like i think some of the like kind of popular ones are like you have the date from i don't know 1900 until today and this is like mapped to one slider and you have to choose your birthday something like that oh okay so it's it's subreddit about like these like you know stupid examples i mean of course they initially make it um what this capture that you have to defeat yeah so i mean it's you know often it's just stupid i mean yeah this is really stupid uh like you have to choose from like really huge list but it's it's it's interesting you know exactly what we talked about i think i mean not the same way but it seems to me that is but it it comes from a reference point again like yeah because you have the expectation of how things work exactly yeah so but you so you need that reference point um so in our case for instance like we speak like the glitches this kind of thing that's not a reference point that's that's something that the people cannot relate right it's very specific so that's something we want to introduce through what people we have in common exactly yeah and i think would be nice i also like them to take some uh text and put some tips and doesn't necessarily have to be like uh we can try different ways to put the text doesn't have to be you know this uh uh dyslexia website no this is really funny like it's just speaking about uh which with text [Music] so i i don't find it damn uh so basically there's like a attempt to make oh yeah this one share screens next yeah yeah so basically it's saying dyslexia would look like this like if you have this text yeah the text would look like this and that's why you cannot spell anyways yeah what i like is them you can spend hours like with that yeah so like what like we can think about text and from what we do so it's already connected but also like you know can we add one layer that like with just with the text we can do something about glitch yeah like this one yeah yeah yeah yeah what i think is interesting from the from the from the text is always that the text is very concrete now like yeah text will be always concrete so it will bring the person down to something that is very down yeah and yeah so what's the next step um i think we have interesting things and we just need to think how we work i think we will will be interesting if we put just a few sentences like in a in a document and a shared document then we put different text and i will say like it doesn't have to be necessary i mean mix between from things that are related somehow take the text that we have greetings somehow or in relation to what we do so around the same topics but i also could be my cat went to the toilet or i mean could be not related whatsoever um i would suggest that they are though they are these two uh non-related uh sentences there from these two topics from the practice how would you in the practice exactly absolutely exactly yeah yeah and and just completely then you put up sentences of what happened with formula one and all the drama so i am really tired oh yeah because when you went to sleep then like 5 00 am no i was really lonely that's crazy yes wow what time did you wake up then like nine i don't know i wanted to sleep longer but i couldn't anyways yeah yeah yeah well okay i understand in your time yeah uh well you told me but what was the help because i checked i thought that somebody died or something you know no it's just uh it's just a drama like political drama anyway like like you know someone pushed me out and then they talked to the sporting director and then they have to decide who is close to penalty and stuff like it was like all about this for the whole race it's really uh wait so [Music] i will propose that we do the uh a shared sentences like a table document i'll just make it i'm going to share it share the link to you but i'll just do it now yeah that would be nice so that i can work on it later um hybrid and i'll just add that to the page somehow somehow yeah i think it just comes random just yeah just put it somehow like and then we talk in the way how you put it like so put it somehow yeah you can you can decide how you put it and then then we come back and think how you put it but for now then just recollect this you know what like this is exactly the best practice api we exactly how because all this had to become features somehow like even and also you know like practically speaking like we make text and then somehow it's something that the web page can take it that's or not but but no and any way we can reuse it yeah that are all courses they're not implemented they're part of the api right yeah yeah [Music] yeah that's true cool um what else before i go to sleep wait i'm just right uh no so this actually so i guess is this a chat like like this whole thing but well i mean what i'm trying to reflect somehow is that new way new google sheets json text i guess somehow text i call it text json text yes how do i move this oh yeah maybe can we cut the chat here i think anyways we will upload it because it's really kind of started like that so it's not exciting it is very strange um [Music] it's difficult to not speak about like this installation i was trying to not talk about somehow but but it's difficult to speak like i think it's good you know yeah it's just another episode i think that i think the difference in somehow is like when we have the chats before these topics we don't have a clear reference you know like we don't have the goal we don't have exactly like yeah so it becomes more political or more around but it's not that clear where it has to go but now there is really concrete it has to go to an installation an interface other people have to interpret somehow uh yeah i guess yeah um all right okay yeah let's cut here and then just yes thanks for watching and i'm gonna check out my tutorials too yeah by the way i checked your for like yesterday i checked for the first time your first the whipped the from the web the latest one i uploaded like uh like now uh is uh i made a to-do app with hydra what is the number number three or number four it's a number four the latest one like i just did it now like but this thing of the this torus thing is it like you you manipulate i mean i didn't i haven't watched it but uh so this story stick allow you to then you work with html tags from the javascript yeah like basically it converts the html like how you write html as a string in javascript and then it will take it and then generate dom from that as well as you will do appending uh to the dome it's the same with react or other frameworks okay anyway so thank you thank you very much to watch this if you watched this has been such a weird chat yeah it's okay it's a part of the archive yes yes follow up", "Qd5PWe9hrw8": "okay so recording process is on so hi julia welcome to nice to see you and this is now odo nice to meet you nice to meet you where are you where are you at the moment what is that narrow uh entrance area this is why this is my uh constructed office in the between like in a hallway between the living room and the upstairs face what i really what i really like is the pipes there it looks like you're an architect or something i know it looks very fancy no no but it's all papers from the children ah okay this is papers from the children for children yeah it looks like these pipes where you put all your planes all my oh yeah all my paintings no some posters yeah how is how are you in a hotel good here it's seven times p.m 7 p.m for you yes so we have this conflict with nauto because then it's like we are trying to get like to adjust to the the schedule and then is um so then if it's before 11 30 or 11 when it's like time 30 or something it's like super time for naoto so it's it's like right in the moment when you're taking your dinner right yeah i just had my supper and and then if it's like for you if it's afternoon then it's a little bit too late for me usually yeah yeah and how is it in japan it's where uh it's called scuba which is um like one hour to the north from tokyo one hour and a half and i arrived a week ago so i'm still have one week to go with my quarantine and but uh fortunately i i could go out today uh with permission because i broke my finger um when i was in germany and this is not uh recovering i i can bend like up to like here i cannot bend like you know i cannot do like this like make a fist so i i went to the clinic and uh the doctor was trying to like bend it literally like i was screaming oh no that's really hot but basically the doctor was just like you just have to do this and i was like no stop it basically i have to like just keep moving and then hopefully it will recover wow yeah we were supposed i was supposed to go now to japan too for a show oh okay we didn't because um well because they changed the whole current team thing and um it was impossible for the whole team to be two weeks in isolation um because it would take too much time of course of everybody and then there was also a little bit of a hesitation uh if we would get the visa because i think you know like there's a lot of there were a lot of levels so at the end we're like okay you know because i i was super motivated i was like okay i'm gonna do this two weeks in a hotel never see japan like super absurd just maybe have some projections in the back when i do like calls of like japan very kitschy you know to pretend i'm there which i would be physically but not really seeing anything but yeah then the whole team was like nah i don't think we're gonna do this okay because unfortunately yeah first of all i um i don't know if you i i think it was um in tokyo yeah like a performance festival yeah it's happening you know like actually i should check because that sounds really relevant you do you actually have like are connected with what is going on in japan with performing arts or like not even yeah no but next week i i'm going to uh dance studio to dance there's a i mean this place where they do well it's not just contact improvisation but like things around like somatic uh releasing techniques which is not so common in japan i think it's more like you know if you if people talk about dance it's ballet or you know like classical um style in japan but there are very few people who's doing like contemporary like more like releasing and one of the studios is it's not so far from here like maybe 30 minutes oh actually one hour uh i have to go to tokyo and that's their good friends and when i come to japan i try to visit them and they must be connected to those festivals but this is not what this is not related with why i camp right no y cam is more um institutional the friends uh doing contact improvisations but also why campus is more like is more media art or or yeah like it's not uh specifically about dance uh julia i don't know if you know why cam but uh it's uh located in yamaguchi which is like on the other side of the island and on the west and they do media art and performing arts in general not just dance but like theater plays but like always they try to work with um [Music] digital like motion tracking or vr especially like this pandemic time they're investing a lot in like remote collaboration with motion tracking and how to like do creation together while they're um distance and this is outside no what do you mean outside it's it it's not the uh sorry it's not um in the public space it's like in in theaters this festival that you're talking about or it's like i don't know it's an institution more like oh okay okay okay i i found the info so the the the place where we were supposed to show is in tokyo and i think it's going on already since like a week um and it's called dance dance new air tokyo ah okay yeah i kind of know the people i mean like briefly met some time ago yeah um they do it like a bi annually or like or maybe like a yeah exactly it's two every two years that's a little bit the thing and uh that's also why we really try to go because next year it's not going to happen and um but i see it's it's ending today okay started already in october yeah but yeah anyways and what were you going to work with there in japan um i i have a project with a a japanese uh choreographer who lives in amsterdam already since quite some uh like we worked together already since three and a half years and uh we did this project um that was really about kind of unlearning dance or the conformity of dance to approach differently other physicalities and to understand like a different way of connecting or relating um and then this practice that was in in the beginning really more like a practice and an idea of um yeah understanding how to relate to each other became a workshop and then from the workshop it became more like a piece about during corona i think there was uh there was a switch a little bit where we wanted to continue with the idea of of workshop because for us there was like an interest in blurring the the the boundaries between the observer and the observed or like you know like how active you are within this piece as a as a as an audience and to be able to decide also a little bit yourself um but then with corona of course that wasn't possible anymore because you cannot touch each other so then we we transformed it in a way to to a piece piece like a more classical idea of stage piece um but interesting to understand how not to how to take this i mean i told you i think like how to take this intimacy and and and kind of like a very raw material instead of transforming it into something that is made for the stage to kind of like occupy the stage with that intimate material so can you can you expand this a little bit more yeah because maybe maybe you share this with me but it will be interesting too yeah so i think that because it was uh supposed to be or because we started it as a more as a practice um there's of course a lot of um trust and and and kind of like a relationship built up between us as performers or or facilitators of of this of this movement i mean um because can you can you uh describe shortly what is the setup yeah so it started as a uh so dji is the choreographer so who would like initiated project then there was another performer from amsterdam uh andrea um and then a performer from munich lucy who uh is in a wheelchair so they were they said it was first these three people and how they dance with each other and it was a little bit also how you learn from each other and then we had to adapt spaces or think about a lot of ways how we can be together so everybody's needs are kind of met you know so lucy has a condition um where she um she cannot move our her body didn't grow at a certain point anymore but she can feel everything so she's in a lot of pain so for example the space had to be all mattresses and so we try we started to think about landscapes what landscape of the body how does that extend to the landscape of like a space and then we started to construct this like mattress islands where we could be with each other because then she can go out of the of the chair and be comfortable um and then from that uh also to the we we call it like the principle of giving and receiving so it's always this this this motion of understanding okay i i give something and i and then i i receive something within every exchange um and also a lot of um not centralizing the focus on the most fragile body but understanding that each body has their own fragilities and their own needs and you just kind of try to um equal like look at in a more like a horizontal way um to see okay everybody can be a giver and everybody can be a receiver at a certain point and how does the flexibility of these roles um kind of like influence the relation we create to the other and how we how we you know then uh engage and um and so for example lucy she she was really she really wanted to explore the the physicality of twerking so then together we kind of try to understand how do we have to be the extension of her so she can twerk so we you know like how what is the position she had we have to put her in how we have to help her support and then this became very transparent in a way because then also we always say like can you help me this can you hold my leg here can you do this can you do that um and this for me had or like for us all had a very honest and and transparent quality that was very raw but of course uh often when you think about then the public sharing or going towards a stage you you tend to transform what this apparatus of the theater represents and transforms so you kind of like you know connect or or relate to to that to that level or to that legitimacy of this space and then for us it was really to say okay how can we really share what we have in the studio on an also very um yeah undirected way like just this happening but to really have it so and and where in the beginning maybe that workshop would present a better format for that we then started to make this show where it's a lot uh but everything is kind of visible so it's like okay can you help me do this can you help me do that and of course there's a certain uh trajectory or like a repetition how we how we build the piece um but it goes from the very intimate of like this chit chat thing where they just hey how are you and you know touching the hair and like doing this to like growing extensions then the second the third person comes in the fourth the fifth effect and we become this like kind of octopus of many people helping trying to each other to uh move in certain ways that happens it grows in the during the piece yeah yeah yeah that makes me think a bit on the there is something that we we we mentioned in in the practice that we have with naoto that this idea of like give back agency to the user and then so that's uh sometimes we propose like live streams that have been like i mean with some pauses but likes we went like for i think six hours one day when we were in puff i think and in part that was like the idea of doing something so long also was partly to not thinking that we are doing something good but rather i mean for like to in a way bypass the responsibility of of i'm doing basically of bypassing the equatorial process of selecting materials and saying this is what i'm showing like take pay attention to this and rather just keep some a really long format where the person actually uh has uh the control of what the person wants to see also because then they can go back or fast forward uh with the playhead in in the live stream so the intention was never like to see that somebody's gonna stay for seven hours to watch that right but it's rather to imagine that something more like a noise that stays like when you are like i don't know cleaning your house and then you put something as background and for some reason that something catch your attention and you give really attention that to that but then it's not up to us what is what we're giving but it's actually up to the viewer or the audience to ground what is interesting and to [Music] to ground it basically um based on their own interests and maybe and i was thinking that in relation because you said something in the piece that you were talking but your intention was you use a different words but it represents this idea of like give back [Music] the agencies to the user you were using more the words like how to like you were using uh like the tension between the viewer and like the audience and the and the piece you were talking something in relation to that like to not have like that the thing that you mentioned was at the beginning to not have necessarily a classical piece that at the end i think you have more a classical setup but that you were working towards more something that it was not necessary where you were challenging where where in in my words i will i will use where you're trying to give back agency to the user yeah i think also like yeah i i i like this idea of um i mean the the the choice of watching but in a very conscious way so um of course then it relates differently maybe to an online or like um a video which is interest like funny enough then when we change the work to this stage version the premiere was online because um in the batter festival there was no public and they made this movie and a lot of people thought that this this piece was the only piece that functioned somehow on this format because it had something already integrated in this idea of non-selecting yeah like you said a little bit non-selecting this material because we just do what we do anyways so it's just the practice that that just accumulates at a certain moment but you could think that before and after it just continues because it's this growing mass of of just physicalities that just you know um but yeah there is there is of course um also taking this responsibility as a viewer or as a consumer let's say like what are you really consuming and how or uh not cons well consuming sounds very bad but it is sometimes for me at least in in theater also a lot of this that you like people come and they really want to consume and have this epiphany of something after seeing like ah okay wow now i know this i do that but not really wondering like why you're asking because it's it it like somehow this separation or this this this this um yeah this again this apparatus of the theater uh presents some kind of ultimate truth or something for me like sometimes really like i feel when i speak with people they look at it and this is this is the this is it when there's a piece about some theme and i and i'm like huh it's very it's very interesting how uh very little the the format of the the formulation or the framing of these the subjects that are um elaborated within the stage are questions why is it with dance or why would you know like um as if that would be taken often a little bit for granted and i think that um that was quite uh or is still a big question like what what is this this physicality representing uh or dialoguing with the the this intimacy that we are looking for why why that what does it contribute you know to to to to think about this um a radical intimacy like uh lucy calls it the radical intimacy like how how does the physical approach uh relate to that or would it be um as would it be the same if it would be just talking would it be the same if it would be you know something else another sort of format and i think and i think that that makes it that makes it different that this is kind of inherent within how we approach the stage um and in tokyo just to say in tokyo we when we would go of course lucy wasn't able to come because it's the flight is too much so we created a distant version which is interesting where she would she is only there um virtually so uh like off via zoom and and on on like a foam piece of this mattress and then we move her around and like she she travels with and funny enough is like the people who saw that version also because we already had it they kind of almost like it more than everyone um because there is something quite um radical maybe not but um yeah intense that we that a lot is constructed around this approach of a body and then the body is taking away uh from that space and then like another another physicality like it's virtually it's there by voice and that kind of like underlines again uh the whole first approach why we did it like how do you relate to other i think i think that this are you saying it's interesting that because um [Music] like i mean i think i'm sure the way who i see it is like when you speak about how to say this um i think this these are rituals you know going to the theater research is a ritual right and this this uh radical intimacy that she calls like it makes it resonates to me and it makes sense because are somehow rituals that aren't established right so uh so it's something it's it's something that are really is being established for a while uh and therefore i think i have i think i have two two things to say to that like one is that one thing is very difficult is like to challenge really like the the establishment of the ritual because already you go to a political and sociological anthropological research of how come in a way that is established in certain way right uh until the place that we are now that you just assume that you go to the theater and you see it and you watch a piece that is being established for this is the way how we develop this somehow and that's why also we have new formats and people trying to do things differently nevertheless we a stage right so there's a medium which which delivers the message the theater delivers the message uh in such a setup that's why i think it's i think it's interesting times when we when when there are different things happening like in terms of medium because like if you speak about like hybrid formats or digital formats since there is not such a ritual yet there is everything is there to be speak spoken now so um so i so therefore i think is uh because from my point of view i think it has to be a lot in the about the medium you know when you mention for instance if your piece and your piece is very central the body but when the body is out so one of the main course of the of the piece is i mean is is changes through a medium then it it just changes the piece in a completely uh something different right um and i think it has to be for what i'm saying the thing is interesting is because it's a question about it's a dialogue over the mediums the mediums so as i said before is a theater then it's that then in that case the the message will be transmitted through the place to the to through the piece but nevertheless the theater is the medium right um when you use like uh assume then some call or a video format then the video call is the medium the transmit that message um and i think so maybe to to to run what what i'm saying is i think what is so i think one thing is like to chat i think is to challenge these uh setups classic setups um is something that is very [Music] um i guess it will demand more resources to really do it in certain way because in a way it's like you're basically questioning the history of why why are we humans doing this basically and it's basically we have to understand that we are in 2021 and somehow when you are trying to propose something new within a classical format is basically you're just challenging the past which is it which is which is is incredible and it's very good but that means that consumes a lot of resources and energy because there should be reasons why people did it in the past in such a way from different perspectives um from the place that i feel more keen to it because of course it's the place that i'm working more now it's more in hybrid formats but in a way i think it was in a way how art was at some point that you have like almost like art for art and people are just doing whatever uh in a way without being really conscious of what they do um but i think it's interesting in in uh to research the medium because through the medium is that you try to transmit the message um and then that's why what i think is interesting when you try to when we speak about hybrid formats at the core of the idea of these hybrid formats for what i understand is the idea to challenge not even to challenge because they're not even established but just to how to propose ways of communicating a message that is not rather in one only channel but you use a multi-channel and that's interesting to me i don't know how now to how if you how you feel about this you know that i was thinking about something different um no uh well that's that's i think it's what you said i'm curious but i know that it's also related in that specific piece i think it's uh so dominant that you're working with uh how to say like mixed able bodies basically and that's sometimes you know that enforces to like you said you know one person has to be uh remote and this is like sometimes i i think that's kind of thing i'm interested like how to disrupt what is uh normative through these uh let's say disable or mix it make stable bodies like i myself have let's say neural diversity and that's always like comes into the question like what does it mean to yeah interact with people like why do i have to like behave as a normative person and that's also like the motivation like why we like jorge and i play with the like different medium basically that we don't like sell it to a theater like straight to the theater but it's like we're going to like different directions also we started as a practice and yeah and to be honest i'm like really interested in like how there's a process with uh yeah working with people with different abilities well i think this is interesting maybe we there's something that i see that was crossing already like we can talk about this idea of the normative right that uh because when i when i saw also julia the last time you were saying that somehow if i under if i remember correct you were speaking about no not conformative practices or something like this you're doing something and so can you maybe uh introduce us a bit of this idea for the people who are watching this yeah i think um i mean um you brought up a very uh interesting word that i have used a lot also like now in the in in is this disruption and i think it's very um it's very important uh or interesting and not so much in um in a negative way or like in a aggressive way or something this disruption of you know decentralizing a certain things and yesterday i was talking to um an artist and he was using this word uh or this term gravity pull which i i didn't know i don't know if it's like a general i mean a term but this idea of that um that it's like this we go to something like it pulls towards this and and often let's say it's going to the subject no it's the subject it's in the center and and we have this gravity pulled to something and for him for example he said that dance is like the spectrum that is open so it's it's not um or like the the aim would be to use dance in a in an idea um that it's an open spectrum so it doesn't have this but it's basically kind of going like when you know when it goes through the prisma and then you have like this light um and you relate a bit this idea to uh you have you heard of this and of this idea of the sentence of like the medium as the message um yeah before no i think so yeah but just maybe isn't sure like that because that's something that is very core for us in a way like the exploration not of the content but of the medium itself which was what you're saying is uh it's basically it's just to refer to that idea yeah some person that it says the medium is the message meaning that the medium like is what it will form by itself the content rather than focusing in the content to deliver the message yeah i think i mean there's like a lot of overlaps and i i try to because i can get carried away a lot with a lot of different things but i'm trying to be a little bit concise so i think that um a difficult or like let's say for a more general problematic of our times let's say or something for me at my perspective is that um we try to elaborate on a lot of concept notions and and let's say critiques but they are constructed within the same frameworks what we critiquing so because we are staying in the same patterns and in the same way of of relating um we cannot really um break these these um repetitive motions so if we talk about i don't know queerness or imperialism all these kind of different things at the end they kind of come together to the same frames because we we use the language we are we are conditioned in that way so what i think is interesting in the idea of disruption or then the multitude like what is the multitude of the one or like what is the parallelity of certain things um is there a possibility going through these practices or are different non-conformative practices that i say that are um very much uh constructed or or um built through another logic that is not the normative one would that give the possibility to really kind of more move within a spheric idea instead of like a directional one because this is also what we discussed yesterday about the dance so it's more like what if you take out this idea of progress that is like this very neoliberal idea like we progress we go like this direction what if that is also taking out of the idea of movement like of course it has to have a direction but if we think about this differently and if there is this kind of like glitching and and and of um like different layering of patterns is there a possibility that it becomes this more a spheric um idea than this directional one so it's a little yeah i don't know if i explain it right but for me i guess the the non-conformative uh practices are for me the ones that that that search or that that that's um kind of like sit within the discomfort of stuff of things and that means also the really the things we don't know and to try not to transform them into our own language but kind of like go with the non-known you know and there for me is this this practice that stays a practice and then we it's like um not representative to anything it's just itself and that becomes a little bit yeah for me a more interesting way of thinking about how also to engage with uh art or or these things because yeah this this the switch of going to the representative is i think it's a very uh difficult i mean i i would like to get away from that i guess um what i think this uh like i i i transverse this this um this idea uh we are relating to something that we work with is around we said that there is so we we use the meta for the the the analogy of metaphor of a sandbox to speak about the practice and sandbox as when kids play in the sandbox with a sand right which is also a term that is used in computer science uh but it's a safe space where you test machines to not allow uh for not when you need to test things and then you you don't want the yeah for in to test things in a safe environment that's sandboxed uh which is similar to it when it's playing safely in the sand right so then we have this uh we say that the practice that the best practice the thing that we initiated or is two years ago like yeah long so for more than one year [Music] we said that place that it became it just it appeared by itself and it is we tried to keep it as a sandbox but nevertheless that we understand that we we want to do more things for different reasons with the practice um one of these things for instance is like then how [Music] you tried let's say how to how you you transfer the practice which is a digital practice in a performance that is a hybrid format uh or how you create this uh from this best practice and installation that is the process that now to myself we are and we're going to make installation in january where is it in now in general which one sorry installation the installation is the in january yeah january yeah in dusseldorf yeah i think so yeah um so and all of these are a bit are different but i think at the core that has this essence of what we think is the best practices and um what i'm trying to say with this is uh that i found interesting and it comes from me as designer um to being able to put in a place that i can actually um how to say that like um so never so i need to find i need to have a sandbox or a safe place where i under when i feel that uh my moral or my things are in line and i can i can i can work but once i have this then i think i can play with that and move it try to push it in a different direction so say if i want if i need to put it in a more commercial place or i need to put it or to be more representative for institutions or for different places then i can do it because i still have my sandbox i think that's at the core what i'm trying to say that only when i have the sandbox i can be able to move it to different places because the sound box will still be the same and that's important for us but therefore relates is how it relates is that basically we're not like trying to make things like efficient or make something pretty that because we can fail in this because we have a safe space we can just try something so it's not like always like we're trying to go forward whatever that means but like today like we were just gonna try something and then maybe we completely fail but it's okay because we keep this format as not as a performance but as a practice and if it's it fails we just try something else next time so i i think that that's how i see the connection with what the uae was saying and then what uh hori was trying to say with the sandbox i don't know if it's i think what is what is very interesting is like if we yeah if we if we take this the sandbox or you know um the practice and then what is happening outside of this box let's say um how that becomes not so much like an extraction for ev for me like lit in in an idea it's like not so much an extraction of something that that you know okay we're gonna do this there and we're gonna do this there but it's more like what if it's just a version that anyway is already implied within this and it's just a different version you know like so um we were i worked with a performer once on this on this uh the the multiple versions of the self and then we had this discussion of like is there a zero person like that you know they take the fixed point and then from there there's the different versions but because we always somehow need this one you know the repair like a how do you say um a real a point to relate to like the ground zero which we fan out or something and um and i don't think so i don't think that there's one like you always multiple you know only out of this and and sometimes you can highlight one more than the other like you know like sometimes i'm more mother than i'm um artists or whatever but they're all they're all authentic so that in in the practice i think what is interesting is to say okay what if from that um practice that is is there and that it's just going and then there's the sandbox how does this can become um versions of its of itself that are already implied within what it is it just it just more like highlights it a little bit more where where but it's not a transformation so this is i don't know if that's something that that is interesting for you because of course there's also the idea that you could transform it to something but i i like this idea that you can occupy in a way formats like the theater the the museum by and and and really reallocating that idea of making something for it or like an object or a design um that that again has this motion of like going to one point but just you know using all these frames and this but then just approaching it through like a different version of something that is already multiple so i don't know i mean if that makes sense but um for me that has like a different way of approaching and then maybe we go back to this like codes of the theater if we can kind of like use what is already there um not so much of contesting it or like trying to transform it differently which is kind of like occupying a sense uh given formats but then approaching them from a very different perspective um could then these practices take place also in in their authenticity instead of transforming towards you know that frame yeah i see i mean that's probably like we're gonna challenge like as as we uh we haven't started uh we still like brainstorming what will be uh the installation for this exhibition in january and uh i think that's like we will come back to this question again and again because we're not probably like i don't know what jorge thinks but i think what we're like in line that it's not that we try to show something as an installation i mean it will be an installation but it's also installation something messy selection installation this is para also this is very funny like people in the impulse doesn't have a lot of problem with this name of the best practicing contemporans they really have problems with that they came to us like how come you know people really have this like problem like in other in other uh in other uh frameworks like in more visual arts people will be or curious or something but they won't open their eyes i remember in vienna people were opening the eyes like yeah like tell me why is the best practice you know like that's very funny always to like um yeah i think i i i'm i'm interested not only now but i have this framework that i think i shared like maybe with the two of you like since maybe five years ago that was called designing art that is i think i show it to you so briefly and the idea of designing art is something that it was when i started working with technology and crosston with design and it's something that i think i will we will apply in in the installation this idea of the idea behind designing or in short is like how to apply design methodologies in our products or our productions and in order to make them uh yeah so i i the framework that we have now to create an installation what i think is interesting is because uh i think it challenges the idea of the audience user uh that you have uh you have an audience when you go to this theater apparatus and when you work with computers then you have these clients that i mean literally programming programming's client which is an user uh somebody who uses the interface right um so although the two are quite different because then the nature of both uh interfaces because the theater also is an interface are different um then i think i think or what we are slowly talking and i think that we are trying to do in somehow is uh creating working towards an installation that is either that is it works for both for an audience and for the user which is something very big at this moment wow but i i like i liked i also i was mentioning designing art because it's something that i have been working the last five years like working in design that is client based when you work to piece a client when you have a clear objective and you have a target group and you know what you're doing in your because there's some somewhat an economical uh clear target in your doing in designing and solving a problem that's at the core designing what in art you have more this framework they are more speculative and they're more questioning things um the client is yourself so it's the frameworks by nature are quite distant from each other nevertheless i always have found interesting how can you how can you try to make them work and i'm mentioning this because i think i i i failed trying to in the last the last time when i was speaking i was uh when i was here speaking i was just trying to say that i found interesting to put myself let's say in a in a commercial aspect let's say to create a piece and go and say this is a product i have no problem to speak from the capitalistic point of view of my peace as a product and in my experience like doing these things for the five years that always it generates like some kind of like conflict within my framework people will start thinking that i'm a sellout or why do you speak about efficiency these kind of things in art frameworks you know like it will be always related to capitalism approach and criticism in that sense i found it interesting for me because it challenged me like the the two side of the brains how can i make something to work that is actually not meant to be in this way and i was related in what you were saying before like how can you challenge these things that already been established and how you can disrupt them just like what i see as like designing or like how you said about making something efficient it's not too okay so it's not that we make best installation like not like to make it productive but to facilitate let's say how audience user interacts with it and like you know because we need this kind of iteration with the people with the users with the audience as artists and this process is pretty much the designing design process so that's where we want to facilitate and once we have it like we can do more practice research in order to make the installation but it's not that we try to make something that you know have people spend longer time with the installation or like have something more instagrammable but like to let's say more like using the design approach in the research part which is not necessarily true but i i see it that way just to make it uh no no i i i totally understand though i um i also think like i mean i like this idea of anyways in general also to you know apply and this for me goes a little bit in the same direction applying uh methodologies or like methods to to to things that you know normally we would say ah you cannot do like who who cares you know who says like uh art is extremely capitalistic it's just so nobody dares to talk about it and that's why i think it's very funny this like best practice because nobody dares to say and it's not because we live by a value system that what who decided that you know it's just like a super uh western central uh value system that was put in place but if you challenge that by saying well we are doing the best practice it doesn't mean that it's the best it's just you actually how i read it is more is the best for what it is for itself you know it's the best way for what it can be so and that's also for me the idea with design no like if you're a designer with a client you have to understand what to apply that what your client wants is represented in the best way possible you cannot become a like the the artist of the product because you have to kind of like make the facilitation the best way possible that this thing shines or is or whatever and and there you don't in a way a race or like that's what i thought the other day because we talked about um i talked with a graphic designer about this like strip like there's this switching also where a lot of designers become kind of like also auto er designing so it becomes more like a design researcher you know design artist and then designer graphic designer or something like difficult um or like this that to see this different so i never thought about and then i thought um yeah so so it's also like you maybe in that process where you were with a client or this idea of like you uh design something for the good of something else and you kind of erase also this this this uh value thing no because it has to be the best anyways so it's like it's not up to you to decide uh if it's good or not it just has to be the best so so this is this is something i think is interesting because it again it disrupts a little bit the hierarchy of okay when it's in that theater it's perfect and it's good and then when we go see it we all clap our hands it's fantastic and if it's in the underground or like in the in in in the side of the street nobody cares because you know it doesn't fit into this like idea of institutionalization blah blah um so yeah i think that's why people are like i i guess like in vienna people were like super shocked about like what best cannot be you know nobody nobody gave you the label to be best no no no ana teresa no uh i don't know whim from the guy but nobody gave you the right to tell you're good how dare you how dare you because because you said like because you put in this context of the practices right because then you have this all these practices that you so then if you assume like this like there was always this idea of like the best practice and then it's like yeah like yeah how dare you how dare you like how yeah yeah yeah yeah maybe just ask those people to uh to say that uh our practice is the best and have a quote that quote and on our website you know and that is a scarce like i said this is the best practice somehow like we tried to make them say it i know it would be funny but that would be funny if somebody asked like yeah because on a teresa the kids michael said it was the best practice yeah it's just like you know it would be fine i mean this is also then of course that becomes but that for me is also playing exactly with that you know like okay um because i think it was like last week or something i had a class in the master about i don't know it's also about something due to the bodies and the teacher was talking about um the ranking of universities and how you know that whole thing started and you know you put money and blah blah blah blah um but it's so is so absurd is is so not reality based no why and it's very strange it's like also very strange like uh so because you became the best of course you attracted like people to invest more and because be more investment you could be like have more things but you know and then it becomes a very strange uh construction of what is the best in the way because it it's all like um yeah and and then they yeah how universities bought like exactly this quotes by very important i don't know mathematicians who like okay you give me five thousand dollars and i would just say yeah this is the best university you know it's like it's insane it makes then it makes like it's really it erases everything of value that you can think about because it's just it is arbitrary you know like okay so maybe you should try like i don't know what is what is the highest what is the highest rank in in contemporary i don't know dance or art today it's odd huh it's us because it's the best practice exactly yeah then you know what like uh that reminds me of my uh the text i wrote for myself uh about yeah about myself uh naotokida is one of the most important figures in the field of the best practices and contemporary dance and has been taking a crucial role in the best practice chat since 2020. so that's uh that's about myself and that's not uh false because i mean it's only two of us doing this but it's like funny yeah when i read that i think it was really funny because in one hand so it sounds very funny but at the same time it's real because yeah of course you're only important in this field like for this room so it was yeah i think it's nice this um yeah i had it also the other day when uh i i got invited to a talk and then um it was about uh dramaturgy and dance and uh and somehow yeah i got done also like they would just like yeah so we're going to talk to this and these people who are like the new most like important leading voices of dramaturgy and dance and then i don't remember like a friend of mine was like yeah because there is none i mean there is no dramaturgy and dance doesn't exist as a field so everybody is a leading voice so i was like yeah exactly it's a little bit the same like yeah um yeah um okay so i think i think and i don't know if maybe that was a good time to close now it's one hour we don't want to take more time from you julia so we have the hashtag that's yes you always forget like yes i try to make this a tradition so when we have a guest [Music] to make a hashtag like not to wrap up but where you don't have to wrap up you can like stir it up but just have a hashtag about this chat it would be nice ah okay so i have to think wait and i have to yeah just um [Music] it goes to the database the two people already failed two people failed what does that mean they use something that already exists or something no the first uh joanna was uh she was like like saying a paragraph about the like a summary of the chat but it obviously doesn't fit as a hashtag because and uh annie last time but she said something like she doesn't use a hashtag or something so i i use that as a hashtag i forgot what she how she frame anyways you can you can decide or not to say or i i would say it's like hashtag sandbox as a disruptive practice always like as a disruptive space maybe more voice deep space very nice nice that's very there's there's a lot in that in that hashtag right there's a lot okay we with that we can go that's very nice yes okay thank you uh i will talk to you too i guess different times you you bullder now so i'm julia here i will talk to you afterwards and foreign for the rest of the people like uh thank you for joining and uh to yeah i will bombard you with more stuff now because this is how my brain works like in the aftermath oh yeah well that's good but it's good like don't like that's the way we work also with knowledge like sometimes like first in the last two days i was out because i was a bit sick but then then for instance sometimes in auto have four or half some something in my head we just sometimes send like 15 links non-stop but that's okay we are used to work like this so please do something nice okay so thank you very much thank you and thank you for watching please like the video and subscribe to the channel you", "KG20JkOfWhQ": "uh okay can you hear me yes sounds a little different but yes but the sound quality sounds a little bit different because i'm using the headphones that i just buy oh i'm trying them okay wait i'm destroying what is my video you okay yeah i am just arriving age cool but which headphones is it and it's big yeah no wait this is super strange wait what is my this is my microphone and now okay now i can hear it better okay the sound quality is not so good but is it the one that i have or is it something different most qc same thing because these are this is our nqr the qr 35 the wii u the one they have uh the bottom in the left side those are the 35 i have both like the one on the left is something i can customize from the mobile yeah yeah like a big a big button yeah and this one is like the play and you know yeah uh volume yeah that's the same yeah the same thing yeah yeah the same thing yeah that's that's a good uh good purchase i think i i think i paid like 200 something guy because i was searching i mean i wanted to buy this for a while because i have headphones i mean normally i will not carry this because i have it's too big for me so i have my noise cancelling small ones the sony and i liked them yeah already i lost them one time for me they're okay so i just bought them again um but of course the noise cancelling is limited because it's it's an earbud it's not you don't have the sound around so then i try this one on it's way different yeah yeah i mean it's with a video call it's a bit tricky you know you they have this uh settings for like hands-free or something where um no i don't want to go into it because it's very tricky like uh basically it has microphone that you can use for the video call and i don't know if it's the one that you are using now but as soon as you start using the microphone on the headphones then it changes to the hands-free mode and the sound basically it doesn't do noise cancelling and it does the opposite because when you have noise cancelling and you talk then you hear it very differently because you don't hear your voice so they try to have it simulated with the with the pass through but it's i don't know i don't really like it it sounds like really noisy yeah but you're the but your voice it doesn't sound like like yeah i hear myself in noise cancelling i see there is some noise coming there it's because i mean noise cancelling right it's not it's coming through or not it's blocked or it's coming through yeah yeah so when you speak with me you hear like are you in noise cancelling right now i am using the microphone of the computer so i i'm [Music] not it's my it's noise canceling it's like blocked you know you're talking i'm talking with the ears the microphone closed yeah let me try it like for my speakers no my microphone system um let me try it out okay so now this is not my microphone not your microphone what do you mean which microphone wow yeah it sounds like now different yeah now i hear you like normal yeah now i'm using the microphone from my computer and the noise cancelling the feedback yeah it works as you said yeah it works like this yeah i mean yeah you get it so sometimes you know different depends really like sometimes pass-through is easier to talk sometimes not so um yeah there's a huge difference there's a huge difference there yeah and the setting setting is so tricky because as soon as you use the microphone of this then you don't have choice but if you use other microphone then you can choose if you want pass through or not add true yeah yeah yeah that's that's the like if you get it it's like but still like i'm sometimes confused because uh you know like zoom automatically connects to the microphone of this then you know like things get really weird [Music] backstage and then we have to hashtag both also we have to add it but but let let's finish this then in the next so i got my my bose uh cancelling like quite comfortable 35 two uh which are the one who come with the button i was checking fast in the shop the only difference between the 25 and the 35 knowing i'm between the 35 one and two is that you have this button that is customizable here but the quality and everything is just the same um but if so i saw them and this one were 100 euros and the other i mean the average price for like the other ones who were like these are a bit scratch you know like you know are a bit old you know inside also there are not new new new but inside i mean this for what i needed it just worked and also because i have a all previous bose that i lost of course then then i have new new paths that i need to find but i have this thing new uh for the rest was working and the price reduced significantly uh from the other ones were an average 160 the and they were really you know looking like new but this one were 100 so what i checked in belgium shop i check like in the place that i buy things when i want to buy and have support like the place where i bought my portable screen i bought it in a belgium shop that is way more expensive that i know i can complain to somebody close by and so in that shop these uh headphones now are 360 60 euros so it's really expensive um so getting 400 bucks and the work so i just need to test the battery to make sure because they said it's 20 hours so for me if i can make him run for 12 hours consecutive i'll be happy yeah i'm using it for like more than a year and still works i mean i don't charge it so often i mean also i don't use it all the time but 12 hours probably to last when i check okay let's finish here thank you thank you for it thank you both of you guys it's important to contact them exactly but this is not uh you know how to say it it is unbiased video it's not sponsored it's true yeah it's just yeah he's a good product yeah yeah but you can sponsor okay so please thank you for watching", "Dcx-9qNX9dM": "this computer [Music] and we start the chat hello hello danny hello hey hey hey and nice to meet you to see you nice yes yeah i mean like actually it's funny like last days like i was thinking like i i felt like i met annie before but i we never met in real life i think i know noah no oh what do you what do you live in holland annie no no i live in france but i'm going to move back to holland uh in next september yeah i saw something in facebook like are you originally from holland yes and i lived more than 35 years in france i think for now so it's kind of strange to go back but it's also very nice it's like a new project again yeah imagine yeah you don't both don't live in your own country either in your mother in here and you don't speak your mother tongue either no very no like we have this conversation with a um with some person we are doing some festival of performing arts and science in belgium and i'm doing part of the creatorial team and we were talking with this person which is uh it should be 75 or something like this and then we were talking about the i was sharing with him that i think one of the reasons that i feel comfortable with nauto that all things that just happened naturally was because i don't have like the my conceptual speaking or my work was developed in europe so when i try to speak about what i'm doing in spanish it's very difficult to do it and when i met now ottawa we were sharing these things and so i felt he understood these things yeah yeah same same for me and i have been thinking a lot about language and at a certain point in my life i i i said now i'm going to talk the way i want to talk i don't bother anymore about rules or anything and that was for the first time when i could start really working and feeling confident and i didn't think i didn't want to think about think about mother tongue anymore but i've been six weeks in holland and i noticed life is so much easier in your mother tongue i was thinking that right actually i'm going to japan next uh next month like in a couple of weeks actually and uh really looking forward like last time i was there was two years ago already so yeah i mean i can't really imagine how it's gonna be like i mean i need to quarantine for the first two weeks or so at my parents place um but yeah i'm really looking forward and maybe i don't know how people will receive what i'm doing but i guess i shouldn't really care because that's like the problem in japan that you know you have to be like in line with everyone else right you cannot do something completely like different like how we do what we do with best practices it's like something japanese people wouldn't do but yeah i think somebody i mean one extra so i was with this guy we went to see this performance in nemo by the way i didn't know about this place nemo in amsterdam it's like a place for art and science as a museum also and they have a studio so in belgium we have a place that is called imal that is what i will call a similar nemo but we don't have them this sinking titanic this is a huge museum they have it's a very big space they have in belgium we don't have that we have the studio part and some museum and i don't know why i was telling that what was i talking about best practices for what yeah yeah yeah so then the way back then we were trying i was trying to say i was trying to explain somehow within really already because i'm getting i can i guess more comfortable speaking about what we do so already depending who is talking then i will in short try to tell what we do nevertheless it's very difficult to imagine right so yeah yeah it's because because because it's between you it's something you do yourself i try to watch several times you don't really see it or not always like it's it's i can get a feeling somehow by imagining how things are going yeah like what's working yeah okay the practice yeah your practice it's uh it is a practice it really is it needs the body it is it is is in uh in the state of its uh constant state of becoming i will often use that word and or is something is or is the promise of something yet to come every time we practice so it's something that is in the air somehow like what you see like the archiving is an archive of what happened but it's not the practice the practice is as as you said i think i agree with you i think the practice happens when we practice because basically we have to deal with the bodies and the space that we have and that's no different from the performance size of it because we are already sometimes working on the performance uh now we tried in in in the impulse on the first time in vienna and then we did two times in france in the performing arts forum in puff and i think it's the same in both aspects like although we have done more than 40 practices digitally through video calls and we have done only three performances in the space i think something that is clear to me is that the practice is as you said a practice and is only in that aspect is similar how dance is that it's an embodied experience um and i speak only from the point of view of me as a choreographer and as a dancer and i cannot speculate that much about the audience and that's something that it comes very often because as you said is as we're speaking we start this thread of communication now the what are we doing is very complicated uh somehow to grasp or to have a sense of it so i will agree with you anyone you said like but that is somehow is it's a framework now to myself develop and i think it makes very much sense for us but i can imagine and maybe make nothing more sense for different people because it's just me and now to having fun i mean that's where like we started yeah it's a research and then like now i think as a kind of next phase or like another branch that what we say is to make a workshop out of this like how can we involve others while we protect like kind of protect what we do in a way and this is something we have been discussing we haven't done but i i thought maybe that's something we can talk about but what it can be we propose this to like some of the things that is clear to me also is that this means time basically and times means like yeah this means time and so to take the time to be more let's say conscious and then working towards different aspects one of the aspects of the workshop for instance it means that we have to get clear economical remuneration of what we do otherwise then so because then it becomes when we start speaking about labor basically um because the practice as i speak is just so fun to do you know then of course like even if nobody's paying us like how many times we have i think we have more than how many hours we have a content of internet right now 150 or more like 150 hours of function crazy crazy by the way we don't get the i i'm not eligible for like youtube you know like monetization so i don't get any money from youtube just just yeah but the thing is once you get like 1 000 subscribers from that point i think you start getting some and 4 000 watch hours which is actually more difficult yes okay yes so yeah i mean we were speaking about like the money side of it like i was bringing because as i said the practice is just such a joyful place for now to myself to be to liberate different sort of energies and stuff uh i speak from my own experience with this is the way i found dance back again because i stopped dancing i'm a professional dancer and i stopped dancing five years ago with my own traumas i think with the stage and stuff um and then on the way i was not searching but on the way i met naoto and then i started dancing again so and i'm super happy with it so so this is just such a pleasure for us to do um so then when we speak about the workshop for instance like because for me this is when we when we need to start like then we we spoke at some point about uh responsibility or i use those words in that in in the sense of like sharing or speaking clearly about something or grounding the the practice and the star like searching for visibility or communicate ideas in order that other people can get benefit from what we do uh that requires somewhat labor in my head idea of labor that i'm still i'm working on this and and deconstructing this idea through daniela's uh for instance daniela bersham uh it's a person that we met in puff um and she has a practice that is about somehow now is really the core is labor and how you can deconstruct labor in a way that you can actually can uh she's very advanced in this topic that i don't completely get it but this idea of labor and an understanding that is just life and how to take care about how to care about others and make it possible for others without the need to feel there is something that you have to do and it's a burden but that could be so simple as do i have to brush my teeth for instance do i have to cook for myself those things that like sometimes we are working and i'm like ah i don't want to cook but i need to eat so yeah this kind of aspect is something that uh uh yeah when we speak about the workshop for instance yeah this is something like i wanted to ask honey because she's doing a lot of like performances but also workshops i think they are like all online right my workshops not only i've done last i've done a whole week in in lyon at a certain point but it was about online work but we did it in space together so i'm not only online but most of it is indeed online and i think i i couple that to what jorge was saying somehow because what i i think is if you talk about earning money and labor that's two different things already for me and um as soon as you want to earn money institutions comes in and then everything becomes political in at a certain point so um why do i say that i think it's important to realize these kind of things you you cannot keep your joy completely as soon as you want to be paid for it i think that's almost impossible because being paid is being paid by someone yeah so you you are aware of it probably yeah these kind of things i think then it's like for us it's like kind of trade-off that do we want joy like that's like what we do as a practice so that's kind of reward even though we are not paid like we have a joy so we keep doing and then if workshop i don't know maybe that brings us joy like some sort of but then if this labor thing beats the you know the level of joy then probably we want some kind of remuneration and then that's yeah that then go back to what you said about the institution and then we have we have to kind of take one of one of those like money or joy but with the way uh the way i do my workshops until now is they are always very very very joyful and it i take a lot from it especially the online ones because the online ones are constructed around an idea of trust and attention and paying attention to the people never too big groups and it always works i'm always astonished but it works as soon as you can build a situation where people trust you that they are important and that not they cannot do anything wrong in what what you are doing then it works then they start listening flowing uh work doing things and if you re react to that and i think i see that in what you two are doing all the time also it's not you are not directing anything you are you are just doing things and having all what you have open to capture what's happening and to work with that that's what i what i what i see in in what you do and i try to create the same thing in workshops okay i thought for you it's maybe more difficult because you unless you work with people who code but this is not i mean i think something that it was clear to us like we started speaking about this in the impulse ends that actually at some point we thought yes you know like let's say that if you want some but it was this question like do we do we need some kind of like procedurals uh until people are able somehow to literally some kind of like glitch images or something like that um so then we have to go through some procedures of like working with the computer in certain way that anyway can be minimized until the minimum point and we can work our encoding forwards to create frameworks that allow this for people but i think we talk in the influence among many things then is that i think it's more interesting actually to use is not because that's the technical side of it that's what we do the it's just the technical side but i think what is interesting is not that for us but it's just actually what we're doing so it's more the idea behind how to use the medium basically this is more the idea behind the tools so it's about exploring the mediums the medium the mediums that we have um so then that we can start speaking enough in abstraction in an abstract way in different yeah to basically define how to create a workshop uh that not necessary needs to have to deal with the same tools in the same order how we do of course then still we can use computers but people maybe they can use we can suggest some things but we don't have to spend three hours in setting up systems so for example like i don't know what's a good example but uh not using code but maybe we can use some kind of predefined tools or even like go for something like adjusted movements we can do a lot i mean any you do like a lot with words like movements um maybe that's kind of the avenue or we can remix the videos what we produced or people can like record something on and then use that as a material and then just creates kind of feedback in a way so these kinds of things we are talking about so without like how do we do it without code for the workshop ideas yeah yeah but when i hear you talking i hear that you are the uh the center of it is that necessary i i think people need to feel that they are the center if you in workshops like something that like something that i think i will that will be nice is like i'm i'm speaking this for my experience with puff i don't know if you know this place that it was funded by this guy called jean ritz i've never been there but i know lots of people who've been there yeah so jan rizzimon passed away last week by the way yeah um and uh so that's i think that's a place that it uh it's is i would like to say the way how how you understand your relation with buffy takes some days because it's the first three days they are very confusing because they're not guidelines and it's a huge house like with capacity for more than 100 people so when there is no guidelines there is a self-checking there is no symbols and there is nothing designed so basically you have to find your way through exchanging with other people um uh and then use your common sense in terms of how you think you can do things um so i'm saying this because ideally i imagine a workshop where somehow like puff alike in the same that people can find their space and feel comfortable in the space uh doing what they want to do within a framework that we propose but does it have to be within the framework we propose yeah but then the framework can be loose as possible i mean that's the whole question i mean that maybe that's the whole question how what is what is the framework like what are the the elements that we're going to use there there's there's some um i also have a project that calls constellations where we are with three generations of women and we do things together we started with three of us and we had six sessions of online working where one of us proposed something and the others would help to discover what the other person proposed then we wanted to make that group bigger because we liked it very very much what we were doing so we asked three other people to join and we did i didn't immediately notice but then there came a problem because those other three considered there was an end to what we were doing while constellations didn't have an end even we called it an archives but not archives what we had because there is no end the same things you were you are saying and until today those three new people somehow didn't catch that they want to get something out of it they want to make an artwork it needs to lead somewhere and it's it's very difficult for them to do something at the end that you call an anarchist that is not an archive it's not an artwork but it has to be done in order to have a kind of trace of what has been happening in the research we were doing how did you find it i'm just telling that to see that's a that might be a big problem was it like through open call or you talked like privately to have the new members no we we asked them because we knew them we were three and we each of us invited one other person that we knew and that we thought might be interested and interesting yeah i think i think i the way who i perceive that in dance that was happening maybe five years ago was like the boom of this what is called like dancing as an expanded feel or like dance 2.0 it was bring somehow through uh um there was not a clear intention in what that was done what dance was doing so certainly there were no dancing and and there were different a lot of different aspects like i can't recall like examples like martin spamber was doing things uh where he just put a lot of different elements in the space and there's not too much happening at some point people will start dancing but you don't really get when and if it's important towards the space that you are part of it uh but what it well i'm mentioning this here because i see it work because the performances were really long so then the people have the time as i was mentioning also with path i think there is this connection that people have the time to deconstruct and understand what is expected from them to do in the space while if it's something that is in a shorter period you might get just confused and you cannot get out of the confusion so let's say if you're in tough for like one hour then you just have the confusing moment and that's it yeah i think so like now it took like it took some days to you know like was it like that to you like the first days i didn't also bother you too much you were answering me when i asked you some things you i felt like you don't need to say this to me like i just you do whatever you need to do and then after like i was fortunate that we went together so you know if i need to ask you something i can ask like trust you and that's like already something and maybe that's like kind of leads to a workshop idea because like i as a workshop participant i don't want to be thrown into that kind of you know chaos or like for like nothing that i have to navigate all the way to find something in like three hours or like even seven days it's just so overwhelming but if there's like for example in my case that puff like i could trust you so that's always like grounding and i know that i will navigate with some interesting things this is interesting because in path like like we we bring and this is in relation to the workshop so there is this idea and poverty has been involved in years into something now is called like accountability so because power is such a big space and you don't know what is going on that something's life happens sometimes and you feel affected somehow so you need to find somebody accountable or for acts that happens towards you or something that is certainly disturbing you in a way that you can just let it pass so we don't talk about the police or anything like that but it's just there is always there are some people who are uh part of the accountability those days and then if something happens that you really need to speak with somebody then you can go and contact them um so i'm thinking that maybe in this idea of workshop i i like somehow this this element of uh not necessarily be in front of the workshop but somehow be accountable or like maybe not that's not the right word for the workshop but just making sure that the people understand that if they get lost that's uh they can ask for help um if they get lost or if they get angry or uh anything that's that's a good technique but when you talk like that i think i'm thinking all of the sudden what what would you like why would you like to share or what would you like to share because that was the starting point you do a workshop because because because yeah because of what i i do my workshop next sunday because i've discovered it's nice moving with other people in front of a stream and it gives a kind of freedom and a kind of experience that's very very special and i have the pretension i can do things to make other people experience also that same joy so i give them something yeah but that's quite constrained and it's it's it's quite clear it's very determined in a certain way and inside this detail determination there is a lot of freedom but the borders are clear by the way and so still uh slots for your workshop yesterday they said there's no place anymore oh i mean i i actually checked the email and i couldn't register because i'm traveling on that day but anyways i will uh put links to that also like you have a performance on [Music] thursday is it yeah thursday but to be honest that's the first time we are going to record before because we couldn't all be online on thursdays so we will be recording on uh on wednesday i see i'll put links anyways in the description for for advertising um i think like i so from my perspective like when i when we think in the workshop like uh i have been in dance then then it's constantly you know i will give a workshop as a dance as a dancer um as a professor a teacher of sharing knowledge of dance in different frameworks since maybe 18 years ago different dance techniques and stuff uh but body relate uh were very very much classical almost where uh yeah what i'm saying and saying this is because um when i think of the idea of the workshop and then i think in what can we share from what we do is that um there is so many gestures there's so many gestures that we have found between what we do with now autumn mean but it's because we have been insisting in the form of formula or one year and a half or more so there are so many codes they are not ciphered but we understand them within auto me so there's so many gestures in relation to specifically the body in relation to the video which is that will be like something interesting like specifically to work in the workshop but there so we do it now it's automatically because this is our practice so to share this to share uh the practice uh the embodied practice of working with technology or that to share the queer conversation between technology and bodies um i think then we have to go into uh dance for a for a while and i was meant i shared this idea with naoto um because his dance at the core is an embodied experience so you cannot basically you can read about dance but this is dance is just when you're dancing and and it's just something that you see comes and your body when you go back again and again and you have this joy of dancing and even for reason like in contemporary dance in classes in ballet classes a ballet teacher can give a class by being sitting and then just giving the comments because it's a code it's a codified technique but as contemporary dance as a as a class people use just sounds and like those are the the the person needs to move to give the class um so i'm saying this because there is a lot that uh in that respect like we have so many gestures that now to have with him with his computer and his uh his framework i have so many gestures that i have with my computer and then a part of that then we have the exchange that we already we understand now we do together now we go solo now i go to the other room now i got running uh like there's so many gestures that we have built up on the all of those are coming from a physical perspective that if we want to speak then about the workshop that's what i was mentioning now auto then i just feel then is is more delicate than when speaking about technical procedures in technology because that's just this technique and then it's about like then rationally thinking which framework to use how to connect a step one two three uh and coding and different technical practices but then the body practice is something that is uh and yeah it's something that uh we will we will uh like to try that that's something that comes in the conversation often lately with now to to have the framework to share body and knowledge about body somehow between the two of us not meaning that yeah just to share to think about to be in the space and think together but what are we doing what is the body doing in this moment but you you are thinking about doing that online or in space i mean basically like i think in sure what it happens is i said to know after we did the performances the three performances and then we have some feedback from daniela i remember after i told you i thought i said to it and also this is what i'm speaking when i when i sometimes i talk with naoto about choreography then i was mentioning now to this is what i mean this is is all of those are choreographic aspects and i study dance so this is something that i just thought that we should explore the dance side of what we do but for that then normally we need space and to be in the same space you you should talk with daniel because daniel pinero he is really thinking about exactly these things also and when we have our distant movement practice with muriel me and daniel muriel is the choreographer and the dancer originally and she still is and she's doing a thesis and daniel is the one who's always looking for uh what is the space in what we do online what is equivalent or how how does it does it work when i am in space with people what is is happening online that has the same uh strength force power he's thinking about this this kind of thing he always comes back to that and he's never satisfied if he cannot have at a certain point of feeling as if the body is there that's very difficult this is almost impossible so often we don't succeed at all from his point of view yeah by the way like what's really um maybe i talked about this with you individually but the practice what we jorge and i do is like really visual like we always look at the computer look at each other um and what i like you do with uh daniel uh often you close your eyes and move together and of like the how you connected with other people are with sound you like you ask everyone to leave the sound then the microphone open i guess yeah and uh and then but like we come back to this idea of the space like how we can exist together while we're online sort of um i just thought like that's interesting to me like because it's like completely like what we do is like different extreme in a way like super visual and like no vision but we come back to the same question in a way i think yeah i was just wondering now did you ever organize things in a way that you could interfere in the computer of the other control the others yeah the computer of the other one so that you can control also what the other is coding in the physical way around that i mean we did nothing in internet like with remote control i think it's called but like in the physical space like i remember when was the first time i remember like the first performance we have a note in frankfurt um uh yeah i think what my experience was like nauto was really difficult to really let me do something with it with uh with something because either also i he has more knowledge of what he's doing that i do so uh but in the impulse dance we tried that you remember that when we did the general rehearsal with no internet remember that was that we have no internet and we have this general rehearsal and then at the end we were just using my computer because the other computer was blowing so it was impossible and then basically we were just the two of us in one computer and that day was really was also very nice because before people were asking us like what do you guys need and they were really freaking out because there is this like really impulse that is about dance so they don't really have the experience to how to deal with these things and then we go there and the people are asking us what do you guys need and often like what do you guys need and we talk with now all too like what do we really do we need and i answer to them like we need internet and and then we go we go and check the internet for two days before and the internet was not working yes and then we said like we managed somehow to do the performance without the internet so then them at that moment for me was really open opening because then i thought like we don't need anything and then when i i answered to them like what do you guys need because we are going to work about dance and technology so they need to know that i don't know what they imagine that we need and i say to them like just relax we don't need anything and that's part of the performance we embodied uncertainty and we share with you guys we don't know but that's but that's okay and then we just share it with you in a in a soft space um and that's what we did but so this is to say that the that we were using the others computers and now i when we are in the same space we don't have problems to be in the other computer no in path was easy also sometimes yeah but but i'm don't i'm not sure if it's interesting but you could use teamviewer that's an application where you can share computers so if you have installed that i i'm just imagining you one in brussels and the other in where are you now though in colonia and you are working and on your own computer but at the same time you're interfering in what the other is doing on the on his computer and all that because you always control everything through the vision that's in fact that's your medium that's your your contact line no would you say that that the medium what did you say annie can you repeat that your contact line line when you do your practice and performances the contact line is the visual yes the video like that's what i like in the research we said i said it in my words there is a a new onto epistemological understanding of the body in relation to the video so is the video is the medium yes the visual is the the video is the medium is through the video that we communicate yeah yeah and yeah and you talk every now and then so but that's only use in a pragmatic way as far as i saw i think so yeah i try to understand and the contact line is free is a visual between you and then if you start mixing that up if you don't control your own square anymore then you get a hybrid what do you mean but anyway i'm trying to imagine like that's what you were talking about but that's that can be like something we can try at one moment just to experiment how it's gonna work because i will open like live lab which is like the video call what we use in or his computer to see myself and then i start coding on jorge's computer to change images of jorge and i and also i that jorge is controlling my computer to change images i don't know like it it feels like i often try to not like add more layers but this is this can be something to you know just to play with and maybe we find something that i cannot imagine they think that i like i like confusion yeah and i also noticed that all the time uh i cannot stand things that stay the same so that also means that as an artist i've touched to on a lot of things somehow but um and that's also difficult about workshops and institutions they also try to put you in a certain they give you a sign on you they stamp you and then you have to be like that and it's also always about escaping and after how long do you work together one year four and a half oh yeah already yeah some confusion might be nice too i don't know but i'm confused like i mean if we speak about confusion i don't understand what now it's doing like like i mean we are something with something that was like uh and and feedback from daniella when she saw the pieces and these things i think is more clear when like in the same space that's why for instance i'm not completely sure i mean sure like will be interesting to try the remote control but practically speaking i think just for a side of the technology i think it's just adds too much delay in different terms that we might we might try uh but what i think is it happened because already it happens in the space uh i think will be more interesting for instance like the last performance we did now also you run at some point away from the space that i was and i was pissed off at you like why you're leaving me here but i have some computer there also so then if i then for instance that's some this is something that we can explore more in the space i think uh the presidentiality of of you know what it means if you have three computers when you use which computer uh yeah but this is the performance size of it and i was speaking about like confusion because i think very much what happens in a practice is that we're dealing so that was that's what we said it's a it's a communication between technology and bodies because we use so many different things that is so confusing very fast from the beginning like and still after one year and a half like i don't understand how things are happening very often so and you can hear also when we like in the practice you will hear like me you know also sometimes i use i curse in spanish and then author will say like don't say that like this is very often what happens in the space i don't say that anymore please it's something something i noticed also i never people from dance usually they need to prepare their body and they want to be with their body can be conscience of their body etc etc i never see you doing that so how do you trigger your own movements or where does it come from how you move what is that part of you you you play with code you play with technology how do you play with your body is that you want to go first now oh is that also a question to me no i think uh yeah the answer would be like it's we do it at least like one hour so we kind of warm up for me like first 30 minutes is like warm up like sometimes i'm just like you know doing some repetitive movements and just to get into the mood of moving basically and while coding and that kind of something that i kind of developed through the practices that now i feel like yeah i can do a little bit of coding and then i feel stiff and then i start moving and then i'm like kind of getting bored so i change the cold and that's like kind of the i would say like a juicy moment like not just like we always have this climax at the end but at the same time this warm-up is also very nice like something that i really enjoy yeah i think i subscribe very much like but this is the kind of thing that i said first this is things that already are kind of like we do this in this way like the beginning i feel also i'm warming up like then i'm just in between yeah coding and then i move a beat then i will start from time to time put a song for whatever reason maybe i have a reason maybe i don't have a reason um then i will let my body go then i will let then my body takes me to a different supersona within me and i do that consciously so i try to do an exercise of self-dissociation what i'm trying as much as possible to avoid this main thing that is me right now so jorge and i try to get to other states that i will do also in dance uh will i try to through catharsis get to different things and these different personalities all of them they have different ways to express and i will try to do that in a practice [Music] this is like to me it's really like connected to the earlier like question about like what do we want to like what's the message from the workshop that we want to you know deliver and that's like from from my perspective i i agree with what jorge said but like for me what's more important is like how can we change the way how let's say dancers and like programmers work together because i've seen like so many times that dancers let's say like they warm up because they need to if they need to move with projection whatever that the programmers want to test and then often programmers say that okay i need 10 more minutes to fix it and then this just like you know creates so much tension because it's actually not 10 minutes but they need like actually one hour and the dancers are so pissed off because they're like ready to move and then they have to wait for one hour and then they'll just call it or a day and then you know it never like it's always difficult for them to have like same rhythm to work together and then what we do in the practice is that we kind of do it at the same time like that's for me like it works really well like code a little bit and move a little bit and that's not a performance not it is a practice but that itself is i feel so rich and that may be something that it doesn't have to be like exactly a coding but something we could introduce to dancers and programmers then then it becomes a performance when you have an audience right do you think about that because for me that's really the difference the audience is there yeah of course like that's what i was making of course maybe i'm just speaking like uh as if you know what we'd like so one of the things that so we have a performer that we were inviting at the impulse dance in vienna to give a talk about uh in the way we were invited to the symposium to speak about the framework so which was about digital uh dance and technology and the only the easiest way so we were thinking without what is the easiest way to talk about this that is so complex is just to show it and then after to talk and that's the way how we so we plan so we show and then after we talk and when we finish actually then what you would realize is like wow wait this was a performance and i remember i said to know how to wait this is a performance because we just have this audience and then from that moment then we thought okay so we have this that we call branches so we have different like the chat is one branch we have different branches from the practice and so one branch then now we're trying to explore is the performance that's why i invite now to do buff and then we were two weeks in the same space and we performed two times so we have so far i think more than 50 times of of digital practices and we have three performances let's say yeah um then i'm interested in in knowing uh because i think it's very different when you're physically in a space and you have audience then when you have online audience absolutely that is yeah so you you agree because as soon as you are in space with the audience your body becomes an element in space and it becomes also visible for the audience so that's also something that makes it completely different how do you have how do you manage that or in this nothing banished yet i feel i mean not not managed but like like performing in front of like real audience is i think another thing like it just triggers so many different things and yeah and maybe you're going over it more no but i think there's a because the experience that we have so far is that now to get more loose somehow um and i get more restrict restrict somehow so i go back to my own traumas and dance on stage and but then somehow then also i use them in my so my motion becomes that i because i'm not denying them and then now to get super free and then you start running and just doing a lot of stuff a lot of the movement let's say um daniella was saying that she thought that you were a dancer you know like the like uh because you were like moving so much like a uh and it happened yeah and the same and the impulses but at the impossible was clear we said like we have the clear decision that i said to now so we agree like you go and then somehow i have more a communicative role uh and then auto went completely loose and dance all over the place and that's it's really very nice what you tell now jorge because i once did a performance with four performers i invited four people two who had a background in uh running theater and the other in dance and two didn't have a background within order to play in front of an audience and the last two were much better than the first two because immediately when they see an audience they become something and they become the dancer the actor they become so self-aware that it's if you if you want something natural it isn't natural anymore yeah that's my experience i was really it was amazing for me to see that yeah so i think it was like like for instance when we saw this and the we showed this above and then daniella was giving some feedback for instance she was mentioning also that that um but i think in our case what it works is because is i think it's honest so said that i don't know uh yeah it becomes it becomes honest in that sense like i think we were doing that performance for three hours was three hours that's three hours and i think in three hours at some point i think at some point i guess i did some movements like uh it was just one time that i did like some i do capoeira for many years so i guess i did something in relation with that like some some sequence that i know from capoeira by heart which are spectacular somehow and i was i did just one movement do i guess during the three hours like really a part of that i guess i did not do too much and then and vanilla was mentioning also that you know like how they have this balance where naoto was very much moving and in there and then at some point uh it happens also this view towards the movement that i'm doing where you can see wow this guy can do these things and but at the same time it just disappears in the space like nothing happened so there are different elements that were on the spot uh that happened and there was no intention i mean we didn't plan to do these things it just happened because we are in the space um and i think it works very well um because we are not trying to use it also you can also use it i think as lo i think as long as you are i mean that's why i speak for myself i think as long as you are comfortable what you're doing then everything is fine if i decide to run freddie aside to sleep asleep and it should be fine um but then for me that's what i'm speaking about honesty it has to be an honest space right also it's interesting oh sorry that what i found in the last two or maybe all the hybrid performances is that now i can understand that i we need some kind of structure otherwise like i'm challenging myself every time and it's like like i go i'm like released from the cage but at the same time like i really have to like you know constantly challenge myself to do to go crazy you know it's it's in a way it's natural from me but also it's very challenging and it would be nice like as like especially when we have a three hour of performance we need some kind of coming back to choreography we need something so that i can i know that i can do it in three hours and not like challenging myself every moment yeah yeah yeah but what i said about i think it's really interesting to to have two bodies that have a different background and uh that's interesting already for for the the audience that's their life to have this difference so that uh so you shouldn't bother about it no not at all i mean but that's i mean how to say this is like because we are talking here about like when you speak about the performance or being in the space that you speak about choreography like uh and so which is basically how you structure elements in space for certain given time uh not necessary bodies but just how you structure space and time that's what is choreography and then i think what is so far what is tricky also the from what we do is like no matter what we do it works it's because we are not aiming for doing something good and that's something that is clear to me like when we do the performances somehow they work like the third one uh when we when we didn't chapel that was i think too much because of the space was really strong it was a chapel inside of path it was really strong but the one we did with audience with daniela that was i think that was a very balanced uh performance uh and daniella was speaking about it like for more than half an hour non-stop and she's somebody who is very well established she knows what she's doing as uh she's not a choreographer but she works a lot as a peacemaker let's say which is a bit funny of peacemaker sorry it's an inside joke um because of motion i saw peace but no yeah so what i was trying to say is that uh that's the tricky part of this is like no matter what we do then it works uh but and then i'm having this conversation about some phd that they proposed me when i was electronic and some the conversation some feedback that a friend of mine gave me is that until you don't put yourself in the space of to build something let's say like let's say work towards a performance because so far we can work in this way and we just don't prepare because we have the practice and when we understand these gestures then we make it work because there is a natural balance between autism that are different and i'm very different and by luck by hazard we just went we met at some point and it works we balance different things just naturally um so then nevertheless this the perf if we speak about performance or i think the practice itself also until we don't uh let's say if you speak about the performance like commit to do uh performance research so when we explore the choreographic aspects of being in space and then it will state as something different i don't know and that's that's more like an open i guess question or like something that is in my head that i know as a choreographer what we do it works because it's not somehow is not trying to evolve this is what i'm speaking about in simple terms what we're doing somehow is not aiming clearly about evolving something but we just practice and then just we change the space and somehow it work um so we're not trying to evolve this and people would like to have a feedback is like and i understand also as a choreographic piece to make it grow we need to have a normal research in terms of dance research and performance research and i'm like don't you don't you need some something that gives it uh content so that you can deepen what you are doing somehow or put it in a different way is it maybe now about your relation what you are doing and about uh how you can work together is is maybe that the subject you are treating now i don't know but there must be something why it works there is something at work why it works and it's probably your relation i'm not sure but i think yeah no that's somehow i think i shared this idea with now too like when we have this uh residence in path virtual residence where i was in power for two months and now to was in cologne and we i think at that point we break some things and it was we defined some of the structures that we have afterwards that the first thing that we have in the like we said when we're going to work we work together for one day the whole day so we met at some point in the morning then we called that development time then we we basically create a choreography but it was splitted in development time uh there were three aspects now what was on the channel i think yeah development practice practice challenge chat but we we have like little conversation between in between to catch up but the development time was basically what i was mentioning that because the development time was basically it was the moment that we just in the morning say hello so what is the what is in terms of development what is if you think about coding that was just basically the moment that i just connect with now and say hey how are you and this for me meant like that's the safe ground that i have from that but like to i understand that i can trust this person i will share the space this virtual space with him for the whole day and we can talk not necessarily about the practice and i can tell him about how i feel and how i'm suffering and just different aspects and also now also can do the same um just like how well we would meet in real life and just you know have coffee basically so but then i think if we speak about so that's that's uh i'm saying this to to what you're saying annie that for sure like they're the possibility what it makes it possible that somehow things can move and still work is because i trust now to now to trust me there is this trust that is built in time but then when i think in work also i will say that what i want and what i think we have developed that i think is groundbreaking is that we found an embodied work with code that is difficult to share because we break the code and we embody it the code or now like or like technological flesh somehow we found gestures what i will call gestures in how to ignite processes within my body that they go with the computer also and they go back and forth those are many so this is what i said is a cipher it's like it's a code that is full of gestures that somehow we built in time so it works for now to and me and i think that's what is uh groundbreaking but it's difficult to to share the experience with other people like uh because of the embodied aspect of it because there's a lot going on in the body there is not that is yeah that is not spoken somehow [Music] [Laughter] i would love to see you i guess we will do something in in berlin so if you can come to berlin in january we will be showing something probably there in in the headset table i don't think so but you never know you never know in in berlin is that a dance space or is it something else the hudson taste like the whole yeah the university of dance berlin i mean yeah that is that is because that's also something we touched a little bit on uh you can do these things but if you want spaces to invite you or to give you opportunities you have to be clearly defined as because otherwise they have difficulties with it and not maybe the people who invite you but the people who pay for it yeah yeah yeah we have already so that's really one of the biggest difficulties in in in what you are doing probably yeah we you experience that like sometimes people say we like what you do but we don't know where to put it yeah yeah but but you are aware of it and you should be because for instance [Music] i'm i'm much a lot of what i know or what i feel in dance comes from that i went a lot of two things here in montpellier at the time of matilde but now also uh it's uh martina rusam and bojanakunskunst used me to to cut to certain things and at a certain point they wanted me to invite me at geese and at the theater and performance things was clearly impossible because i wasn't really from dance yeah this is funny like i just i saw you yeah somebody who is very active in puff of course and i know bojana a lot from dance from it's part of the dance yeah so and boyana was there when we were performing but you know the weather during the meeting yeah during the meeting but i also we took the decision to like to present the performance when they were doing something else so i mean i did it consciously now to like these things because i know and daniella when daniela daniela said to us invite his people like so it was partly something that i thought it was good at that moment because of the state the performances at the moment i thought it was good in that way yeah um but out of curiosity like how would you describe like i don't know if maybe you're right in your bio but uh what what is your title annie like are you um net argent it changes it's a part of the context i think i stress either this one or that one but but you should know now i didn't do it in the exactly right way probably in the past i've always said i don't mind you call me whatever you want because i i do i touch on everything and i am whatever you need me to be as long as i can do my own thing that's a good way but that means indeed that certain people don't accept you you have to to choose somehow to be part of a certain world and you can be part of two but not a three four five is very difficult because i think like one on one hand it's difficult for us to fit into something i mean for the institution to fit ourselves to something because they're there there's a lot of confusion but on the other hand we can just frame it as this is a hybrid performance and then it's easier for you know festival program or whatever to put it in there or like we do net art and then maybe someone who's doing that art expression can invite us i don't know so that i think it's not necessarily a bad thing um no no but but uh festivals have less money than the dance world if you can enter something like the dance world it's much better that's what i thought that was what i was sharing with now yeah do you see he's like no i know it maybe maybe you should cut the conversation before this okay we're going to go don't put this online we don't go further but this is i think this is like a general fact anyways we don't go further but i don't edit these videos that's that's how we keep up with like uploading our videos so i hope it's okay i hope it's okay if it's a real problem just write to it later anyways um yeah so maybe it's like a good time to wrap up things or we don't have to wrap up maybe like we can like try to make this as a like a ritual to finish with a hashtag because hashtag always talk about this uh like this idea comes back uh once in a while to think about what would how do we summarize this chat as a hashtag or we don't have to it can be something completely different but i i don't have a hashtag maybe if you have one that's a good one i don't have a hashtag give me a hashtag i like that good good good i noticed i like that okay that's great thank you annie for your time was very was a pleasure to have you and uh yeah so much to hear your uh i love talking to you so if ever you want to talk again in the future don't hesitate thank you yes yeah i think it would be more and more in this process i think i think there is so much experience that you have in in i don't think necessarily what we do is exactly what you do but you have a lot of experience and things that somehow we use in different ways so i think there's so much that we could learn from just talking with you and see what you do if ever you have a long residency and i'm not far away i will come and look at you we have a residence okay comment on it that would be nice all right great bye bye bye thank you so much [Music]", "6-KQQtdDLuo": "hello and now you're muted why maybe the computer like it but i'm more i mean if i'm a yellow square the computer might think that i'm okay to talk you can't talk then the computer might like just doubt it like should i let this person this thing talk okay so we are back to normal reality we're back to reality after the dream we're not no longer happy people uh so good morning everyone it's monday right now it's monday yes affordable customer it doesn't mean anything to me but yes it's one day well i just finished the project and finally the circles the one that with the choirs and they were singing with the phone so do they have like a performance already like last night was the performance ah cool was it good i mean there's any recording or any i think so there will be a documentation i don't know how it's gonna be shown like when i have no idea but i can send you videos later but to be honest the most interesting thing for me was that so it was in open space like a square because there are like choir members lining up circles so they had the big space yeah but for some reason they decided to block the view with uh with a fence you know like a construction site fence all around the square or on the square with a like a blank banner so it's like it's like my banner but it's nothing is printed right and it's like all over like only one side is open so that's the side that people can come in but others uh so we had a wall basically and what's so funny is that because you hear the sound from the uh from the outside because like acoustically it's not blocked and they're singing so people are so curious and they come to you know see between the the fences check out what's happening and this was like hilarious like i was just watching people like trying to peek from from outside like that that was a nice performance but what i don't understand is like i does people uh did people need to pay for a ticket to get in no it's free but you have to do it like i mean did this like closing the square did really add something specific to the performance i don't think so i have no idea why it might be good it might be that there are some underage singers so they don't want to be like photographed randomly but once you are in you can photograph so i don't know if they because i didn't check what they say at the entrance so maybe they said no no photography no videos because you know it's i mean as a performance i think it's nice if it's photographed and you know uploaded for publicity but at the same time there are you know kids who are who should not be photographed without constant i mean it's the tricky thing right yeah i mean say for adults which i actually found interesting like for example if you go to that maker faire this kind of event like hacker like big event in uh north america they usually have um like what acknowledgement like uh notice at the entrance that people will be taking photos so you know you can't stop it you know you as you enter you're consent that you will be like in the picture somehow perhaps yeah but for example at uh city like ccc cause communication congress in germany which is like the biggest hacker congress in europe that was the place that you met matthias for the first time right we didn't meet i think we were there but we didn't meet yeah because at some point then i was asking how do you you guys meet and he told me i think that was the first time you guys met i mean or did somehow that he knew about you somehow yeah because i i did a talk which uh happened thanks to john um anyways uh so yeah i presented but the policy is that no photography like photography that if you take a photo you cannot take anyone in like in the frame like you you can take a photo of like how they say like installation or some kind of object but no people in the photo right which i found kind of interesting there's this difference yeah um maybe we want i mean i wanted to talk about so this application things because so we got um so one application that we did that was quite a procedure um was on the fly oh yeah there's a lot of text application uh was very very uh it was very specific um and i also took care of that and he was proposing in that you proposed so in that application we wanted to work with floor basically right so the three of us trying to work in between um a practice uh or all practice and then the practice that you guys have i will call it a practice because i think it's a practice what you have with floor um and the sense of uh sharing knowledge because you guys have experience of these workshops that sometimes you give as part of festivals of things so i i i thought it was a nice uh well-reading application and was anyway a nice process as a first official tried out to get funding to work together with floor um and but so we didn't got it uh olivia jack got it that maybe we can say something afterwards but what i was i was surprised and actually just reflect this that i'm trying to underline is that the application make the process so difficult for other people to apply that less than 20 80 applications applied and i was surprised because i compared that with the process of civil strat that is another application that we did with naoto which was specifically for a price in belgium that is not necessarily related to people who are based in belgium somehow i think they should have some connection with belgium but people from all over the world should they could work and they could apply for for being selected to compete on february 4 22 to get the price so we got noticed last week that we were not selected uh we didn't pass the 20 select selected and i was a bit kind of angry things like but why we didn't select i thought it was a good application and also i think our practice i thought like we should have been selected to compete because just to compete uh for this price but then after i checked the number and it's close to 800 applications and then i thought like oh okay then i mean then then i was like okay i'm i could be okay with it i still want to find out if there are some filters because if i understand well i think there is some filter from which they are selecting some applications also they did not make the cut to be performing in the email they say that they were published uh the applicants um crazy right i i also read it and i was like what like so they basically in a catalog they will list all the applications i mean the title and name i guess yeah that's a lot anyway yeah yeah but no that's what i'm thinking because if i understood also before like announcing the application that's what i'm thinking that i will get that information this is the second time that i apply for this i think joe was to apply with the movie and excitement research i think i guess this year he should have applied as exciting research the last time was like with the moody and in the application for that was very clear that you will not get uh any notification if you are not selected so what i'm my my assumption here is because also it happened in the past that we did not get any information when this passed is that there should have been some cut of people that are going to be selected for being part of the publish publication because otherwise as you mentioned the just the applicants of 800 applications is just a lot for for a booklet but these are my assumptions based on also the experience that i have the last uh the last ride with joe and the notification they clear and bold letters that they say like like don't be surprised like you won't get notified if you're not selected which is like technically it's not that hard they have the list so just like send emails to them but anyways i just want to see like i i will feel more comfortable say this on 800 applications we didn't make the cut of i don't know 50 you know 50 out of like this 800 they sell like 50 and from this 50 they select just 20. and from different reasons then then they can say like okay this 20 also because you have to say specified what are your uh what is your tech writer just kind of things for the space it was quite clear in the application okay um a few things i wanted to say like in the application process not as an applicant but uh like this whole process actually i so in the past like when i applied for some things like big like you know let's say there's thousand applications and then um i got notification that i was not selected but i was in a short list for example like so they exactly you know filter like 100 of them and then they choose and also like really strange notification i got was um i think it was some kind of residency or like some kind of price i don't know but they said they actually wrote to me by post you know like male like physical letter that i was not selected but i was the second one no i was a second one but they only choose one person so you're not selected something like that this was really strange and then i think in this process of applications it differ makes makes a difference like for you as an applicant um that you get some notification like because you're taking the time to to to do that and i'm saying more let's say when there are many uh applicants uh i guess maybe it's different it's just yeah so i think if they have some kind of cuts they should have some kind of cuts from 1000 applications to just 20 right so if they have some filters that will be interesting if they let you know because then that way you understand also how was your performance and also like if you go like even further i had this conversation with lisa lisa para before um that she's because she's she applies for like things but also she is a jury like she's part of like what's called movement research is yeah i think so i think so and she's like around there like she's sometimes like uh part of the jury and basically what she suggests is like you should just ask you know if you're not selected just ask them why why you're not selected and sometimes they actually answer like some comments from the juries um yeah so that maybe we should you know start doing it because i think it's kind of interesting i mean it depends it depends you know for a reason like there are some applications that i don't really care like for instance this thing in norway they haven't get back to us which is super strange because it's happening in november so i'm not really interested in like and then saying like something or asking but in something like city restaurant there is a prize that i'm actually more interested to start applying to these prizes um i want to know something about it i see interesting for me also there was like nice um how to say follow up i think it was from uh baby castles it's also like it's like a residence you know art center around gaming in new york and i applied once for like online remote uh residency and then they wrote to me back that i wasn't selected but there's another round and like there was like basically they had too many applications and even like good ones couldn't make it so just even if it's the same application just try it again because we might we will consider it again so that's a nice comment and i i feel that you know it's always difficult for the juries i mean right like now with all this internet i mean online stuff it's just uh you know sometimes they cannot handle all the applications basically yeah no no i completely agree with you like also because it's i mean the idea and somehow you know the ideas like i i want to become to be more uh performative in these things we also talked about this like you know applications uh i think it was not recorded but like we kind of getting better at this practice and we're like using this as an opportunity to exercise the yeah writing and collaboration uh yeah yeah i think so yeah now there was quite some back in time and now that i think also for instance in relation to dance uh this is like a dance auditions i see it's like an audition as a dancer normally i mean yeah that's not true had like let's say like you know you're supposed or as an actor i guess yours i think as an actor happens more even in hollywood like yeah people have to people have to do auditions and then pass through these auditions no matter if you are brad pitt or you need to you need to do all these auditions i think yeah it's more the case in acting um so then you have this exercise and you have the whole emotion of like it might be selected or not you know will this work or not yeah i see and then if i want to make the coming back to the what you said at first like so on the fly it was like a lot of text that we have to write and i remember mathias was saying so the one i applied for uh matthias you know what matthias organized in austria in alps there was an application for following that uh so that that retreat had an application and i don't know how many people were there like 20 of us like around uh were selected but basically matthias was saying that actually he took inspiration from this baby castles from new york that the application is like really short like there are a few questions but you don't have to write you know 2000 characters you can just write uh in you know one sentence or something and there's even like a question at the end you know like did you like finish this application in one hour or did it take more because the idea is that he didn't want people to take too much time writing the application okay so that not only the ones who can write a lot can get the opportunity but people who usually don't write can also try it and you know get in because that makes more diversity basically and i think it worked well in that in that case okay i i actually i i talked with him about it after i was selected yeah and also the like for example the gender balance of this application was quite like equal i think because i was also curious you know like i was asking matthias did you have to like because in the update the selected ones uh i think they're more or less like 50 50 male and female i don't know about other kind of gender but in this case but uh i asked him you know did you try to balance it but he was like well like it seemed like um they chose the you know the short list for example and it was already kind of had a good balance so they didn't have to really pick you know who's coming from where who's male who's female these things didn't they have didn't have to consider too much which is kind of interesting although they had to say that they have to limit to people from europe because they didn't have budget to fly people in from south america for example although there's one guy who was participating from online yeah yeah it's really telling yeah yeah and i think i'm gonna do something with him because he's doing kind of funny stuff that i really like he's basically during the camp he was making this uh like avatar of everyone but not as a like a body but it's a laptop so it's like olivia like it's not cursor but everyone's so he collected everyone's screenshot of the desktop and basically they put this into this uh 3d model of a laptop and they he made this kind of gathering of laptops as a virtual camp funny some nice projects he's also from colombia i think i don't know where he's based [Music] so well so now we are back in belgium i mean in in our houses this is not yet i'm in the hotel where in stuttgart ah you have to go there at the i thought you didn't have to go all the way there oh and uh yeah this project is in stuttgart and today i still have some time so i'm really chill but i'm going back to cologne okay and then you have whenever you have to go back to belgium oh for the antwerp project yeah uh it's like end of october i think it's like 22 or 23. um but meantime i think we'll have like another like like a less than a week but um like a you know virtual work session and then we'll be there physically finish the project and i'll be flying to japan yes and in japan you will be busy we'll see i think not so much there are only like two things in my mind that i have to do besides i go back to home uh one is the planning for the exhibition next year and another thing is that i'm going to this uh performing arts and media art center somewhere in the countryside the ymca uh what y cam y c that's a good one i didn't think about it actually it looks like ymca that's why i guess i'm not saying like ymca try why can't we like yeah i'm a good center for arts and media anyways and i i hope that we can do something with the with you in motionbank that i still i think so i sent an email to floriano last monday oh he's the dancer yet but there's i mean i don't have a rush now i understand how things the process i mean they just need to answer something and it doesn't matter if you answered now next week but if his next week is not answering i had i guess i have to send him another email yeah because it's less than 9 months already yeah to sign the contract i need to sign the contract and it started fighting for the apartment on this kind of things right yeah a lot of bureaucracy exactly exactly but it's going to be exciting and then we soon have ccl yeah that will be that will be 2021 yeah man there's so much things happening i don't want i don't want to talk too much about many things it seems there are so many things like like almost per day and receiving things like um somebody proposed me some kind of like working in troubling faulty for four years like the last week and when i was on the train going to do this lag geek that also it went uh and used new place in and again that is very specific and this with these light designers from lysip uh that also there is a possibility to work with them and they do different things worldwide uh so much man like so much that i have to think so now i'm at home and it's good um yes and we have to make the business plan we made the business plan already now like the the packages like we have to publish the packages and send some kind of website yeah we have to put that kind of thing and also what i think really because there is no rush in that but i think what's something we really have to do as we can is we need to create some email or something that it uh like a template that we can send to uh the rio and impulse dance for instance uh somebody who else like i they daniel goblin the constant festival um yeah this kind of things like yeah basically about the hybrid performance i think right yeah it's in the it's in the list of the hybrid dock for some time i think yeah we have to do that that that one i think that we have to do that like in the coming weeks um because we have interesting yeah because we have interesting documentation from idocd and also from puff so yeah so you think about it yeah and yeah also because these things so i guess now is the time they will start slowly to start checking who are they going to invite to these festivals and those things are not open calls right right yeah we should make a list of you know important people who to do these things that's also the thing yeah yeah we have no we don't have we only have the list for invitation for the chat you have to we have to do this again too like we have to think about who to invite like for example annie we didn't follow up yeah i'm already pissed off with her like what is happening and is one of the persons who will always like my media and stuff like she always it seems she's following up what we do and she shares out from her social media we just like her first person that we want to invite uh always like we said like ah let's invite annie annie annie i think you have to contact her again yeah we'll do i'll do but it's just like so busy these days so i completely forgot about it but we will do it annie and me olivia olivia jack she's also a funny person to uh to invite you like olivia so the olivia exists i know i met her olivia is a real person he's not on her character i think ah but i never met annie so i don't know if she really exists i never met flor i really you never you haven't met any no i don't think so no so that's like the you know we have this list of virtual people like annie's uh one of the virtual people i met lisa and daniel from the you know like their collaborators so i know them but and i know olivia exists i don't know if floor exists or not we'll see next year yeah i hope she did what if it is like a laptop arrives maybe maybe maybe the floor is just it's a yes i bought from olivia yeah it's just like a laptop and i have to work with yeah i will be like yeah maybe we'll be so then when you're meeting her somewhere then it's just olivia walking and then she sits and she opens the laptop [Laughter] thing is like she just don't say anything even hello to you anything she just sits open the laptop and she starts drinking a coffee or something and then floating like hey now we'll see that might happen oh that's so so like for a plot for a movie like that the pro movie and this character olivia she's just sitting she crossed her legs and they started smoking and she heard it with a coffee or something oh my gosh and then you try to say something like to olivia and olivia did you keep some smoking oh my gosh so that's that's one thing i don't know that might happen next year and uh yeah we're we're looking for more people to have in the chat either real or virtual people really are we are we there's so many people that we have just to like contact we this list is endless that's just something that is giving me a headache we need to start like taking people like really to talk with some of these people or just like but the other idea i had i don't know if this was in the chat but uh like we could also contact people from like podcasts you know like doing already some podcasts not like because i'm saying it because then it's good for publicity and it's also good for like planning because they might have regular schedules so it's easier than you know scheduling with people we don't don't do this kind of activity they know the drill and i already found like interesting podcasts i i don't know if it's directly related but you know we'll see we have we should find like this uh i found this kind of queer craft open source podcast through the creative commons um conference which sounds really interesting i haven't checked their episodes yet but uh just just watching them talking quite was quite interesting and uh we'll see yes that sounds fun yeah daniella we have to buy the new house for putin oh yeah i will see her in a path meeting at 12. i see okay so the spring meeting is done like it's it was until the last weekend or yeah yeah yeah it was uh until sunday i guess it's sunday i think saturday is the last day and sunday just cleaning four months everybody's saying goodbye and make sense of them um i left them the other day after you right that day was nice that that was nice and yeah the house was getting crazy and more crazy so i think um yeah we have like this massive party like in i mean in the in the cave there was i guess people many people didn't have the chance to be together in a place like that there was a lot of excitement um happening um yeah that's crazy like i woke up at some point i go to bed around say 3 30 something like that i woke up at seven and then i'm checking and doing the uh yeah cleaning alba beads like the food and stuff like this and then i see like there's still like five people talking like from uh yeah and the same time then people who wake up in the morning for colleagues uh uh eddie you know like you see all these fresh faces and those who just standing kind of like these zombies they're talking healthy people and unhealthy people exactly that was the feeling i got and me i was in between i felt in between yeah i just took a shower and still i was tired and you know nice so [Music] what else i mean i have time so i'm really easy but uh i guess or maybe we can go to backstage yeah yeah i think so i think we can close the either backstage and talk about bad things about people yeah we don't do that you don't do that yeah that's true we don't do that so much that's not happening that's not true all right thank you for watching uh we are back so this is real life [Music] ciao thank you for watching please subscribe and uh please comment comment what yes you like coins is there a theme or just run okay ciao", "8QAd-VyRWL4": "okay so this is going to be the last chat for this residency and i started rolling the camera yeah i'm ignoring naoto and you guys for a second so now i have this quick ah store actually i'm not a talkative person but so i rarely talk a lot but somehow this dinner i was talking a lot well having a conversation it's quite loud dining um room so my voice is kind of dying um yeah quickly aging here some points for the 1970s the body keeps the score this is like funny drawing i don't know if you can see it but it somehow it looks like reminds me of pokemon like eevee like one of those evolved eevee or something okay hello hello hello now we're back yes i was arranging a gig like the lights in this place in funky in kent that is an amazing place it's unique of its kind in kent with this the way you create this live design with designers like designers from leicester and yeah so that'll be great i will be doing some cratorial uh processes there where i invite light designers to work with me there oh that looks like something super cool for me as a light designer interesting yeah and it's well paid i i spent like two months in leipzig oh yeah you know some artists i mean i know friends are like doing sound mostly i don't even know where is this but that's germany leipzig here like east one hour south of berlin shall i read something just because i just opened this book yeah so it says that nothing is perfect an unpleasant woman and nothing is perfect an unpleasant woman said on television tonight i should think of my sin my stink that the next person you turn to might be the only one you will ever have a chance to love more than yourself that i statue is not a fiesta that snow makes so little noise that the car goes by slow down stops back up pauses the motor ringing and drives off it is midnight and october in america the small towns are left to the leaves that was part of a quickly aging here some points of the 70. yeah actually you heard it before because i just read the title okay so this is part of a poem by dennis trudeau trudello okay that's kind of maybe not reminds me but um so there was the meetings like meeting started opened yesterday and the spring meeting yeah it was happening today today we have the first session yeah for three hours where uh georgia i don't remember her last name was giving a talk you're sharing some practice um i think i won't go too deep in that because i don't i'm not sure if i completely understand what she was speaking so i rather don't say yeah i mean i i can't say anything i was like i left at some point i mean you know i mean also she acknowledged that you can be you know out or walking around things like that yeah i fall asleep yeah uh planning not playing the pricing yeah and now we actually we have like new ideas can we say it yeah yes of course because it's already published exactly no no like because then that was a published one but then after that we talked about the other idea ideas so afterwards we really spoke about motion capture perhaps your business but then what are you are we doing with motion capture yeah yeah and it was based on this project that i have to do for the school that it was part of this class of entrepreneurship where the project of a semester was creating a company based on all the political i mean all the bureaucratic steps that you need to take and make it realistic and basically work with numbers right so how much money you need to really start the business how long it takes you to well i mean because basically a business process proposition is about like what is it called the keep the key value proposition and so that's the first thing then you need basically to ask for money so then you clearly you speak about numbers after you said to somebody like this is the proposal this is the unique opportunity then you say like this is the money that i need for this incredible proposal and because this is the way i'm gonna use your money in my business plan i will i will break even in this time and then you will do a call to action that's but well i was sharing now to this project that i have to do and then there's the like different packages like small package medium one large one and in the last chat we talked mostly like i talked mostly about the large package i think and then we were discussing like how like what would be the smaller ones and yeah we actually we didn't close that conversation we we stayed quiet for some time in the because i mentioned tonight was like one of the today the idea of this proposal so it was called like serious move and it was a motion capture company that basically proposed like two there were two focus on production there was one like creating content for uh so 3d content in a way i guess motion capture 3d content and the second one was creating installations and that was open and then authors are asking me like which kind of installations during the chat like uh what was acknowledged in my research also was a part of the research was clear that the growing there was like one of the more rapid growing uh industry is the music industry in this in this field because they they they use and they will use more and more cgi's so computer generated imaginary and 3d images and motion capture and also because this is becoming more and more accessible before was only possible with com for companies with a lot of budget like hollywood hollywood kind of thing now you can do that with just uh little users you can do without fairly you can you can do that good stuff with some decent budget but then we were talking of yeah like we also was like question like question me like or we were just like going back and forth with what is the price basically like we were creating different scenarios though yeah we're trying to get solutions you know because it depends on well i don't know if that's the scenario i mean yeah there are so many variables like client-wise also like what technologies we use and you know they're like all variables so we have to like so for me it was easier to see like other examples like other artists in like they say media art who's working for this kind of like music videos for example we unfortunately we don't know the price but uh i think it's good starting point to situate where we are and what kind of you know like band or artist we can kind of target you know like what one hey what was it that i was i was sure i'm gonna throw this idea of what it was oh yeah so one of one of the things that basically so this all of these are viral right but one thing that is for sure is that um with this video that we are talking here is somehow like what i call like best practices buddha uh that we are saying like we need to find more catching for that but so far that's what i call it uh like and this involves all the process that we did and we published in youtube all these processes that will be available for for you guys like to check these things which i think is very useful because as i share with now when i start working with these things like i was very like information about these things are not easy to find so i will if back then i would have found videos uh like this one about it that will feel um very grateful so um so one thing that we could agree is that a part of the variable so their barrels was that at some point we need to start basically build uh start basically working so because we don't have the work as dual in this kind of things but we have scattered experiences in different fields individual individual which i think is good also because like now auto has worked a lot doing technical stuff i work as bj dj art director marketing uh content creator different things so i think that we have complementary skills for these jobs but as i do it and in this specific field which is about it's a design agency in a way that search for clients to provide a service or a product [Music] we need to basically be trust by some say muse band to create their next single so they so this is something that we agree that that will be at some point uh somebody will give us opportunity and then then we have to see uh yeah that was part of the numbers like nauto was asking me like so like from trying to put a concrete scenario how much would that be uh and taking into account so all these variables that we just spoke but then one thing that we agree that's what i'm trying to say is that this is uh something to consider in terms of pricing that people need to trust on in us and that will that come comes to uh that means money basically that we have to negotiate and basically lower the price certainly the first time until we get some trust on uh from clients you know trust or like portfolio basically like what exactly works we've done yeah yeah yeah exactly yeah yeah because basically the portfolio is trust yeah that's that's the that's the thing yeah yeah and these digital agencies like you see for instance will like add some noise that i work then there's like digital agencies they like portfolio is that's the first thing you will see like does the real the presentation real is there's something that they update every month and they have a they're really that's the thing uh and they're super short like i think it's like one minute less than one minute and and so it's very dynamic with all these things you know yeah like we also like started making the mood board for these things like what yeah again like what other artists are doing i just came up with other another japanese artist who's working a lot with music people a lot but yeah quite often with music videos baku he's he's super good like she's he's actually uh he was studying at sfbc the school for quite a competition so like zach was you know his mentor baku and baku's uh his practice is very interesting like he uses houdini and so he's like he makes like super nice visuals but like also based on like algorithmic algorithmic models and you know it's very like nice balance of aesthetics and complexity that's what i found quite from how the coding allows you to realize a programming language so i'll add him to the best i mean i'm nothing compared to him but just as a reference yeah holding one of these things like one of you because now i'm following this thing uh designer uh there's a long course that is still i think it just finishes in august so it was running from january to august wow long course and then you basically go the whole idea thing is called like completely understanding of general generative uh procedural and then as you go you go through howdini and the designer passing and then at some point as you pass redshift uh different render engines like to really have an insight of how the these things work in a in a low level um but then through this process that i didn't follow i think maybe it's just five percent of the course um something that it was clear to me is like this thing is all about pipelines and then how once you understand how the pipelines work then basically then you start like by the piping differently these things and then the way how you work between houdini and enters design but yeah forgive you as i was just to say that houdini seems i think if you understand something like houdini then yeah it gives a lot of flexibility all the things that you can do with that not only rendering high-end images but then use it in different ways yeah it's it's very procedural exactly yeah yeah that's what i found it's like really interesting like balance or like really like too like you know like edge of this procedural like crazy mathematical model but also it's not like processing kind of minimum minimal thing but you can go to like this rendering stuff that you can pursue both at the same time and the interface is quite like you know it's not based it's not basically yeah is it it's exactly it's from it's from the the river they're very derivative well it's it's where the derivative of the river they really deviate they mediate it and then create a designer but then it's like if you have a working boat i mean all houdini enters designer then like they use the same names for things but the difference is like let's say for that uh the blue uh note in touch designer which is about 3d images let made 3d content that is called you know like yeah the blue designer is about 3d objects okay um yeah this job i think it's not jobs for data top is for uh images anyway it's the blue one and but then the same say from the like like for primitives you have i think a very let's just leave a little i don't know point dot sphere taurus there are a few ones i know a bunch few ones but then if you open that in houdini is sandless it's really really long the amount of primitives that you have [Music] yeah i like that in different things yeah i think probably like maybe with this we close the two decide i think but what i understood with touch designer is that um such designers if you really understand that how to use it that i would like to use it more in that way it works as a media server and something that allows you to it's like a swiss knife that allows you to connect actuators and then it has already plugins to work with uh unreal unity i don't think unity but unreal knowledge uh holding so although it has the capability for create working in 3d images and people use it like that and particle systems and things like that that's the way i learned it it's just basically uh it's a media server that you can use yeah okay and that was what i have to say about derivative i don't know if you want to say something uh i mean regarding this no now i started to really wonder if the camera is actually capturing you because it's really weird uh it is capturing but it's probably this will be nicer sorry but you are in the frame all the time what i want to say is i'm curious it's not something we define now but what would be the workflow let's say we might make a video music video and probably we will establish some kind of workflow and how it's going to be like because in practice we naturally well we kind of found it you know like you open live lab you have obs you hydra but then everything is like really next and it's like whatever but i guess if we do like music video it's going to be a bit more what is it not defined but you know but i think it's interesting because like first thing when naoto was showing like uh sharing this idea like with the business proposals uh then he was saying like development and he like opened frameworks development and and that's something that is cool because i work with that and there's something that i would like to work again um [Music] and i guess i naturally i guess i will go more driven to these node-based interfaces and and i guess that would be a process where i guess we have to go back and forth we think i mean say you have your workflow and then you have more code based things and i have my flow where is more node based and depending what you're doing or what i'm doing also at some point i have to understand what you're doing and uh so it will be it will be interesting like this let this populate just the speculation is very exciting like how to deal with these things could be very stressful also because this computer is just like like to deploy something like the first the first show would be stressful i mean well if it's music video you know we have to render video yeah somehow i don't know all of it yeah but it's just it's a post-production thing it's true yeah yeah yeah yeah it's it's a completely different game if you're just like real time there is not actually there somebody was telling me like some of the teachers connected with away at some point was saying somebody was like acknowledging they were saying like wow you're in such a role uh these days you're enrolled um things that are happening in my career my first professional career and and one of the things that the guy was saying was acknowledging saying that something about like the real time because there is that's something that i really want to do because it comes natural to me because of dance i guess like the real-time aspect of data or the the real aspect of working with these systems um and that's not that something that not necessarily many people will do because also there is some it's so so more you're more vulnerable for things to go wrong because it's live rather than you will find like rather more people working in post production for vjs or cr or content creators who uh create their content so basically they just post produce a video and then maybe sometimes they will use those videos in in in geeks uh but the product the generative production of this content is not something that uh many people will do true yeah even [\u00a0__\u00a0] will create this content in that way they won't risk basically yeah that is like mixed and the effects is added in the video yeah but what i'm saying is like even though they can create because many i mean a pga that is that that's something that i learned is that within dj community like you respect like somebody when they can create their content because you can buy packages but what they're very often this is like where like peter is a vijay and he creates very much of his content and his narrative and that's something that you you uh you respect within vgs somebody who can create his own content but it's still like that it's like a standard the people won't uh create generative content within a gig they will create their content in post in in post-production or and yeah they will just do the addition of a video that will just create this content and then they will use it as a video uh in a bunch of uh videos as a loop yeah yeah i mean i did i don't know if it was the performance probably like 20 minutes with a musician friend well no longer a friend i mean that's the long story we don't know we did the residency together and we made a performance and i coded everything in processing but yeah doing this for 20 minutes in processing only hell like i was like after that and life that was life yeah and yeah after that i was like you know i'm not gonna do this again it's just like so much work and you know like for i mean what's difficult i found with processing or like this like really like generated like code based images is like it's so boring that see the image okay three seconds you get it so like it's just boring and then vga software you have all kinds of effects that you can make it interest look interesting although not many things are happening yeah that's my impression yeah of course so i mean in the end i had to do the same thing basically it's a processing but adding shaders and shading strainers so it's time so it makes like you know images but these things i have to build by myself and then you know all kind of presets cues and it's like yeah basically making the vga software by myself i mean it was nice i mean i i'm really proud of it i mean i could you know still i feel like this part was more repetitive repetitive and kind of could be better or something like that but yeah i mean i was happy about it but at the same time i was like no i'm not going to do this again because it's just so much work and you just show it once yeah so i don't know if i want to do it again but what i didn't want to say yeah just response to what you said what else so so this is like the official closing of uh or residents in pub together but remark like wrap-up of the residency like that like to summarize what happened yo what did you discover or oh yeah yeah sure like yeah yeah yeah how what do you feel like how do you feel how was it like you're back to the dance circle yeah that's what i meant i'm about to do something here so yeah circle moment um maybe i can ask the tarot oh cool there's a title i don't know how to work with it just give me one card and then i give me one card interpret yes so i get one and you get so you get one yeah and i get one and maybe as like because i think it's always three right so like present so this is for the audience wow oh my god this is so i have this um like sword five swords wow this is like the spanish uh cards you know like that's called barack espanola this i mean just the drawings but uh it comes with that explanation this is incredible yeah don't is [Music] what do you feel about it but can't can't speak no for me i don't know five stars what okay okay because it depends on the the side as well so they have different explanation yes why okay ah yeah which side it was to be honest but i know but i i started with this side so it was actually facing up so that's good it is good i don't i don't know it's good i i interpret as something good i mean we can i mean we can play it without the description right you just have to interpret by yourself somehow so and for you for you is this maybe actually i don't see it and then i just show it to the camera and it's it's up to you how you interpret for people for people yes for you watching for you you on you and i would not see it until i well i don't edit the video i'm not the youtuber i don't edit the video i just upload it like that yeah but um you know like i think it's nice that it's not like you know we didn't get like an emperor or something so it's i feel like this you know it wasn't like a step but it's not like we ended somewhere it's not like something magnificent sorry what the cars i'm talking about i don't know what's what you got but otto is talking about cars yeah like it's not like you know something that's boom so it's you know we just made it uh another step with the card yeah because it's not like a you know king or emperor or something like that wow okay i see what i mean yes and we will come back or not i don't know yeah but um yeah well we will have more steps in the future in this project well i'm not a project but framework framework work to frame try not to say it yeah it's also like funny this world project like like i always say this word but at the same time like you know like it's just weird yeah it feels like within a project there is this labor there that's how i feel about it i mean a project is something that i have to do but it's cool that's right here that's a project yeah and also like uh i think one of the martin's video like he was saying you know like no one finishes artwork or it's something that no one thinks of peace and work in a project and then because i think what's funny is because he then he says something like you know what you mean by project is that you go to the cafe and work on laptop that's like working on the project so i think it's nice we have a framework that can you know framework it's so cool because it's this idea of the container inside of the container container container container which is very much about like this web design at the core for those who don't know what it is front end the way that you join there's just blocks there's just boxes that you need to draw to understand everything that you see in the web are just blocked so like do a favor to your code the stuff for the developers and just draw boxes yeah so you have view js react svelte best practices yes yes it is indeed npm install that's right oh man we still have wow but yeah this best practice could be a no package no but no no no probably it exists best practices i don't know maybe maybe check i'm gonna check if not then we just have to work like then you have to upload it on to npm if not nobody's used that name yet right we can make best practices in contemporary dance without space or anything you just put a hashtag you just put a string for now so best practice is just that without space i have without space without just all together no capital letter nothing no exact match no there's something called eslint config best practices no but that's uh we should just create that to claim that space before it's gone true like just to put it like a string anything inside oh no but there's best dash practices the description is weird a package using versioning best prices years ago version 0.0.0 wow thank you for taking that that maybe maybe that was the two guys like you and me working and they thought at some point oh let's just take the space because we're gonna make a package and they never did it so maybe we do that also will happen we just take space for the next ones wow imagine this this is pretty much like rick and morty i'm obsessed with rick and morty and the missionaries these days that's what makes me happy and that is jumping constantly dimensions so then imagine so because it makes somehow sense like it was you and me in another part another dimension somehow but after this meeting they said like alice just let's claim the space i said like just best practices best uh dash practices and and just put whatever inside and say oh we're gonna just work on that but i just leave it and now we are here after 10 years in other place and then [Music] we are saying this is already claimed he's already claimed that one but then we are saying okay let's just use the one without so all together best practices and we just put whatever and the next 10 years another you and me will open and say like oh maybe best practices in contemporary dance and let's put whatever and then we just work but we never work 0.0.1 what was the versioning 0.0.0 it was 0.0.0 so even they didn't fix a bug that they didn't even fix the bug because the best practices they just claimed space exactly this user called jesus magnificent magnifice mail made like an email mail wow [Laughter] that's that's something that's even bigger than best practices it's like christ wow jesus christ yes oh my gosh thank you yes so wait but we are just like diverging this is like we have to focus like we are so we have been here for 10 days yes right and we have been like traveling for two weeks two weeks like two weeks this is the longer period that we have been sharing space um that's been nice man cool like the sn was great after the condition that we have were like so good you know messing was great the festival was amazing people were great uh it was good and also we went home you have your space also there i have the time also to recover thank you thank you by the way i never told you eva was really uh glad uh glad she was very grateful when i talked with her when we arrived here or something the day after she said to me like ah thank you for cleaning the space and uh and so she said to me and i said like yeah of course that was not me i mean i when i clean when i leave the space if i travel i will clean somehow but this i mean she would never say like thank you for cleaning the space i guess it's i guess the way how you you really make sure you're really clean the it was like proper so this message is for pro is the second time for julia and that now open let the space cleaner than how he found it because even my couple she realized and she acknowledged that she thought she never said that to me and she said like she was really like saying that oh thank you for like you know that for her it means like that i care and then i said like yeah love i wasn't it wasn't me obviously and they said yeah i thought so yeah anyway till now thank you for that thank you for saying yeah so yes we were there at home and then after we came to puff after a journey such a journey now we can laugh about it i mean well yeah we when we get the money we can laugh about it yeah because now we're in the process and the legal procedure of getting eight years back 18 18. it says eight euros eight euros four actually cost ninety actually jesus christ man not cool not coolest nbs know cool belgian trains by the way i had so many problems with this uh sncf the french training company the website is awful i for some reason if i collect from puffs wi-fi it's like at one point it's getting blocked yeah it's just terrible maybe they're already they know i made that again this ip address that is from that place blocked them so i had to like connect to the you know the cellular network and then it worked then it worked yeah it happened to me also when i tried to do the same you know how i bypassed that in my computer then i used a vpn from my school then and then it's then it works but then some some pages they won't open because it's not safe basically because they there is a disconflict that this is somebody in between so don't give a back information blah blah blah and i cannot open the page basically yeah like i'm using a bpm to watch rick and morty because netflix in france doesn't have weekend working oh excited where you are yeah yeah because you can travel and you can still use netflix yeah everywhere like but then the content will change drastically yeah so yeah so going back to so we have been traveling uh for quite some time and then here this is we have been doing we have been working a lot uh the same time enjoying life and uh yeah i think it was great that uh feel uh very happy you finally you could come here and experience something that you cannot tell it's just you have to experience space and and also take the time and you took the time to be here um so like for instance if you compare your first days with the last days you are completely you're in a different dynamic with the space and the your agency within the space for the people food like work health all these things totally yeah and these things yeah you cannot really like that's why i've always have been like uh close with the idea of our documentary because of that like sometimes the people come here say like we would like to do a documentary about buff and always the clothes the the the reviews yeah that's more like jenna was like he don't like that yeah because of that because the documentary has a gate and that's something that it's very open exactly what if someone comes to us and they want to best practice whatever man like that that visibility all all in like even if somebody wants to come to just like speak bad about it i will like i gladly invite somebody to criticize it also like anything that is just like it's a proposition to uh actually i mean to be honest like when i would like what i would really appreciate is somebody would like to uh communicate with us you know like so if you guys uh want to speak or you know like would be nice just basically i think the idea to make publishes videos is like as we said in the research is since there is not too much documentation about dance and technology or digital dance what is basically to give a space for uh convert for a conversation or to initiate some dialogue some some communication i want to listen to my paragraph yes sure wait a second i mean that's that's what we used in the creative applications this is because there's a paragraph about that i mean yeah i mean like we brought together and i think i converted somehow i created more into a specific thing about it you can read it creativeapplication.net is that right okay fine best practices in contemporary dance is a queer form conversation blah blah blah blah blah okay there's a history of dance tech since the 20th century from oscar schlemmer to maurice kaingan and namjoon peck to today's notable figures such as maria judoba troika phi biology raphael gilbrand to name a few and maybe you um nevertheless the artists believe the artist us believe that the field of fantastic is still in its early days rather than using technology as a service for dance piece or vice versa quarters artists dancers and choreographers needs to develop a vocabulary to accommodate technological flesh and embodied code as a practice then dance tech will no longer be an interdisciplinary collaboration but become a discipline in itself i'm really proud of this line by publishing practice and chat videos they contribute we contribute to a wider audience in the community to stimulate practice based approaches yeah wow so i think like like that yeah like it's like to stimulate basically that dialogue exactly um so but why we were saying this oh yeah not because of the the labor because of the work that we did like so we have been here and i think how many chats did we need in this time during this residency yeah um so i found actually with this video i think it's 11 videos in total like chapter practices so now we did just one two three practice performances so like eight i think eight chests wow and we have been here eight and ten days wow so it was just only two days that we did not chat but you know what like 10 days for me like it's including the day we arrived which is actually already the next day we came here yeah like it was like midnight around right and then 10 days also including tomorrow morning so in fact it's eight to four days so it's actually one per day yeah if you average it eighty hours wow so i guess some days we did more than one time yeah yeah there was something yeah we did like twice like quite often oh yeah wow wow that's a lot of player we work a lot and one first thing was incredible you know you might not notice but we actually talk while the cameras are rolling yes yeah we talk but something becomes weird because we can't speak freely don't talk don't talk there's no freedom of speech like i think all this i want to say don't say it yet don't say it yet wait wait or when people ask us sometimes like when we just did the performance and they want to ask something and then we just answered no we cannot do it now because we want to do it in the chat first that's weird yeah true this always reminds me like i i also i say it all the time it's a chinese garden in frankfurt where we often go from you know most long term whether the node video was like you know this nice uh park uh nearby in this chinese garden and that's where we you know have the chat without camera so i i feel i feel like puff i feel actually like puffy like the chinese girl yes it's the way how i feel true yeah puff is like the whole puff yeah you have the extension yeah you find a portal in that chinese garden like rick and morty portals they have portals they throw portals and the chinese gardens forces the gate so maybe that's where we enter off wow wow maybe there is really somewhere wow you can go back to the chinese garden yes maybe it's there somewhere here man maybe one of the books if you really move it it will just open when there is a green stuff like enrique morty like green flashy thing like with a twirl like wow maybe one of these books really will open something wow both there are many books [Laughter] many options yeah there are different libraries so wow it would be nice to go back to frankfurt well no but but i think it's gonna be known maybe next year there will be would be nice right yeah i'm curious about how yeah also note was like like new now was really like you know pushing this queer aspect but i think node is also you know trying to push that as well like aside from like this really community i think it's kind of interesting balance because he's really like nerdy nerdy because that's not like that's the thing that i understood like in time that like those desire like he's like are people who are nervous i mean he's like yeah he's like it's a different vibe like indeed you're like just ignored but you're really it's just nerds is really low level computing so you really need to understand code yeah it doesn't even say it's a visual whatever it's like multi-purpose toolkit yes exactly i think that's what it's called it's a multi-purpose toolkit voila the swiss knife and the the swiss knife the description exactly yeah so anyways um node uh if you're watching please invite us again yes and uh yeah i don't know where the next destination is but as we will see each other in belgium yep because i want i want to make these people also because we'll be good also for the future yeah we'll try to work we'll figure out yeah uh but it's going to be you know like short yeah yeah yeah like for work i guess we'll be i mean in the same space i guess will be in germany in january yeah yeah the choreographic coding lives yeah yeah yeah that'd be nice and also like i i but also like when you're coming back from japan in december right yeah yeah well perhaps yeah but i think uh not like physical space same critical space but uh what i really wanted to push is this idea of like me being in at white camp in japan the center for arts and media i'm planning to visit there um we're in touch and like i hope to do something there hopefully you practice while you're in motionbank because they also want to do something together so i think we can be the you know ambassador well besides all these political things i think it's nice to do a practice between germany and japan from germany belgium whatever europe yeah quite interesting ambitious yeah actually i'm looking forward to just back to go back to the black the sandbox yeah like yeah yeah just go back to the wood all day that's so nice this is so cool yeah nice thing is we can go always go in and out so now we know yeah because it's like one yeah one year ago we were about to meet one when we think we meet like it like it was in october like it was like the first like this fifth of october or something like that what's the presentation it was showing maybe something exactly i think the because notes started on the second of october yeah ah we made like 28 i mean i was i was there from like a few days before the festival and you came around time when it was opening yeah then they before yeah it was open yeah so probably like 28 almost one year ago because today is 29 yeah yeah wow one year ago yes so many things and now we have a business plan with numbers and stuff exactly please call us please write us if you have projects if you want to have music video if you want interactive website webpage i don't know whatever if you if you want to practice please let us know i mean it's not just business you know what's something that i'm thinking like now is like i was thinking like maybe we should just like kind of like lay out these things that we made in a proper way and then put it in a website uh for business but at the same time i was thinking like say that we put this like we we presented with and we kind of like send it to some vip as just oh kind of opening something so i'm testing something but then i thought like what if actually we just get like right away some response for people like oh you know what yes i would like to make a website or something and like i'm busy like you're busy also like next year also you will be busy but it's that's tricky because at the same time then we can never then we can never start yeah that's the same thing that we thought personal things with my my personal life that i have this conversation with eva then but it's true like because i'm kind of like saying like now is not the best moment because i have just this time and then january and then these and then that but it would be like this always but but i won't say i mean it's not something i should say in front of the camera but that's why i frame it you know this would take three months for example like this project this package of the installation even like website will take three months but like what i think is like in my in my workflow that's something there's conflict but it generates a conflict in the way who i work because like i see that at the same time you're working different things you kind of you split your day and you can do different things when i work like with the person when i work with marco i when i work with you then i just put all my my time there um so that's something that already i see like that could be conflictive but i guess this is just a matter of habits and i don't know like okay so what i would say is i i frame it three months but like real working time is probably less than one month so that's why we can somehow you know shuffle juggle and fit the schedule like that's why like it's contingency uh i shouldn't say that from the camera because then if you're looking if you're watching your clients you would say yeah then you can do it in one month and you can pay you know a third of the price but that's not how it works in business right so for example if it's an installation and if you you know if someone asks us right now we can still if we want to if we can manage it yeah yeah sure that's why i train like that yeah yeah okay now it makes sense no maybe we just like try it yeah because it's nice because we have a document just we have to uh we have just to lay out then actually and then i kind of start like then i can design something something and then just put it in some skeleton yeah but if we get like all these offers from colombia and argentina you have to pay the travel expense though wow and oh my gosh what i'm saying but we are happy people right now they're very happy that's that's what i want to say yes i'm i'm brilliant yes okay yeah we're just finish like as like normal because i don't want to say you know like a big thing about you know wrap wrap up like we did a big thing already we're wrapping up a lot of work but yeah please i don't know if you have any final words you are la france they all la france because they giving my ticket on friday for half price yeah because it was the friend it was the french day it was but i said people are friends it was the daily life something yeah good for you yes i have to pay the full price anyways okay so thank you for watching please like the video i hope uh you actually the ones you watching until now most likely you're already liking the video but thank you subscribe to the channel share it and share it talk about it talk and also like yeah just interact criticize just like like yeah dialogue dialogue very nice and write to us maybe we have to start like doing like drastic things in the videos for people to start thinking to really go and see it like maybe next time we can propose now to be naked for instance you know like something i don't know like we can't i mean we are open always to listen ideas well i just thought it was like so because then it's going to be banned uh on youtube so why don't we upload a chat on pornhub i don't think you can just upload like these things and no i heard you can because they're also like i don't do your videos but yes true but i guess they should what if there is no sexual content i don't know but i mean if you're naked and talking maybe probably it's okay it's true [Laughter] [Laughter] at some point we'd receive a letter or an email from pornhub like hey guys this is what are you doing this is confusing people and we can reply you know you want to join the chat that's a guess it's always the quickest okay yeah we will continue uh after this yes thank you for watching", "fG-Zr_W3-XE": "so do you want to give a pitch yeah yes should i open the door or you're going to open the house i'm going to also glue the dog in the in our shared drive is it recording it's recording so check to do something called ortiz morning plan okay uh let's just finish is it in the shared folder yeah okay started timer oh it's a presentation i want to see how long start so um my money plan consists of i divided in two points the first point is where uh is it's related with art liberal art possible which is possible through funding the second is the sun applied creativity and it's possible through clients so then the [Music] one aspect that i found in liberal art is so i call it 1.1 is a hybrid performance and then i found that the living cost which means like the house plus the travel expenses those are variables because depending where are we going the house will change and also it travels second aspect is the tech buying or renting and then depending on the scope of the project there's a variable as well uh the payment which is subdivided into categories one is food the variable depending on the space again and then work payment that is something that uh would be nice to start going forward and this uh i i assume i said like has to be plus 50 euros so at least 50 euros or more per day in developed countries uh so say that yeah developed countries we go to other places then we can negotiate this ratio um so that's the artist that's the artist one i found that just that's i call it one point one one branch they should be other branches and the second point which is about design and clients then i basically hold more like a pitch what is the unique value proposition and i said the 2.1 uh proposition is that the is a web design for art and tech best practices below involves the client within embodied full stack process the added value relies on the time to develop something that is functional within a process that understands and responds to the needs of the clients insights through the possibilities they actually have a really good insight through what are the states of the order web technologies and actually they can understand what is the problem or what are the features that maybe they need to implement um and i think so that added value as we were talking some time ago some days ago is that we favor the client and we try to go with the client for him or she to understand what is actually the problem or what is the what is the functionality that that the specific client needs in their website because as you know very often the client doesn't really know what they want and since it's our artistic propositions then the future will uh will be very different from client client uh and the second point two points or two point two was about motion capture and then i stopped but that's basically you help someone using motion there are different ways because this is a motion capture i can copy paste because i did my my business that i did with the numbers and all these things little stuff for my school and so i have a whole pitch for that and so there are different ones but uh so yeah maybe i will i will not speculate with that but i just will open the file module cool um i have to say it's a good introduction to my plan because my phone is basically just numbers this is what i thought i think is perfect that's that's and by the way this is confidential so we're not going to share the screen so this is oh yeah yeah yeah it's not confidential it will like you know show it at some point but i think it's nice to document this and actually so now you know what services you you can get from us yes what is the unique value of proposition the eubp and how much does it cost uh let's go to the next to my document which is also in the folder if you want to yeah take a look where is it i just added it best price practices pricing all right so maybe i follow the same flow which starts from the artistic works like if we work as an artist is at the bottom basically i took this number from another project that i wrote here but i didn't say so i think it's roughly like the same idea so i thought like in this case i put the living cost and artist fee together as like around 3k per month per person okay but that doesn't include lodging like accommodation travel expense and we also need workspace uh and material post whatever we need so basically aligned with what we said and i think like this is a bit tricky thing like it depends on the funding so we could probably negotiate for cheaper price um but i think that's the baseline i would say yeah i think we should we aim for something there's more and then negotiate from there than just like go from cheap and then exactly yeah yeah um now the corporate uh like client works are the more complicated one well i have different categories good the most is it the most expensive yeah the most expensive ones are like basically interactive like this installation like open so for example uh this is the case uh i don't say pre-order client um but like if i say that is interactive display either monitor or projection with some kind of tracking for example like you can actually interact with the system yeah i budgeted uh 35k let's say minimum we need like three months yeah and uh 15k is for like open frameworks or any kind of like front-end visualization development including the technological art like computer vision and stuff yeah uh 5k for back-end we need to like i guess it's important to have like sharing options so you can send it to your phone send it to your twitter um design [Music] and 10k or other management stuff it wasn't very cool so it doesn't i think that's something that should be there yeah oh yeah yeah like i just put like this like 10k as like direction management be marketing yeah and the idea is so i wrote this scenario here that i would probably take most of the development fee depending on how much i outsource to other people and let's say you do the design but of course design is cheaper so we're gonna depending on how we how much we work we will balance with the rest yeah and i think that's gonna be fair yeah yeah so that applies to that as well um next one maybe it's yeah i can see it too so let's say like similar project but it's not that we deliver something but if we work as a consultant okay i budgeted like 6k per month uh for like technical things and this is 6k is like a venue for for a budo like for the for us is that the individual or the other painting individual okay so like very technical thing that actually from my experience okay yeah just just as a note and let's say we have non-interactive display so it's like showing some visuals that doesn't include cameras for example okay but it still receives data from somewhere else like can be also weather or it can be you know stock price or whatever yeah that kind of i would call it like non-interactive but still generated display is a little bit cheaper because i don't need to do the computer vision of this sensor stuff so i pushed it front-end 5k back in 5k design 5k and the rest 10k for the direction management marketing good market plus material [Music] basically it's around the same like so but the tricky thing i would emphasize that we would only do like a single page with some kind of transition within the page but like we don't make for example blogs or like this kind of thing that has like many pages so that is just one one pager yeah one page right yeah yeah yeah it does just just to make it simple but that doesn't mean that we make it simple but we focus on like uh more about interactions within the page and that's that's the state of the art in uh web design is now is where one page yeah and let's say yeah one pager um 25k yeah it sounds like the same idea from n5k back in college and just mk uh let's say that takes like three months but of course it takes longer it will be more expensive and but what is special about us is we have an another option to include for example camera interaction or some kind of uh more complex interaction with webcam or something else yeah and that will add 10k uh to the previous one so it's gonna be 3d 5k and that 10k goes to the basically the computer vision or the development of javascript so and i think that's pretty much it i also wrote like we do like client works as like you know client as other artists i don't know because if i look at these numbers what do you mean what is that like more cultural thing that someone asks us to let's say like this other artist who wants to make up webpage on their name and then which is their as their work this is like i think realistically for two of us i think it's very difficult to budget unless they have a huge budget yeah we have to think yeah also yeah also because i know like the yeah what is our details then like with contracts at least always in belgium which i think is the same in europe it's based on european law is that normally when you work like web design then you give the rights it's almost it's almost the case all the time in normal web design but i guess we can we have to pitch that within our work that is an artistic process and therefore we have we need to have some rights or we give completing the rights that is the case this is the case reason that you just give completely the rights for somebody and they can do whatever they want let's see that's that's not in value normally that's the way it works like yeah yeah this uh i didn't put it i didn't clarify that part i was thinking that at least we need to with this pricing for the corporate clients we need to say that we did this work so that they don't have to create that has to be negotiated yeah but but we have to we can say that in our portfolio we did this work yeah yeah that's important that's the reason if that's not possible either the price will yeah then we have to dress up or we cannot do this that was good that was those 10 minutes yeah that was super super and we did this in 25 minutes so it's super efficient very productive wow oh yeah like this is something that i will i have in my hair for in abstraction for a long time and now it's taking some [Music] yeah and i think we didn't even plan to you know no because but it's not it's cool because it means that we are in line like for instance it's true like anyway how you split things also the way we've naturally been able to start writing things more how to pitch that more uh yeah create a uvp and all these kind of things what is more coming from design and marketing which is something that i have practiced i mean i'm doing the consultancy so it just seems very natural amazing but i want to talk more about i mean maybe not this round maybe later uh like how we can like frame the motion capture let's say consultant so then i would like to show you then my project but maybe let's first like uh eat lunch and then after uh then i can show you because i have a project with a real video in belgium all these things cool all the numbers and everything is there so if you are interested please write to best practices in gmail.com hello yeah it's called the best practices altogether.gmail.com yeah yeah best practice in gmail.com but in fact in on gmail you don't it doesn't matter where you put the period you don't as long as no actually they just take it out like from the gmail from gmail yeah it's true yeah yeah okay anyways so it's good and very very interesting so we were we are very excited to hear from you guys we are officially i think kind of i guess open for business we're yeah and we are available for now business we are uh we really have to work with you guys yes what if we get offers from colombia and argentina and japan yes because the people in those countries they are watching the channel youtube channel but then we can apply this thing yeah so that would be great you know like i don't want to work with language already yeah yeah of course no of course if you're watching from germany please please contact as well if you're interested yes yeah okay then see you later yes", "3hs0E63vYjU": "so hello before i fall we are at the ballroom and here uh the third version the third hybrid performance will happen which is our number these things so this is the number three so the one we did here the first one was doesn't come no because i was like yeah so the first one was that uh thank you class thank you thank you and the second one was upstairs and here's the third one here yeah and do we have like a huge problem but like can we do the same no we can do the same uh in the same place right a few times because we haven't done it i mean that path we did it upstairs but that was just once as a hybrid performance but then if a festival invites us to do like two three times then we have to do the same place true but we can have different numbers or we can say again 5.1 5.2 however we want yeah anyways good morning good midday it's like the name of this almost noon i mean good good day for your day that's really yeah australian good day thank you so kind of you where's god every time we do a joke i have to carry this thing around and when there's a joke i just go around searching for jokes makes me happy it's handy yeah somehow this morning i was searching for a cup and you know like cup with like proper handle like it's just hard to find yeah so this maybe we're going to start from there now it's been eight days since we arrived here so how how is that that was the last time i think we told us wednesday about i mean yeah i mean i feel more comfortable for sure [Music] i mean it's a wave uh frequency domain spectrum yes yeah yeah like it's it's just surprising it's like eighth day yeah including the first night right like still like the seven like like yeah almost full week well it doesn't feel like that that's my impression to say we've been doing a lot and not so much at the same time we've been doing a lot by really taking time yeah i mean but the thing is like i already have been here for six years so i know my doing here every time it's different but i have my the way yeah like first like i think rarely i will take a shower before [Music] quite early and then i enjoyed to be alone in the kitchen so 6 30 5 30 away from them start helping a bit for the house have my time for coffee then i will start working with many meals and stuff like that around 7 30 and then relax but then once you realize this now i mean for being awake from six already almost six hours let's see i'm away first 26 hours um so actually we haven't talked after the last performance how we didn't after daniela we didn't we didn't yeah well we talked in the media in the music room the day after a day after i yes what else so that was yesterday but we did some planning also did we talked about what to do we eat [Laughter] yeah so today i think hopefully we have an interesting connection yeah something will happen yeah and tomorrow what's tomorrow my last day tomorrow i mean i don't think we're going to practice tomorrow but we should at least have a yeah yeah yeah yeah because then i'm believing also to work because here you have so much space and time it's so easy to deal with heavy stuff but back in the century well for me like actually even like before this and after this i'm not in my flat but i will be traveling for the project so maybe it's in a way it's easier because like i will it will be busy but at the same time like it's not the reality i'm used to i don't know if there for me it's just hard because i like to it takes me time to like just be at home when i join home and also if i have to move and travel i mean i like what i work and stuff but the thing is hearing puff i can do both i can be myself and i can work so that takes me time until i can become filter these things that i don't want from from being in the city i'm from external factors and we share the desires between me but then in the city yeah it's different like if i'm traveling for work and stuff yeah i understand what you're saying because you are not in an environment there is just the same environment but for me yeah but i think for me like since yesterday i feel a little bit more like try to finish things so like you know just cross the to-do list yeah like this kind of buy because the first days i was just walking around and like just don't you know do other stuff which is just fine i think but now like i want to go for work again but i'll probably the weather is not so good today hopefully tomorrow is better i don't know but yeah like now i feel like but because also like i had some meetings yesterday like some calls so now i'm like yeah i think i'm slowly getting ready i think i'm good at kind of switching anyways i don't have like i can switch from hats and be like now this like lately like now i'm in my age like now how i feel is like i don't want to i mean as much as i can i just want to be something if there is one i don't want to have to switch to the things it just takes too much energy for me i understand what you mean i don't share it share what you feel but i i can't imagine and also like this place like you know makes you think because some people are a couple you know baby and you know these things really like like for me i don't really i don't know how to say um yeah like living living with people with family that makes me think yeah like how this yeah i can see the different realities it's funny like when we talk when we do a chat like i feel like we have like unlimited things to talk but like now i think it's nice to share the moment that it's like the silence before the storm yeah this island with echo i should like to start like traveling with a little microphone so i think some people do that you know like not this microphone but like some people with like proper equipment traveling like that's just insane like i truly admire them i mean also from video camera like anything like this equation i don't do it you know i have this little camera and i have what my biggest equipment is my mini desktop machine which way i don't know how much i don't actually a lot of cables [Music] something we haven't i mean there are things that maybe we can say that we still have time not today uh i think today will be not being realistic um but tomorrow there is time to we can use some time i mean i'm working in the morning so it's up to you like you want to that's the way i work more working in the morning like i work on the day i guess like in this office things but but at some point we can also work yeah as you saw like i mean well i don't wake up late but i like to like take time in the morning and then like i'd rather work in the evening and then [Music] like until i really sleep i like working working working and then i just go to bed which is i know it's kind of weird i think everybody has different like i have different periods like but like i think when i'm in puff i try to because also it's more like from noon that the houses are moving so i like try to go with the flow also like some people are talking and they don't have time to it's hard to do your own stuff after then also like trying to experience the house i think they can offer a network also social life and life drinks dogs all these things then i prefer to do some kind of work in the morning but yeah i also yeah i have also i mean i'm very slow as you saw in my house i'm quite slow so i need i always have like two hours until i really wake up hello [Music] um here and i think you guys are doing the opening up yeah yeah but the dinner like around i guess it will be like 8 30 yeah so we will finish [Music] [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] um there is no problem like the doors will be open so people are passing and this is there's no problem at all because it's not inspiring it's part yeah it's not there's no space there's privilege in one thing so but it's different if like let's say the plates are gonna move you know like this kind of like massive it is [Music] um [Music] um [Music] so i guess yes yeah i read the brochure and i think it's very in line with what we're working on that's great all right okay so what's your name eleanor that was hello this will be youtube so you can just [Music] so but we don't edit and everything is really in that spirit of climate so this will be online if you're okay with it again [Music] and she's part of one of the people who are organizing this spring meeting here yeah we didn't talk about it in the chat no earlier so there are meetings the way how like the path works is this big uh house it's an art residence and i think in short what makes it special is it's a it's a big house and in short because it makes it special because i have this conversation today with really also um and nothing in charge is what it makes in this space like that the possibility to just get lost in space not have to deal with things because of the space um so labor is very fluid so yeah so then there are meetings happening some some meetings per year and i'm trying to propose one meeting i mean you can have like kind of private meetings like you know i'm trying to propose a seats meeting here um but also there are like from initiatives to path like spring meeting and then you have different meetings so the spring meeting is happening now hopefully today is opening today from at six there is nice champagne officers yeah so that's that yeah that was that so that's we are in the ballroom and this is the way i normally i mean we set tables for people to to to eat here um the studio we used in the last practice will be the menu yeah it's like the bigger place they have for this and yeah the thing will pop so that's how it works normally you negotiate constantly right so we have to do something they have to do something it's not like you don't do that or i don't do that because i'm gonna tell somebody whatever this is my importance here this is my hierarchy but it's more about negotiation so i think that was an example good example that's the way we deal with these things and you don't have to be friends or you know each other because this is very routine in that sense is very rational i think so then basically this is something that is a collective so then basically my understanding is like you do the best you can to not bother um yeah yeah i see yeah so you don't necessarily have to create agents for the other one but just like you just take care within these four rules to not disturb the the other realities in a way to be uh invisible that that's my experience i think once you get uh that's not an inside joke that i hear from people who really stay here alone is that when you are more longer in path you are are like a ghost so you actually you give the space for the newcomers who are like wow this is here and it's here and so you give and if you want to do a party whatever they want to do then they just use the space within their own understanding of the space so there is not a police state here it's trying to exercise this freedom in that way but then nevertheless then there is a sensibility under the joke that you are a ghost and when somebody don't know where to put things in certain places or find them then you appear from behind the project like you can fight in there and then you go back and you disappear that's kind of like an essential ghost or a guardian spirit like i would say like this that some something like protects you yeah like we have so yeah thanks again thanks so i guess we close around here and yes in a way i mean we didn't mean to okay we'll have we'll make an introduction of the space but we just like today we didn't really you know think about it no and actually i think i think what is interesting is uh because at the core i mean this is a building but the building is alive there are things that are alive and i think at the core i think that was a good example how this is actually how why experience the interaction with other humans that for different reasons than you want to or not interact or engage in certain ways so then i will speak from my personal perspective my intentions um but in what it matters in terms of sharing space then just you negotiate yeah yeah so like there's no one way of experiencing it interesting you said it's really european or like it's like western i think like this individually in a way because i think this is really hard to do in japan for example because there is something that you know people yeah care too much talk about other people while they're not there yeah these things are so common and it's very hard to run something like this i mean i think our generation is becoming more different and like for example we don't do like room like we don't share with other people someone not from your family to have like room share like most of the places in the world i guess yeah in japan it doesn't happen and that's yeah i think it's connected to our society um yeah yeah i think in colombia will be like i cannot imagine right now uh meaning that people will speak you know like people would be really near family we also would be very much in contact with you in economy and stuff like that uh but the contribution and what you're saying is like in a room will be maybe not two but maybe five people you're allowed to invade a lot of the space of the old one away yeah people are very prominent everywhere so uh i guess i hope this will be uploaded before the performance that'll be interesting i'll see you later yes watching i i know you don't watch it because i know the average view time is like period which is actually good you know like it's not like three seconds at least people take time to watch it for a few minutes which [Music] and i know the sound is quite bad so it's kind of really fun to watch it but it's it's also for archiving so it's for archiving it's for art it's for archiving yeah i understood that i didn't respond sorry you", "7Xvc9k0rPDg": "all right so i'm the camera guy camera guy no please camera guy yeah that's why i think it makes sense what i was just telling him is that um i would call you there i feel like they becoming you today is that good day so they i was telling them so where are we first like hello uh so um we are in the music room this is the music room as you see so the music room um we use this place to smoke sometimes it's like you're not promoting that idea but that's what you do not just you open it what comes with the music yeah but then and then you open them and just make sure that you get clean and somehow um so i was just mentioning that so yesterday what we did is we shared path like it was the second time they would share uh openly uh uh they have a high performance of the best practices in contemporary dance right um it was so it was super last minute also because it was the way how it is i mean what we do also i have things to say about that but maybe that's not what i'm saying right now i'm trying to focus in the camera thing so i was just trying to mention them that i checked after after we finished this thing that did this for three hours uh so we daniella bachmann i think it's her last name if i pronounce it well um she stayed there for a while and then she has a similar format of i don't know i haven't seen her but like in things that we've spoken and she shared for some years is something similar that she keeps on expanding this thing that in her world in her world she called her this ocean and as you see in the way how she speaks about waves that's her imaginative going to her context on her text on her development um so so after that the then i checked at some point when i came back like uh the thing that we share in the importance so side to side basically and then i think it was kind of working organically because the camera which i think should be the ghost camera so it should be a third camera um what's your laptop so it's not only a static camera that stays in one place just to capture uh as a camera which is a an instrument outside i think if we use the camera as it's used now in the chat the camera stays as an element that is not within the practice it's just an element that is there to capture the image which i think is not so interesting for the hybrid format i think the camera should be part of what we do like also i speak this from from my experience working with video dance that i was working with dutch in 2002 where there is a specific formula there is not film and it's not dance but nevertheless it has a lot of uh elements from both and at the core there is this idea that is close to cinema where the camera moves like in tv or in documentary the motion of the camera is very minimal in cinema the core element of the way it happens there is more drastically in cinema is like there are a lot of different movements and dramatic movements and intentions with the camera in that sense video dance is closed so i think in the going back to the hybrid performance i think the camera should be alive as is in video dance or dance cinema therefore uh we did it in the impulse that without knowing that but the camera so it's not only the camera because first the camera has movement involved with it in the impulse lens but also you use it for code you use it for different things so it's not only the camera is camera but also you use it sometimes like yesterday sometimes also you were using your screen for camera but for other things and i think uh that make more sense to me than just have uh we also can keep this for ours for our thinking but as a choreographic element if you want to speak about choreography right now i think it makes more sense or is more meaningful to me that the camera within the choreography it must be alive not as a static element outside of the choreography that's what i was trying to mention with this with this long wrapping of camera i don't know if you if you get what i'm trying to say with this but when you say camera is it like which camera like being in the laptop the your surface laptop face camera the camera that you were using when you recorded the inputs and which i don't know which camera how many cameras do you have because there because there are two or three more different things oh wow okay it's also like okay sorry so this one no no but that's that's what i'm trying to figure out um because at imprisons i only had one computer yeah there's a tablet the service laptop target and also i think i connected the webcam so they're like all mobile you can move anywhere and i don't remember if we also i think we recorded with this uh little action camera for a documentation but you did not you did not upload this in i think i did because that's because i didn't record obs but then the question is what is there i just can show you is what you can see in best practices yeah i know that that's why it's really confusing yeah i'm also trying to figure this out yeah this is this is good this one what is this camera which is this this is you ob this is your yeah so the one on the best practices page from july 31st is this action camera because it's actually looking at the laptop and the rooftop and because this actually camera i cannot connect to anything else it's just recording so i cannot use it in live lab for example okay but i was just moving around to see what could be interesting for a documentation because people can't see it in real time right but then you see it live and the reason why i did it is because i couldn't record it with obs because my computer is not that's true okay but i uh i mean i think it still is valid what i was saying yeah because i want to expand from that because on the other hand from the performance yesterday how i did is this action camera was static basically perspective like you know like arrow to the yeah and then the cameras i had were one is the webcam that's connected to my desktop so that's not completely mobile because it's connected to the computer which is static which is a very similar this setup that i have is my laptop with my webcam yeah but you have access but anyways and once in a while i connected to my laptop to live lab and that has two cameras the front door and the back camera from the laptop and that's something i was moving around at some point and at the end which wasn't recorded but i think i can also record that if i want or maybe not anyways so that those are the cameras the action camera that's static which could be moved like how are you at in bluestacks there's a webcam that's connected to my desktop and we cannot move by target which can be moved around i think simple simple way to do it also because this is this is the way you're speaking this is this is a this is a research and we have to be realistic that we finish here and then you go and keep on working and the next time we're gonna meet to work will be probably in berlin uh like the real world so um nevertheless i think we should find more than concrete uh settlements or agreements like heart agreements we need to just i think um exercise simplicity i guess so if the idea is like the question is camera so then the simple but the whole thing that i was saying i think at the core is like this ghost camera should move so we should have a third camera like the action camera um i think this works but then then i think there is an ontological uh reason an approach towards the camera it is a static i haven't seen also the image of what is the camera so that's something that we should see yeah um all right i am okay um because yesterday yeah because i was converting videos overnight yeah um then yeah i think i think i have to see it anyway but what i think is that the ghost camera should should be part of the choreography yeah yeah i should have brought the security camera but maybe not i think it's not always good but [Music] from my experience the bird was hovering so not really based on what you said but from my perspective i think i was struggling a lot with cameras and also the technical constraints yesterday yesterday yeah how how i mean what do you mean because i guess i didn't know that yeah i'm struggling i mean not like you know something doesn't work but i'm just trying to figure out what's the best configuration because i think ideally the camera should be moved which camera i don't know which camera but i wanted the camera to move because to use the space that's why that's why at some point i mentioned to you an abroad in theory we can use up to each one at up to seven meters of of uh the cameras the webcams because i have extenders and i have an active extender of the extender so that's why i said at some point if you want because i did it that's that's an element that i draw thinking on that yeah okay um i'm sorry i caught what i would say that's i mean i think this makes me think in the dance again because that's the kind of thing that in dance you can follow and there is it's not so hard say for instance if you start walking and somehow then you propose means of motion or something we don't have to speak to understand somehow there is some intentionality in a follow me or a be affected by this or by me but for instance at that moment when i have the intention to extend the camera i thought it might be an interesting element for you but i cannot i mean i didn't feel with agency to tell you like now do you think might be interesting for you to use this and then and and show you where is it i just basically took mine and tell you is there but there's a lot of things in there you don't know exactly what is there or or you ideally even knew if you pay attention to that because of so that's why i was mentioning the dance again from the conversation yesterday that is the nature of technology it demands that you really pay attention like in a rational way you understand what do you mean uh until you set up you know npm is solved after you install you can start coding but the procedures are just rational there's like these this there is not philosophy around it in dances and abstraction by nature so it gives possibilities for fluidity uh constantly and that's the place that we are like about when when it's about sharing the space and time which is that's the at the core i think dance is an embodied experience that happens on the spa in circling space for a certain amount of time so i couldn't put together what i was thinking the other thing like he wants to be the other thing i was thinking like that i wanted to to share in the chat is that it wasn't regarded any last comment because i thought of that actually yesterday also when i talk with you um but it's difficult how to try to explain this that so say like uh if we understand that in a way what daniella was speaking it was about choreography and understanding of space and seeing the space as a choreographic aspect and the stage design and all these different elements that are about the space and understanding that people come to the space she was not referring about online or she was not referring at any time of these things that we are working with so if we understand that in one hand then because i was i was mentioning to you in a different way these things in the morning or that was my intention then afterwards also i was thinking that yeah but that also means that i i personally that i might don't want to deal with that somehow um or maybe not yet because also that represents something very specific which is come but it is brought by my knowledge let's say of my experience in dance and so it's a it's a it's a tricky thing because in what we do we are challenging constantly basically information in different ways so in that context is knowledge based choreography yeah things are being developed since before us in dance so it was just something that i wanted to share like this is something i have there is not an answer there's this duality that i feel about it yeah but i think what also she was sharing about so basically she said she was working on the piece but also it became like workshop and i don't know how she said it but what i got was like it's also like kind of sandbox because the workshop doesn't have to do with the piece itself i mean what she was saying is like in the workshop doesn't have to have the aesthetics like that she pursues in the piece and maybe also like what i think we could also what you could do is to think about the performance as something like a side of practice i mean it is becoming like that to me at least but i think that was the intentions from when we presented on the impulse and when i when i said this to you is because in my head was clearly that's a performance like after we finished for me was clearly like and therefore then i can apply choreographic thinking on the on the performance and that's why i started putting branches so she called this uh her frameworks she called it i don't remember how she called in her in her own in her ocean but we call it uh branches yeah i think she also used that word i don't know if that's what she uses or use it so she picked it up but so we have this and then from vienna i started putting these hyperlinks to empty dogs on all those are empty documents uh there are branches i think from what we do um yeah i know like i i wouldn't say it was not clear to me i mean or maybe it was not with me but i think i also need to take steps to see what what this process is basically like you can tell me all these things but then i need to you know do the process of like making the performance basically because when you said it probably you already had this intention of making a performance like not doing the prep because for me it's always like there's a practice and then we somehow put it like a performance you know like that's why i always have praying because that's more about the concept that's more about like how we write the description yeah but then i think for you or you already saw that force you have already foreseen that there is this process of making the performance out of the practice but i think that's what i i think in a meta level if you really go out of the scope that's the dual part the dualistic part of what i was saying like not the choreographic aspect but the dual part which is a meta level of the practice as such is is an onto epistemological research between bodies and computers so because of that and because the way we have naturally developed the practice then also i am is not in my intention to impose things but that just thing did not really take the time that they need to take and i feel that we are absolutely the place that we should be i when i invite you to come here i mean star things that in a way are keeping more or less i guess clear or a hill they are right in the moment so i just said okay we should go there and but at the core it still is this softness or this joy of this aiming for pleasure of let's just go and play and practice and all the other things will take place in their own time that i also need first things like that means also to take decisions you know uh um at some point back then we said at some point okay this is nice for us but how when we still we are there and we started talking about this since few months ago how to work toward visibility how to make this that actually as something that people somehow can use also and not only us so therefore if we start speaking about as a performance because it seems to me that it's a clear force or a strategy to um one game is ability second uh subsidized or doing with the practice uh for money and residence and stuff like that then that means that we uh i think the natural thing to do would be to follow uh in one hand could be using that's that's network resources that i guess i i will have i have close to me or media media art resources that you have more than in mind but nevertheless it means that we should go through the process of eventually to have a residence a proper residence same with the space that you have with florida for instance that will be a space that will be interesting for us to develop say the performance that could be a clearing application we want to develop this as a performance yeah i mean it's not against the idea but i also feel that i can see that you know there will be a lot of challenges of course and yeah i think like really the important thing is how we keep how we protect the sandbox so it is but that's why i think like i feel the way we so far the place that we are is still like that after we finished yesterday it's just somebody asked who was it on a part of what of my the way that i'm speaking from what i feel from that a part of how i think was for an external uh present online or live in space and it was easy like the answer was why also for you what you were saying it was fun so it's still fun by the way i checked my live stream and it had almost three hours yeah i checked it afterwards this is weird and actually i checked mine it's really weird so the best practice um so there are two there are two one was in the best practice page like the main so the best practice stage and the other two hours where on the best practice uh hybrid performance okay i didn't edit the the best practice so did he edit it i need to check i i did edit the hybrid one like i first added the best practices and then i think i and i did but what was weird is that because i did not paste my code in the best practice page but i did paste my code in the hybrid page so i didn't understand how my live stream was how did that appear in the in the page i know maybe there was some confusion but because otherwise no one else would why did you have uh two streams like did you change it at one point no i guess that should be just the internet that it dropped i didn't change it that's also weird because even if it drops it will just continue with the same streaming page how i know i understand so what happens is at some point i was struggling with the stream i still don't know already how it works so then i think automatically so i go to a youtube studio i say uh go live and automatically was generating i guess using my code from obs that already was running um but then i wanted to change the title or i wanted to choose my camera i remember and then i just basically i click somewhere else and and i did the process again okay so you made a new screen but then because in the second one i did not i was not using my streaming from obs but i select just the obs camera ah okay like a string from the camera probably not from yeah yeah yeah the streaming key but exactly internal camera the easier way yeah yeah okay yeah i need to check how it was and also how i can alright three videos now yeah because then it's something that i was thinking in the website then we need to have a third in the best in the hybrid page yeah this should be a third camera yeah very layout wise i don't know how i guess should be just like they're like two so the third should be just in the middle and when except my phone is one two three yeah i think so with the i don't know how it works with css grid if it's possible to have like one two and three i think you have to like uh number them in the list i think yeah i mean i'm not css magician or just have a button to say i want one two or two and three play out i'll just randomly show you okay now you have to swatch you have to watch ghost and your sleeve um yes so that's that and you know like most advanced kind of ideas that have like 10 different perspectives right but that would be interesting what would be interesting like what if we motion bang somehow after doing some workshops we kind of do a jam that is hosted on a page that's what the other people would do yeah absolutely i don't know but like we just put like different cameras from different people in that somewhere and we can just create a page for the ccl best practices cl and it's just like a massive pre like a live lab live love for ccl and do something yeah it would be nice to do a gym like that it would be funny like like like kind of live love but if you know like that person can say i won't be you know bigger or smaller what do you mean because life is just like great yeah like instead of like great like you have you know someone has priority you have like a bigger screen like yeah and like not i don't know how it works on them but like if someone can actually claim you know i want bigger screen for the client has the possibility to enlarge that's just for yourself right for the each it's a laptop and then every client they just have they just basically can i think it should not be so complicated if every so we have agreed and don't like it you're talking about the page the page you're going to create let's say yeah say that we create a read for all the clients who people who are participating so every client and they have the possibility basically between large not necessarily their windows but any window that they want it could be you know with a web socket no js like there's like you know button to prioritize yourself like everyone's computer but i think would be nice but it would be nice to like yeah that you have somehow that the people can see like get a message or something happens like that person did that yeah that would yeah actually interesting like that's something like i was like earlier this year i was trying with you know like placement of these windows and stuff which you know doing so much now because it's like quite complex but i think yeah this this is something i want in life like like change the layout for example i cannot do it um yeah i feel so nuts you know a little super nasty this is like that we need more flexibility it's not queer i'm not around the windows anyways i want a triangle window like menu bar and then it was like this that was so cool suggestion for lab lab um yeah i don't know um because i mean it is kind of funny things funny ideas and i think it's also connected to like the workshop ideas and i think that's something we should expand more at the same time you know we should keep technical things really yeah i think something that is quite clear to me is that say the performance it's interesting that we just bring like this is my personality like you know how you get to know me when we travel you can compare your back with my back this is just me like and my the practice but dana was saying that in a way like i think it's i just carry so many things and i'm constantly just searching for things in my life i guess all the time so i think the performance we should have different elements um in the hybrid performance but in the workshop should be the opposite that as the lens that we need are we clarified that would be also easy for i mean just to communicate we can have more elements but technical elements should be maybe hardwood wood like hardware software all these things you know you can have different objects for your practice but you know like bring some props to use to wear but it shouldn't be a technical things it's not really nice i was thinking i was thinking already i thought like i would like to propose than the next um hybrid performance that we start like very early like start like trying to use the heartbeat sensor via bluetooth with a sp 32 because i have this i have this patch that i did with arduino and i think i would like to use it to move because that's a visual that i have from touch designer that i decide from through bdmx and bdmx i use it as a mask so i think i would like to use that mask that is connected to the heartbeat uh i think just that's something concrete but it would be interesting is just because we have to basically make it work and i tried i didn't spend more than a few hours when i had these hoosiers users but they were not easy seems to me they were not easy so i thought something that already i was thinking yesterday maybe next time we should try this p32 yeah because also the problem for instance like a part of the really uh ontological reason apart like a proper research um conceptual yeah like for instance like i know in the research that i did for the for the for the thesis in my school i i knew i know and it's argumented that working with 3d images is just not adding something and it's just making things just more odd so i took the whole process of working with particle systems 3d systems like out of the practice because it was not necessary nevertheless i think in a performance since the performance is not hierarchical if it comes naturally then it should be fine so the problem that i have is that i cannot use notch with with mac and i use just mac but i can use touch designer with mac so the patch that i that i use with for the hardwood sensor is in mac so i can use it i can use that and also what could be interesting is also we can start thinking i would like to try it i will try uh to use because we are the same network so we can do that actually here is to start using uh how you call these things when you send video oh it's protocol that was using like ndi in the eyes yeah so basically then we just put some ndis and then just to go there from both sides um because then we can use the date that no you cannot use it so it's just a video yes no data what could be i mean i think the simple way to start using data could be just a web socket in space and then just this heartbeat sensor it seems to me like a straightforward way to start i mean to test just probably won't work probably it won't work why i don't know because it depends because like also like something i know is that if i really want to make things work i really need to concentrate and that's not really performative you know because i have to block everything i have to call you never though i do the same i was always fine yeah i mean for everyone but then but on the other hand if it's okay it doesn't work but then when you perform it you know it's in a way it's easy because it's you that you are being performing yeah and you know you're responsible for it but also like you know we have anything and it doesn't matter if things work or not you just float into tv [\u00a0__\u00a0] tv yeah i don't know about heart rate sensor if it works or not but i think yeah it would be even just you know finding something simple i don't know if you have any other sensor or buttons or whatever yeah i brought like there are different sensors there we have uh yeah so then i have a bag that it says sensors so the things that i know that i have i have um these things they are for it's like it's a rover then uh how do you call it strange yeah so i have this thing um you can use it also for breathing that's how they interact waiting yeah yeah yeah the easy way so that i have that i have light sensors humidity sensors i have different sensors yeah there's different sensors there's a motor motors i don't know why we're going to use it in the water but there's inflatable and then we just send that multiplayer unity and then we should say like multi and then just something that is moving when it completes yeah so yeah we can do okay i don't know if it's gonna be practice or we just have like work session that's gonna be recorded or whatever no i think that would be i mean i think this would be part of the hybrid performance but i think what we have to understand is like there is a moment that just let it go that's what it happened yesterday you know like i have the intention of the theory the word so then you move on but then you are not i think that's the i think that's the performance that's that's like i think that the performance or the space is just it's about embodying what happens so there is a clear intention to work let's say with the heartbeat sensor we try if it's not working then what happened with you you know what happened with me like what does that mean or what it why what if it works i was just thinking that's what you want to measure with heart rate sensor like you're like your heart like posterior [Music] to measure like your level of stress and then putting side to side like somewhere something that i also thought it could be useful for the projection for is that there is another projector to that so that we can just put two projectors and then just we set them up as we want and then just we have two projectors and then just we put as they much as we feel they should be so i think all the easiest way basically to solve the uh your screen yes and no like i'm just thinking about what could what can we do with projector because i think it's also it could be movable the projector you know i mean you can't really move it around but like change the surface for life something that i would like to do because i was doing that at the beginning of the research is the using projectors at light sources so that's why i brought the smoke machine so that could be something that i all feel interested like to uh generate lights from the projectors so i think rather than like a sign this is your projector this is my projector it's static in this position i think we could use two projectors with two long hashtag means i think we just so it's just nothing it's not hierarchical because we just use them right now we can remove them i didn't know that you're moving them but now i'm thinking that i would like to work with life so and my dmx control will arrive today if possible if area wanted to meet boyan which is uh brianna mike she was arriving and it will be interesting to see if she sees this i don't know so you know this like you know parts no this is cool so brianna is in a way like the person who is in charge of their parts or the research part okay so somebody who in dance field is when she has been written books about choreographic research is quite a important let's say she writes a lot about dance for quite some time i'm curious if she will oh maybe that's give me a space to talk about the sharing i'd like to say so the way who we did it like the way we share it with people is the way home normally we do it or the way i was doing it before it was no different i was not trying to make something more or less it was that i did before when we did the residence uh but now it was not here um it's basically at some point we define the time then i just go there and basically i love the hashtag i still i have problems while you don't use the the hashtag that you apply or when you write sometimes you put capital best practices to make clear that is that but this is i'm okay also because you have agency to write as you want but then i like to do that in purpose to confuse i mean i like it anyway so i just put this hijacked and in letters that were not so big it is there best practice in containing colorado dance and then hashtag hybrid performance live from big studio five eight online on this qr code and i put it there five minutes before we start it will say that we will be there for three hours so it's not something that oh damn it's just 20 minutes i miss it you can pass by and watch it if you want i also took the time to you to do the social media exactly as we do with you i started performance as part of the performance because i i like to take care of the social media then i just do the process of like instagram facebook tagging all these things checking double checking is going to the right links and stuff like that um so when daniella was like asking the views like did you put it in the in the board and also she was saying like i think she was a bit surprised in a way that i didn't share it because without my interpretation because in paths let's say when you want to share something because the space it gives you really the possibility to have good concrete feedback and maybe possibility to get paid by your work like like to just have new network opportunities visibility basically um then people uh they announced it in the dinners or something like this and for instance like in the same spirit of like i'm gonna place a uh movie in the space so but then that this is my personal uh in the way so far i have been interacting with bob is that i think in what we're doing because it seems to me that it works actually for us like vanilla foreign for a long time that she was very excited in the way she was going on this and this and this and this and this um better completely got it like in two sentences she was like she was saying like this is this and it was more or less what we're doing and then we have this when i was in linz in a way i think also the proposition of the phd i think is in part because i have this research with best practices so in my school also the people didn't completely understand but they gave me 19 points out of 20. so these things for me in my head are the confirmation that i got when i understood earlier in the process that what we were doing was something special something unique and i understood that so i guess part of uh i'm saying that because of if i'm sharing what we do in certain way so far i guess it's because maybe i'm not in uh so far maybe it's not my intention to really share it also um also his name is because i don't feel like basically because i don't feel like everybody looked at me like basically just sharing a big thing yeah but also i think has to be much my personal thing that i'm not so good and doing that because if i do it and i will do it and it should become something that is part of my personalities which is what i do as we work you know like this as being social being this it comes from a very specific part of myself that i understand now what is it then what i mean for instance i try to be the close to myself so i don't want to deal with that because it gives me a lot of conflict that i don't understand um so but i guess like it would be interesting that uh it's just it's basically that it's a thing about being vulnerable and invite people to basically tell you things or giving constructive criticism uh or just like your feedback in what you do so then you put yourself in the space of so you're sharing something and and everybody's the process is different so because of that also i have done i have shared what i do here in that way i remember the first time when i shared but the first thing i did was like from the this solo that i told you they started with the evil in the impulse dance then [Music] but remember that i i create uh time slots so i just create a uh i print a4 and i create time slots no actually work on time slots i just thought i don't want more than 15 people inside at all um and then i actually then i went to martin and i asked him it was my first time here for some reason i went to ask him and he said yeah whatever and he's in his mouth was on her way like yo whatever you do what you want so then i did it and that was my first time working here and i also i remember the first interaction that i have with john he was saying when i show my solo i think i share that experience with you that he didn't like it because i was not sharing anything he said like you need to share it and mark and also what's in that idea this has to change because you need to share it uh from that was from their perspective and in my feedback from what i did in the evo which was very very different building chef has a completely different approach to marketing spammer to choreography and broadcasting um so that's to say that sharing and liking those this this is like sharing about my experience in puff and sharing my things then uh i do i don't know i'm not i don't feel i don't know i guess in that sense please become a big person maybe i should just try to cut it and go away from that um it's not so easy for me to do it you know in a soft way i need my space like as you do you need your space so that's why i think we work i was trying to express that some days ago like i think that's what we can work well because i have my moments i'm constantly during the day i'm up and down up and down up and down so i mean people often are very happy or they're very social it takes a lot of energy from them i think to me i don't want to kind of wrap up what you said but we need to find like every single thing what we do about posting online or telling other people or this thing that looks so trivial but we are questioning i think that's good and we have to come back to this idea like just to question like not to follow something that should be done this way we should talk to everyone about what we do but not like that but you know if we don't feel doing so it's good and also you know you can talk in the chat why we don't announce it i mean we do announcement we do but we do it in a different way and then that's we need a bot it's a lot of work we need a bot we need the bot who is doing all these things you know efficiently i think that's part of that i think that that eventually could be part of a branch like and there was this guy how is the name of the guy american artist this guy was amazing because basically hijacked the co the search engine of the seo the search engine optimization and because he at some point decided to call himself american artist then the first heat that now you will find in google is him next to great american uh nervously the first one who you can find there and that's uh very interesting because i think i will feel more interested in that's more hacker you know that's more like it's going more to the hacking community like to really uh hack the the media to pollute the the internet with traces with hashtags but that that means that that's a research in itself you know that's that's one thing i don't know completely how that works i just do what i think is good and i have a system that i repeat over and over and over so it could be optimized for sure but then who's gonna pay me for that to invest that time yeah i mean maybe that's the conflict i have with hashtag uh best practices contemporaries that i don't like actually i put it on my youtube video it's not as title but in the description so you can it's actually searchable uh but i don't really use its titles because i think um well to me it's just too long but also i think if you think about like search engines and stuff if that's the title i think that's not like like pollution wise if you split the worst that's more effective yes that could be caught as you know best practices and contemporaries but if it's like one word i think it will be like treated as one word but then it's unique if somebody produced okay okay actually of course i'm not saying which is good or bad of course that you know catches your eyes and then it's so strong but also if you think of a search engine specifically then but we could use both you know we can go back and forth and i think that's that's good also yeah yeah i don't know how how this year works yeah i mean i'm just like so obsessed like this eagle search like searching my name or searching the project name and see what's going to show up and then you know i'm really happy that if you search this practice you're going to pronounce it our project shows up at the top which is you know it's quite something it's not easy yesterday this question of this is atlanta my pop the dinner and she asked when i saw her the page and then she said like why in contemporary dance and then i said like i don't know and that was i think enough i mean she has a website there you can when i show her like hyperlink you know if you go here and then you go there there there and then i mean we were doing that for three hours and then just came down and then again we briefly said to to him what was about and then again and then she was asking that so it's not about his fault but it's just as humanly just i don't want to think of this anymore please and i absolutely asked at some point like do you are you searching for a collaborator do you remember she asked when we were there sitting and after before we went outside to smoke and she was she asked ah are you searching for a collaborator yeah and now i mean i was like i guess i don't want that right now i mean it's just complicated so then then i didn't want to say to her no i don't know i mean i just left i said i'm going smoke i didn't want to answer that it's something completely irrelevant i just so i we have this at the school we have this mailing list which is not official official but it's like more from the student association so anyone can subscribe and you know some random people also write and then i got this email from the mailing list that this person is doing some film and she wants to have a animation of like star field you know like tunnel of stars in space okay and she wants it to be realistic and then i was like thinking about it like i think realistically speaking you won't see the tunnel of stars if you even if you travel super fast in space it becomes a line doesn't it no i don't think so because that's when like if you have like particles around you and if you're going super fast then you will see this you know trace yeah like they're actually moving it's like a twirl becomes a twirl yeah but the stars are like so far that probably like they're like moving super slow and like i don't think it's going to be like it is realistic like so that's realistic is the word that i found is interesting is i think it's in a sense of like sci-fi realistic but not you know like a children drawing kind of thing she wants but something that fits in the context of sci-fi but like if you think about it scientifically she don't she don't want to do it realistically basically yeah if it's realistic i feel it's going to be just like you know a little bit boring she don't want i think he's so boring like it's so it started so far that it will not move that fast i think yeah willie will know about it that's her whole project but the project of uli is really conceit is her project as an artist because she's an astrophysics and an artist she's not that she's not an art scientist that's another career that was in the previous chat it's something different that we have spoken about that yeah anyway uh she's an artist and a scientist to study both careers so as an astrophysics as an artist you use uh your knowledge and astrophysics to create graphics which is based on cheap because of the work of an of uh somebody who observed the stars is basically the trace and make graphs from the movement that's the way how they they research and they get together and gather data that you know about the position and how far away they are and possibly galaxies and stuff like that so then she's following that and she do graphic prints of that i think in a way it's like long exposure so she will know exactly how it looks like that might be wrong but i don't think there's like not a video that shows the tunnel of stars it's a distorted like i mean it's not really that everybody has to start at the same time but i think normally one but then also then this is for people if you want to come back and someday we have a gaming performance that means that uh you dressed up in a way and then you perform okay and we then all the places in the house are greeting the board and basically then you cross the area tomorrow that you want to clean and then as much as you want i guess if you do at least two three that's like you have to more or less like see how many people are in the house but two three is good and you can do more awesome and and then once so then you cross it and then you do it and that's it normally also before when i was here in february it's like normally the time that out after when we finish then you put time slots to use the salmon there's somebody would write their sauna it's called sun sunday sunday sunday it's called sound day and then there are some time slots and then you put it half an hour you mean okay i think maybe it's good rubble here yep thank you for watching and what's coming next we don't know we don't know what like i think we would like to try the data use data so meaning that this answer sensor and sp 32 sounds like fun yeah we might end up just throwing bsp32 with each other yes yes yes all right thanks for watching subscribe like", "-KNzui9uN6c": "all right now we can speak now we can talk about everything anything you want so basically i was saying no to that there is a point because now you're in the same spot same place and this really feels like a residence because we have a space for everything so yeah we wanted to speak to share what we were doing but at the same time then we said like no wait wait wait wait wait like right after we finished yeah so what happened you think that we're always on this youtube but it's not true we have our lives it's like a tv star you know like you're always on tv but you have your private life of course so there's backstage like real backstage that we finish we have a nice lunch so but what happened but what did we did what did we do um we did a practice for two hours from five to seven and this was the third time we did together in the same place this is the third third time that we're going together yeah in real life first time at puff and in the second time do we have a proper like a big space right first one was a bit too ghetto but actually this time it was the configuration was similar to the first one yeah yeah we did at node thank you yeah basically we have separation yeah it was perfect this thing there we can hang the green key but i still i'm wearing maybe maybe just my head will be floating in the video is that chroma don't forget hugh because it somehow didn't work okay and yeah so yeah so we didn't i mean we were like walking around sometimes but basically the idea is that we have our own space we're not like doing like side by side which at ist it was a bit like and it was whatever man whatever we had a table we had this yeah yeah that's that's that's true we have a desk but in like dog d was whatever yeah and we were projecting also which i think is useful the projection today it was good because then i could because also the projection was on my side yeah like i could just like see it and i was projecting my screen no okay so usually i have to go back to live vlog to see what we're doing but i don't have to do that like i can just open whatever full screen that i'm working on and then take a look at it because also like i never really use like second screen although if i really want i can set it up like i can set up my laptop as a second screen but i don't usually do it i never do it so i don't have like a monitor for live lab which would be so useful to have obs and live lab yeah what i did was like i have my laptop and then i mirror my laptop into the projector and then at some point when i start so i start working just with live lab and hydra at some point i start working with the bdmx and then i connect the secondary screen and then then i have it just to see the output of the dmx yeah yeah yeah and i don't know about most of the the part except the end we well i was dancing and we have some we had colors well because i noticed that you started doing audio reactive kind of yeah and also the hue i was changing the view within the lfos yeah so i was like okay i'm gonna do that same and because of some technical difficulties it didn't work as i expected but because i had to do some kind of weird routing of the sound and there was a huge delay but it kind of worked yeah like like the images that we have like from the last half an hour were really good they were very interesting but at the same time make me think because i don't know i i wanted to share this with you then i thought this looks good and then i thought um how to say that because for instance like the way why how i create effects i can do very fast like things that you have to code then i was thinking what i was doing this like wow we should talk because in a way almost i was thinking as a setup uh where we use the code when we need it but then from the effects or something like this then we just go with bdmx which is a software for vgen but then at the same time that i was having this thought then i thought wow but this is really like going for uh functionality i'm making something good and they make me i don't know i wanted to share this with you because i don't know how to feel about it i see yeah yeah i can relate i can understand i mean i think to be honest like i think as a gig you know if you want to be hired for to perform and show something that in a way people like then i think make sense in a way like to work in that way you know like support from our skills and but as a research as the ontological research that is the best practices in contemporary dance i think we should be careful with that also and make sure that we don't go to the comfort i see because in a way i mean following that idea i could i can imagine if that as one of the other branches that we can set is like could be gig like a gig not even a hybrid performance but just a gig you know where we really try to perform kind of like an audio visual show as a duo as a duet but you mean like working with other people or just like without a dj for example for instance like with music yeah as a live set yeah like uh audio visual like another visual performance yeah i would say i think then you should do it alone like i don't really because i'm not really interested in it anymore as a gig that's the thing yeah that i mean i can do it like as you said if we you know try to figure out what i do with the code what you do with the vmx and it's also you know you can mix videos with the video capture and stuff like it's all possible but then do i want to do it um well maybe it's interesting to it like like once but i don't think that's something like i don't think that's my passion no i mean i i feel like this is the way i feel also but what if as i said before i think could be something that could be a branch you know then we know like okay now what we're doing is the gig but indeed like i'm more interested in in the entological process that we have we are trying to do yeah so in that sense i i agree with you but i think because i didn't want to say like i really don't want to do it because i can also see that something something interesting will hap interesting will happen during the process but it doesn't have to be a gig i mean that's the thing of the the difference between like how i see the hybrid performance which is an ontological research life with people the other thing is the gig that is in a way like just we put it aside let's say um yeah it's also like that it has to like constantly something has to happen and it doesn't have to be there's no dramaturgy for example i mean there is kind of but it's not that yeah yeah yeah see what i mean it cannot be a composition like like a set piece that we present over and over and over i mean that could be i mean like if we start to think about that direction it's gonna be like an installation i think that we use the video material instead of it performing if we think about composition hello anyway i think i mean let's leave this thing aside uh i think also what happened is this is the first time we do a practice in like one month like the last time was in the impulse dance end of july so almost two months yeah so i think it was great like to be in the same space and now i was trying to use the kinect that didn't work like during practice i was installing the driver actually and it didn't work yeah but also like because i i saw it like you know because we did the development before like one day format so i was like yeah like i can think this because i have two hours so like just say like 30 minutes or even like one hour of you know development within the practice that's also okay so i was trying to run it i even downloaded open frameworks add-on made by eliot actually yeah yeah okay um thank you elliot he came here could i use it that was yeah but that was because of the kinect that was not uh even with the official 3d view where it didn't work uh yeah what else for me the setup was a little bit inconvenient because i don't have a proper display so like proper monitor for the computer because i this time i brought the proper computer but maybe what you could do i mean is there is this screen that i told you but it's just 720 so it's very easy it's a very small screen but that's the screen that you could use from here yeah maybe i can use it as a secondary screen because if i use a video capture and so what i was doing is i use a video capture and then show it on my laptop and that goes 1080p i think and that was like okay it's not great but i could do it anyways i was recording the whole thing with at 1080p so with obs so it doesn't really matter in the end are you recording 1080 yeah i recorded 720 always but um yeah i mean that's just the technical things but like to be honest like things that i found that were interesting was like it's difficult i mean because we were like we were in in the same space with tools so we were testing things so it's difficult to actually give the time for yourself to just stop basically and just look around you know to really to embody the space and what is going on so sometimes we would have the the when i give the space then things were interesting then it was there were things happening and then sometimes like when you pass through my screen or when i mean what once the this invisible which is real in a line the border between you and my setups uh are crossed so when you pass my screen or when i pass your screen i think more than how cool was the image or not i think as those moments are interesting because we acknowledge that we are in the space and actually because we use like with a chroma key but the space is the same so at one point i was like looking at the image and looking at part of the image and i was like is this my view or yours because the background is kind of the same yeah and that becomes really interesting also like when i was walking around i could see myself small but is it my view or your view like right yeah that was quite that was quite interesting i think yeah yeah i think space i think in general what i feel that could be more to explore is the space like the mobility of the space at some point you start moving with your laptop and that was nice then i was following you at some point also i think that was i didn't check the image but just the feeling that feels very like natural it felt like um very performative in a way like how you will react in a dance environment being affected by other bodies in the same space so yeah i think the connection was a bit choppy during that uh i don't think that my laptop was like very slow i don't know why but live live was looks really slow maybe because it's the third person in the live lab so it kind of slows down what i want to say is i like what i like about today's configuration is we were kind of separate we had a separation but in the same space and at infrastance we were in the same space and there was like we were sharing space yeah and i don't i wouldn't say which is better but this was interesting i mean to think about these two possibilities yeah yeah indeed because yeah to be honest yeah that's the feeling that i got from this one this time this this is this is way too strong like to have this in the middle that's the way i feel like if i compare with the impulse then maybe it felt more organic because there is not a separation i see so in this one it feels really like you're trying to create a i think it's yeah i think it has to be with realities in a way like in the sense of we are trying to portray or to separate to realities but it's not strong enough as an object in the space you know what you could see online it's is okay because it works but as a life as a hybrid performance so for the person who are there is a bit silly because it's not really said it's the physical thing that is i think what i'm trying to say is like if we're gonna do something like that the object that we are using it must respond to something it cannot just be something like a square hanging it's just it felt just very fake or very artificial let's say okay so it felt like we need this because we need to hang the green key yeah i see yeah it was really ad hoc makeshift but it could be also part of the stage design i don't know what is choreography and stage design but for example like we could move it i was thinking that i was thinking first imagine that we have something that is mobile so that it has wheels that will make a huge difference because then we can just move it around also these things can be tilt if you just move it so just like using the thing as an object in the space so as another element not just something that is an artifact that it has no purpose more than just separate reality right yeah yeah yeah for because yeah because i think the offs what is off from there is like we use something that actually separates reality which makes sense online but life makes no sense because it's not really doing something it's not really separating reality you see what i mean like online makes sense because these things separate you and me basically the green key the green key okay uh because otherwise you we will see each other so in a way like gives actually a clear campus for you to play and for me to play actually at the same time but in in in life uh okay like online i mean like online viewer yeah the online viewer if somebody's watching first somehow like two the two things at the same time they can really experience uh the two realities but in the space is an object that is is we know what it's doing but other people won't want to understand what is it and it's just something that is there and it's off true it's very uh it's an artifact very fake i don't think is the word but yeah something like that artificial yeah artificial yes yeah yeah it's true i didn't think so much but for example this was probably really not interesting if you watch in real life like if you watch it online probably it's interesting yeah or certain yeah something yeah certainly yeah yeah they're moments yeah the last part is good and but there was something if if i compare with the the impulse dance there was something that was completely off um true also we both were chill no i mean those there's no public so we are just chill testing things and there was no pressure but it was not so interesting for me if i compare in regards to in and really comparing with the impulse i mean it was different i mean we did it as if we are in a different different spaces but that's what i mean with the realities you know that sometimes like and that's so sometimes we cross these realities a tiny bit when you have when i ask you and those moments are interesting but i'm asking you now how can i do this and then you come and you break that reality that moment is interesting nothing happens there it doesn't mean that we have to start acting you know but just to have the at least to acknowledge these moments yes it's a thing with reality i mean i make a lot of i think in my i'm thinking that it gives me this uh feeling of virtual reality somehow now this like is yeah something that is is about realities it was almost like what we did and if you watch there it's like behind the scenes like if you watch this as a hybrid performance in the same space yes then for the audience it's like behind scenes because yeah the thing is not happening there in a way it's true yeah but it's true yeah yeah yeah you're right yeah also for using the way who i was doing the last but the last part when i i found interesting things of what you were doing and i i i set my i found some feedback and then it was like uh coming from the center out and then i could i found a way how to use the x and y axis so then i was basically djing with the music and that was interesting but as you said i guess online would be interesting but for offline i'm just bj yeah yeah exactly yeah what could be interesting maybe sorry what could be interesting is that uh so i brought with me uh a midi controller that is uh wireless this that i'll be using today is not wireless so i brought one wireless but i need to set it up uh in a way the way the way how it works so far is every time i'm not using or something it will go out of the bluetooth so i have to do the process again to connecting the thing so it's something in the setting and the setup i need to install the right drive or something i need just to to do it but then i will have something for instance it will be the same situation where we found something interesting like you were doing some motion and it's repetitive and it works with the image that i'm creating right uh and also with your image then i can embody it when i'm beating saying through movement somehow but then i need to be free so i could do that uh if i have this wireless thing no actually what i would say is almost the same thing but i mean i mean the same direction that then the reason why people use sensors is that right like to like heart rate or whatever like maybe heart rate is not that interesting but let's say connect and then attract movement and attach that to visuals for example like some of the parameters it's very simple but then you can be performative instead of using midi controller and you can be performative and then something also happens image yeah i'm not saying that we should do it that way but that makes sense that like why people do that but i think the reason why i'm not so interested is mostly if you do that uh everything is kind of set like you cannot you have to kind of stick to the kind of pre made but i mean but that's what we do know i mean this is we have a contradiction like what we do like it because basically what we do or what i do is then i i play or i develop until i find something that is interesting for what we do and then i will play and then i stay there so then i leave my computer and then i will start move right and then i will do the process over and over and over again so in that sense this idea of the kinect it responds to the same thing if if we have the uh sensibility of understanding enough is enough and then just you move on and you start doing something else but i think it's because of the nature of what we do is with the computer and as you were saying this this is i mean it works or it doesn't work i mean there is not there is not an abstraction of that either this code will run or the technology will be on or off that's it so unfortunately unfortunately even if we work with hydra even if we do performance yeah but the other thing that i mean does the thing that i i don't know i think this is part of the same idea of the post-humanism like or trying to imagine what is not possible to imagine um so try to leave your body to imagine something that is not possible to imagine within within this body because there is the impossibility let's say bringing it to what we are speaking like the technology because it's on or off nevertheless uh i think insisting in trying to embody that process is what you're doing so i think insisting in the process of basically being being in the flow and how it doesn't have to be so rigid on i setting up i dance i stop i go back i set up i go a dance and and again and again because at the end that's what it happens but um i guess if if we are in the flow we spoke of that like very early in these chats i think this the passing by these two states of computer and dance uh are should be more uh soft and like the edges yeah no this is something i think after the practice like because during the practice i don't think really about what i'm doing right now it's more about okay i'm dancing i'm i got bored with what i'm seeing i change the code and then like changing the code i'm lazy so i wouldn't spend so much time although you know there's like always rabbit hole try to debug something doesn't work something doesn't work but then you know that's the moment i'm like okay whatever i'm dancing again i think i'm really getting good at switching back and forth um but that's something like comes not naturally but i think i get the flow at this point but then after the practice i can really think backward uh like think about the practice okay yeah this this moment i was coding but it's really alien sorry yes go ahead yeah it's it seems really alien like because there's no like rational decision why i stop dancing why i stopped coding started dancing again no i mean this is in it goes in uh on the direction of like being sensible of what you're doing or what you're doing of what is happening so i still think that i speak from my side like i can be more try to be more sensible trying to stop more often to embody what is happening in the whole space now that we have a space and but yeah so this is uh about that but i was thinking that we should do we should watch while we but it happens and we should record it like we should do that exercise tonight if you're up to that we should watch what the recordings okay what we did yeah and then just we put it in the media space that we have a big screen and then just we basically we put we record somehow and that comment comment basically we said that we wanted to do that always so we can do it now here yeah that will be interesting yeah and then we can see what each other is doing during yeah yeah that's that's and actually if it's necessary then like personally stop i think it will be a really good exercise like a stop like wait wait wait i mean i guess during the performance during the the watching we can just comment but at some point if there is for there is the need to understand something then we just pause pause the video and then we just talk a little bit about it yeah it sounds like we need like 12 hours i was thinking that it's already two hours it's already two hours afterwards what we could do is like i did it one time i told you like when i was here i put sides side to side the the both uh videos and then so i think that could work it's just we put it side side side and then it's just two hours instead of watching two hours and then two hours yeah for sure like because then you can see the connection yeah yeah yeah yeah what is i mean what what what i'm foreseeing is that if we put this video side to side i don't know what how happened with you but when i put in this you and me side side i will be watching myself more than when i'm watching you because in a way i'm trying to i don't know i guess like trying to find where did i screw it up basically you know this kind of like we're like oh my god this was terrible um so i'm curious to to do it with you maybe your present will make the thing more light and then i don't have to be completely on myself we'll see but yeah we should do the narration but then for that we need to upload the videos yes so that's something that we have to do because the internet impact is unbelievable man and now it's good yeah yeah i told you like i think three years ago or two years ago i think it took me yeah i couldn't send like i think it was less than 10 megabytes an email i couldn't send it it was impossible it was that bad yeah maybe pigeons were sending the data to paris horrible to the center anyways but maybe we can deal with that um let's talk about it uh in the backstage yeah off the record but let's let's close here and then yes and then we see you i guess this is super cool we are doing this is the second chat of the day yeah so we did two chats one practice one wow this is so we're on fire on fire yes so so much work done man yeah i'm puffing like that you keep saying 140 whatever hours but now we already have you know like maybe plus five hours of content since you said it we should yeah we have to calculate it again as a calculator we should have a website where it shows with the encounter with the camera yeah we have the account this much amount this much hours of uh there should be a way how we can calculate this no could be tricky now because then you have to okay we go back we go backstage this is like this is nerdy stuff okay so please like the video subscribe thank you everyone subscribing these days and uh what else and uh looking forward for the next one", "97sctZ7WXO0": "hello hey so it's the second day is it yes second day the hot puff yes and i'm stressed with the noise at the back i hope it's not really not it's not really loud in the recording but we will see yeah i mean at one point i thought you know i mean it's the act of recording and it's it doesn't have to be archival it can it can't be worse than the sound uh new now it can be worse than the sound that we know why oh yeah because the sound was coming from really far away i mean i mean the sound that we have yeah the example is just like because it can be worse than that yeah the acoustic in the space was really bad um like i recorded the same camera and i watched it again a bit but is constantly like really loud noise but of course the streaming we had microphones so i'm looking forward to watching the recording because it should have nice documentation yeah and two weeks will be available online please check that out so what up not nauto we did we didn't saw each other from yesterday at some point just each one and start doing all their own stuff and right how was how has been your time here so far yeah i mean again when we came back when we have when i had to leave i was really stressed out because of the other project meeting which actually took a whole two hours but then after that uh it wasn't it was still not dinner so everything was fine this morning i was a bit slow i was reading a bit here and then i went up a little bit walking around oh yeah where did you went to work uh just going up and uh see the cross and then after that i wasn't sure if this is someone's property or not so i was like you know uh but also like you know at one point there's some fences but i'm not sure if i'm inside defense or outside friends like is it like i did i like went somewhere wrong that i went inside someone's property already or if i'm just looking at someone's body but i think it's not so clear like also maybe it's for adding more for the animals yeah anyways yeah but you didn't cross nobodies no i know i know where you went if you go if you keep on walking in that direction there is something that is called uh i don't remember exactly the name but it's a settlement a celtic settlement yeah because in this area the highest point that you have around the area and the celtics used to stay there from there they could see when other people were coming from all over the place these are is called v-brakes and there's a nice recording there rafael baloney a friend of mine uh they record an album called [Music] should we just pretend that we don't hear anything and we continue i guess let's see so we have to work on some papers but except besides that what are we gonna do or i mean i started already moving the equipment that we brought to into the big space i still have your connection ah you have one kidney now yeah the rest is there so just in our own time because we go there at some point in that big space big space i think i think it's perfect because there is this board i was thinking that we should do a practice today actually okay we'll do a practice with like two hours and then listen to space and it's nice because there is this board but we can hang the drinky i am true true we can kind of can we could do like as we didn't know yeah asa homage one year no set up and i forgot the green key oh yeah but i think it's long enough to be yeah almost on both sides long length no because uh during node i brought it but i forgot to hang it because we are so stressed whether you are using this there was a white background with the spikes they were very nice texture yeah they were getting a nice texture there also we have to cook i don't know if you're up to that also i can show you what i brought yeah we can do that behind the scenes what else did you have a nice conversation yesterday with people in yeah actually that's something what i wanted to talk about maybe or at least share is that um wait i need to look my note i don't want to make it wrong but i was talking with uh honey writer from holland no um he's based in new york with um ah okay so he's the guy with the yeah yeah yeah i think it's egyptian that he's based in new york and he's like basically visiting here for like a week or so and it's the first time i think so yeah yeah yeah briefly i've met him yeah yeah oh yeah so basically i explained what the practice is and and also i talked with about the the thing from yesterday morning that we talked about queer development yes because he was saying like he has no idea about coding he doesn't do you use computer for sure to you know to write but that's the only thing he does so then i started explaining why coding is so hard like hard in a way that it's not like difficult to learn but it doesn't basically allow failure it's really rigid it has to be productive it has to be done in a very specific way so you can you know easily get discouraged if you you know you cannot get something then it's very very hard to follow that's why like we talk about queer development that allows different things to happen i guess give agency to the coding practice but then what he said is okay so you can fail with coding but then what he said was like for example what happens if that code is running the airplane then it crashes and uh everyone's gonna die uh yeah i think that's not hitler no no but i think it's really interesting because also what he said is if so that's when what happens let's say if you're a bad programmer but then what if if you're a bad performer it's not going to kill anyone you know i mean if you perform something really bad people won't appreciate it i don't know what it's bad good bad but they say people didn't appreciate it but still no one gets hurt or mentally something can happen but you know they're not physically injured right i think that's really interesting analogy because what we do is let's say a performance so we make a sandbox that we always talk about so we can fail with the programming but it's not going to hurt anyone and that allows also for the workshop idea that because we make a sandbox it's a performance so we can fail while using code or technology and still it's safe that's my takeaway from the conversation yeah yeah i think i don't feel qualified to program an airplane yet i have to say queer airlines i don't i'm not there yet that's why what i found like so i felt so pressured when i get this uh when daniel expressed the invitation like to do this phd in liens because it basically was like to work with robots it was embodied machine i think was is the framework and then i just thought like oh my god you know before i start working i just thought like because i guess they offered the robotic laboratory lab and of course with people who have uh good uh technical skills for that computer science engineering exactly nevertheless it means that i have to work with that and i was already before starting like to uh to get the stress and then i checked this course in the mit or robotics essentials but actually it was called full stack robotics okay yeah yeah because like besides all this academic stuff you well i don't know you can fail or not with the robots i mean i think like it will be a part of the research now so i guess we'll be constantly that would be interesting i mean i guess that's part of the research because it's called embodied machine know so it's like then how uh through my experience uh in my doing with technology i then i can translate that into specifically robotics the embodiment part that i have developed what i was just thinking because i think let's say like it's industrial industrial robots and you can code but i think there are two layers one is that something you can experiment and you can fail in a way with i don't know it's movement or something but there's another layer that has to prevent something completely wrong to happen like let's say crash into someone or yeah yeah or explode this has to be prevented but that's the idea of sandbox right yeah yeah yeah because you have to have like in the sandbox like computer science like software you have access to you don't have access to everything like you cannot hijack the host computer the whole computer to you know do something wrong so that's why like you make a sandbox and you can run like computer virus for example to test what's going to happen inside but that's not going to contaminate outside with its inside sandbox so you have to but then you have to design the sandbox when you work with robots so that you're safe inside the sandbox you're not gonna harm anyone but then you still have enough control so that you don't feel like okay the only thing you can do is to move the arm like this way to this way like that's well maybe you can do something interesting with it but i think what you want with the sandbox is that you still have a freedom to move it around but then it doesn't exceed certain speed for example so that it won't you know bump into something yeah that's why like when i was like thinking about this project like that i actually i have to say that i haven't read the official uh application of the project uh within the johannes kepler university which is like just a long academic thing that danila sent me and then i just i was thinking that because i was i was just trying to put it in the context of best practices and the technology of who i'm used to work and then i just i was thinking that i right away i didn't feel myself or like imagining a body next to the robot because exactly what you're saying so and in that sense if the robot is somehow there trying to be embodied somehow then it means nevertheless then it should be in full control somehow the robot will be within constraints of the sandbox and i cannot imagine like being myself next to the robot i guess ideally at some point i would like to put myself next to the robot and then dance or do something let's say do a practice with a robot but then until i get to that point it seems quite far away from from my own vulnerability as human yet then you really need to go like in a scientific research like you know like to test test test test like to do many many retests until you have something that is like you think it's safe and then you actually you give the other pairs or you really test it until you can have a better version and then try it slowly to put some teddy bear maybe first or some money first next to it and see if the monarchy is not being killed you know what reminds me is the like a safety like testing from the cars you were talking like yo yeah basically they put like mannequins and you know crash the car into a wall and see if they're not injured actually like recently i went to like a museum the mercedes benz museum and they showed like kind of a bit of history like because the whole thing is about their cars but also they showed a bit of research and they started like with mannequin you know like like real like how to say real mannequin like mannequin made for you know more like fashion design and stuff like that right and then because they are aware that the safety becomes like like really crucial thing for them for the development so they started with mannequin and then they started to say that okay like we have to build our own mannequin to to be you know tested for this specific purpose um i think that's interesting i mean i don't remember much but this is interesting yeah like the because then basically this mannequin is like an instance of a human if you want to see it somehow that's interesting to try to develop some dummy body that is uh an instance of a to human test that the practice is safe enough i'm just imagining like what if this practice we do is actually not safe like it's it's safe what we do like not safe also like you know toxic it's a safe toxic kind of sense but like really like you know something that you can get injured with something mechanical or something yeah so that we we have this lab for best practices in the situation and there's like one department testing the safety of practice this mannequin and then the head is chopped off and oh sorry like this practice not safe no it's not for the deployment oh my god and it would be funny then just you have like really a pipeline and then you are ready to go there no you cannot because we test and the money kills exactly and then we're so pissed off you know like this was uh you know we have to do this for a performance like next week you know what can we do like that was part of the scene imagine imagining what we're doing the practice somebody started like running or doing this from behind camera like you have to stop it's not safe um you're like what i'm busy no no no a way and one of us gets killed and unknown then the government has to really work on you know this like okay you have to be the license for the practice and you have to get like tested the space is safe enough you need to go to the stage like show me your license [Laughter] best practice license it's a good possible body high higher institute of best practices in contemporary lands of course you have to learn the theory and the practice to get license yes that's what that's all this is very interesting like danila for instance daniela then she has her research is very much about like she was telling me like she works a lot with embodied in different ways no um and caring she's a good take a caretaker she takes care of people and she was mentioning that she's running a project now there is the i think it has five pillars and one is it was it was it's around the idea of labor but then you touch feminism racism yeah different pillars but it's very is very uh i guess she's very advanced in this in in these topics because she has been researching on this like for i know concretely that she started with a project that now is called ocean but it started as a uh as a proposal where in the big studio people or in the chair and the chapel you go and bring your mattress and some blankets and then basically just you lay down and she takes care of you like she put some sound and maybe some essence smells and stuff like that and it's a durational performance so i will go for five hours or more so that was like i think that was maybe like two years ago three years ago when she started with that and now she's in ocean with now's uh i guess now she's trying to push different things around that and then start working with the idea of labor and invisible labor labor is a constantly impact because there's a lot of invisible labor so then yesterday we were joking because so we were saying that path we said that we are doing a phd in housekeeping or house yeah yeah yeah somehow because it's a constant thing every time yeah how enabled body is how to like what is the um what does it mean is a idea of like police agent what does it mean like different different uh agents in the space what are the roles uh the newcomer the long stayer like the all of them and it's yeah it's very interesting i know it's a joke but this phd thing i'm starting think like i could do phd if i can frame what i want to do i think there are two kinds of phds but one is like really like someone they are looking for a specific person to you know for a specific position to work on the robots and from this yeah yeah queer perspective for example but another thing is like you know you just apply to the proposal i mean always you apply with your proposal i guess but like you can you know frame it so that like where i was working concordia university in montreal they have this program that also from masters actually that you can they basically promote interdisciplinary research so you can just do anything you want but you have to find your supervisors and you know frame your research whatever course you take you have to do it by yourself you do work with dance you work with media economics whatever but you have to you have to define it by yourself yeah and i think that i i think if i do phd i would do something like that at the same time i feel still like reluctant because it yeah because i have to work on something like not it's okay to work on something that i want to do but of course there's bureaucracy needed and it's not just filling papers but you really have to work on the papers that yeah of course this is the constant of business you need to review constantly you're writing yeah it's like i'm recording the english girl with the long hair she's part of the symmetry group and then she was we were so with anil and curry yesterday and then um she was i mean so we were joking with this like we are doing a phd here on puff on the housekeeping and then she was saying so we were talking about our works what we're doing niela myself and then she's saying that she cannot see herself like that for her like being working in three projects at the same time like artistic project is like she cannot see herself doing something like that and then we were we were saying that like seeing herself like or seeing myself uh doing the phd it just seems so much commitment into uh one specific thing um so it was it was more like i guess this acknowledgement of wow what this that you're doing is so good it's good that you're doing it i'm not gonna do it but it's so good that you're doing it and then she was saying also that in a way or in the phd then you will have in a way space to do kind of like micro projects because it's so in-depth project and you need so much different angles to what you're doing that you can have different frameworks within your main topic let's see yeah like in engineering well probably depends on the school but i think for writing a thesis you have like two options one is to really write the thesis and the other option is to compile the papers you publish because you so it's like those papers are like projects in a way so you work on like a bigger scope but of course you have to have kind of milestones tangible results that you publish as a paper because that's also of your job to you know be part of the academic community i don't believe in it that only happens with papers but that's not how it works in academia she published papers and that already it's like i would say micro it's like um the chapter of the thesis so that's what when you publish it you already have those reviews you already have the part of those thesis and then you compile it of course you have to have the productions and conclusions and stuff but the the beat um [Music] stitching videos is so hard not hard but i cannot do it with one script so maybe we finish it here and we'll see next time [Music]", "5cbqJzylRD0": "hello hey where are we so this is our digital me we are now in buff the performing arts forum in san telm france but yeah we just came from essen passing one night at home in brussels and yesterday was quite an adventure yeah oh my god we can we can talk about it and that's like that's the you know you know if we talk the whole story that's what one chapter one chat yeah oh my god but basically so we're on time we took the train we had a ticket for sure and but the route doesn't didn't exist no apparently the very first thing was that the first train was late yeah and we're so stressed and it seems like the connection was not possible because it didn't exist and then it turned out that it actually doesn't even exist in the first place so we talked with the guy and from the station and he was telling us that so this doesn't exist i don't know how he booked it but i give you a document that covers part of the trip because the second part of the trip is in france and it's not under their administration so they give gave us the paper that proves to go to lille but from there they also gave us a kind of document for refund for but basically we had to talk with the department in france since we have to figure it out no actually no but what we did is i called the belgium international train office and then the guy said like just book buy this cj we cannot provide you this ticket and then just you invoice us that as to pay the difference between what you pay originally and the rest which is the french tickets but that came the second because that was at the tourney and first we got the document in once no but there was already a range from from from months and months when i called the guy he told me that yeah yeah that was the call he said like in short he said like we cannot do anything in in france right so you have to book this and then you have to follow this path and then ask for a reinforcement of the difference between the money that you pay and the originally and the money that you paid at the end between your departure and arriving in france okay okay because that maybe that's that was that but i didn't understand that way so because then we arrived so we took the second train to tokyo and then we went to the counter and she was and she said she cannot help but she gave us the number no aya that wasn't her name yeah yeah there was a woman no then he called but but she gave us the itinerary which that was very useful so we don't have to check the phone all the time and it's printed out and we could actually book those tickets with ajv and the local one online which is kind of stupid but we did it and that's we have to figure it out how to get it reimbursed but it should be reimbursed so it was long but and then we arrived in london at 11 at 11 they have to say train trench trains are on time we arrived in six parts later 11. it was exactly in the i checked it was exactly yeah also the connection in paris it was okay there were nothing like four or five minutes late but they catch up because one day we arrived it was at the time that originally was planned yeah so the problematic ones are belgian and german trains we also had problem in cologne oh my god um that was so oh okay this chat is apparently about transport well we kind of what is the problem with colin like when i was going also to to arts electronica in calm also but that was a strike so there is an excuse well it's an excuse yes i mean at least i thought like it's okay normally in germany that won't happen it's just right but yeah in general it's really screwed yeah and what was worse in cologne was that the next rain was in two hours so we had to kill two hours there instead of one hour anyways and like yeah like so last night we were just calling taxi like numbers like everything possible yeah at the end we have to call john felix here so john felix if you're watching this and i know you know but if you see that at some point like you really appreciate that you came to pick us up sorry otherwise we had to sleep in the parking lot yeah because walking was not a possibility it was 17 kilometers it was four hours of walk from long till here so in the dark like in the middle yeah also the route is quite like like there's nothing i need i guess i pause it for now okay so it was very short i shouldn't have cut it but i cut it because what happened i mean a part of all this madness train madness what's going on what are we gonna do here we're going to do here we have kinect we have two t-nets we have a space we have a lot of things so you want me to tell what we have we have heartbeat sensors i found another kind of harvest sensor not an optical one but electricity one the one for pressure uh yeah i'll show you so not only the optical yeah i have two kind now we have sp32s so microcontrollers we have arduinos we have electronics and things like that so that's electronics we have a motion capture thingy kinex so we have a kinect we have two kinetics and then we have a smoke machine that's nice always cloud smoke we have some dm one dmx light and here there is another dmx light on what else do we have um add a green key as we took it oh yeah yeah we have a green nice i don't have much i have my computer yeah another thing that i guess i don't remember right now yeah we have some things nice like just to see what happens with that yeah i have brought all these cables so here in path you have analog tvs like i think like at least 15 of those so and when i met now to one year ago my first map the beginning of my research i was working a lot uh and on the spirit of nanju peck with a lot of analog tvs and signals like converting digital digital to analog and all the way around and i have all these converters and cables with me so that's something interesting to play also right both directions um yeah that's so that's things that we have and i think so we came here i think because we want to present like a hybrid performance from the best practice in contemporary dance that we present the importance basically i mean something that is at the impulse dance just showed up right we were not planning to do that right but they just presented us the possibility to just go in the performance mode of a practice so this is something that we want to do for the buy of the project um yeah so i'm very excited to maybe i'm not so excited to install xcode again in my computer because that will take eight hours but i don't have it no because i erase it at some point i don't need this thing it takes like 20 it takes like literally like 10 gigabytes and it keeps updating itself no i i know it and because you said open framework so i was like okay maybe you have it already i wouldn't even ask because that's like i had when i learned in my school it was one year ago and i worked with machine learning and some things but then after i felt like you know why i mean every time i just keep on asking like do you want to install this thing it's taking like three hours yeah yeah it's crazy especially with i mean also windows visual studio it's quite big like when you do like unity and stuff like that it's also quite bad but xcode is like another level somehow annoying somehow you get all the ios development and you have different versions and then you have these add-ons and but they are just that it's just such a nightmare but that's the only way to do it well it's not true but what's the easiest way to do have you ever worked with tinder not so much i mean cinder not tinder i think there is a more even i think low level version of open framework no it's i mean how i see it is it's more optimized in a way for a digital image like 3d rendering okay like i okay it's not for 3d rendering yeah but any generative stuff but i think cinder is something that it has clear philosophy it makes sense like open frameworks is more like hackers came together and try to make something that works for what they do like you know like installations and stuff so it's like a bunch of libraries and they kind of try to make it coherent but it's more like they just keep adding things on top of it but cinder i feel like they have like clear idea on what they do and i think it's more optimized in a way but the code it seems more complex yeah yeah that's why because open 5x is more like processing so it kind of makes sense to write in a way like the only difference i would say that you have to set up the resources so you have this i don't know how it's called but it's like kind of kind of like a header page where you assign the resources but if you don't even know how to work with that for reason but they teach me that they say like don't touch it no one they just give it to you and they just you go to the app basically i think it's more like unity because how you work is basically you set up a scene yeah this object is here this object is here and you can move things around but it's more like yeah like unity scene but open frameworks is like you can do it that way but also you can do something completely different well it's so funny because when i went to ccl for the first time choreographic coding labs in new york um it was at new york university and the quite some students from there are joining and they all use cinder for some reason i don't know why but they all use cinder and their projects are like you know connecting the motion capture data into cinder and do some kind of visualization they made something it's quite quite nice that in five days they put things together i couldn't i missed part of the presentation so i didn't follow everything meanwhile i was using open frameworks but why cinder because you learned it no because no no we i learned open frameworks okay but the guy who was working who was given the class who is an artist i mean but he's one of the people that they would call constantly to do or art work or in between designer art museums commercial things somebody who really know this work around and then he was he was running because when he was teaching chris i think his name hey chris he was like in a bit hurricane constantly saying like i did this this this this this this this four hour class two hours could be just like going which is interesting the first classes then if you have no idea of this thing what can you do right but it is every class is about how cool is him that is a bit like so at some point he was saying like mention cinder and they're nice because i'm very curious so they ask what is this and he said like you don't want to go there and that's it i think that was my center experience wow interesting yeah he said you don't want to go there you don't need it i also like cinder is like i think it's run by company and they use it for their installations i think so that's like also very different from open frameworks because it's open source yeah i mean they're both open source with open frameworks it's just like random people with same interest building something together but cinder is like run by like more like a yeah with a clear direction i think it's same with open rndr like render open or er that's like more recent ones um but it's uh it's a studio actually built the framework for their installations and they also open sources i have no idea that's interesting that's language is in kotlin language it's a it's for i think it kind of made it for android but it's like a framework or is it a language it's a language itself it's like a java alternative well that's my understanding and [Music] you can do some weird syntax with it and i think they somehow found it interesting so they made a kind of processing like thing for kotlin that's open r dr or basically but you can like embed shader as an object or something like because in the pipeline you usually have this shader is applied to a texture you know you like touch the liner as well like you have this texture and then you plug the shader as a pipeline and then you have another shader and another shader but in constantly i mean under the hood it's the same thing but rdr is something like you have this shader that's attached to not to the texture i want to draw a circle and i won't attach shader to it instead of saying like okay i render this circle and this no i don't i didn't understand that because what you have what usually happens is you prepare a buffer like a frame buffer and you draw something and you apply shader yeah that's always how it works that's basically a texture that you put on top of what it what do you do yeah but i think what i understand from open rdr is more like you draw a shape and you attach a shader to it so what you draw a shape and then there's a shader attached to that effect to the from the beginning from the beginning yeah like kind of maybe i'm understanding it wrong but somehow it works differently like it's not like it's different from uh open frameworks as a philosophy because the good thing from open frameworks as i understand is like because you separate the shader from the object then you consume so many resources or you can assign you can i mean you can be more clear in how many resources you want to assign in different parts of the pipeline right yeah so that's what i don't understand from this uh kotlin open our india clear language yeah i need to but actually it's similar to the framework that hydra is using because hydra is also weird in a sense that everything is cheap but hydra interprets isn't it but we have this conversation an interesting conversation that they were mocking me because i said like java javascript doesn't did not it doesn't compile the code but interprets the code which is different than compiling yeah we had this conversation with matthias right yeah but there was a clarification that peter stayed which is quite nerd uh hello peter that was my teacher at the school and a friend a part of its collective um he was he wanted to embed uh to use hydra in touch designer okay so and then i said i answered something and i said like you have to compile this and he made the clarification he said like uh yeah by the way like javascript is not compiling but it's just interpreting it's translating i actually don't know because javascript is such a weird language that i think they actually do compile part of the code to optimize it i don't understand completely but my what i what i read is basically interpreter yeah it doesn't generate machine code for generating for running javascript code but they somehow optimize part of the code that is used frequently as a byte code to speed up okay but not the entire thing yeah so it's like hybrid yeah okay i see okay interesting yeah they do like really weird stuff yeah because you don't have to set up the app no and it's so sketchy you know what people do with all these websites yeah peter is peter is he he's that's his candy peter loves javascript he really likes javascript so weird yeah and then you know like either you have to accept it or you have to understand everything yeah and peter is more like the kid like the case you really understand the way how he writes his code is like very functional using functional programming and he really i mean he's trying to like and he will speak about poetics uh code poetics and he's uh i really interested in working with these people in new york so it's called called this university in new york this place where sfpc school for foreign locations yes yeah yeah it's not it's an artist's run space yeah yeah yeah javascript crazy like for example there's class syntax but there's doesn't make no sense like class is at the end it's an object like everything like at the end of the chord because i i mean i learned that in my in my bootcamp because i have to repeat this subject for mike if you're watching this but actually thank you because i have to do it two times then it's anyway so then everything at the end in javascript is just our objects they're just our objects so this class at some point they put it with a the es15 with atma script then classes at the end are just objects so nobody really uses these classes because it's just they have no different hierarchy in the way how they work yeah so javascript is very liberal there is no class they're only functions and prototypes i mean objects and prototypes that's my manifesto that i wrote but if there is no that's not true there doesn't exist prototypes in there that's that's also not true yeah prototypes are progress but the prototype was an object at the end but it's a part of the object but it's yeah but it's it's something what is it this is an example this is the the french exam this is the french exam of yesterday now it's like the numbers yeah like at the when we board the train we have to validate the ticket and my qr code somehow didn't work so i had to say the date of birth and i was like oh nearly nerfed my birth year crazy yeah i think millennials are quite happy that they just have to say do me something but um anyways no i don't know actually first but if you see the inspector you have the prototype right yeah i know but like i'm telling you that's not that i mean but from what i understand it's not i mean yeah i know what you're saying but at the at the end it's an object because if there is a prototype that it represents so what is a prototype but it's a part of the feature of the object yes but that's but okay but then that part of the feature of the object is called how it's called that um an attribute of the object that's called an attribute just a feature it's just anything not feature not in the sense that it like more like abstract thing that i'm saying object has a prototype but a prototype is an object i see what i mean it's an object at the end so i understand so an object is a prototype but a prototype is an object before become the object is a prototype but the prototype is an object in itself i don't think so uh but wait no because objects can have an object yes so the object can have vortex yes and protect can have prototype yes and then an object and so object prototype can have a prototype an object can have a prototype and then a prototype can have a prototype a prototype it's an object i don't know but it's an object it is an object i mean it's like it's for inheritance right yes exactly exactly exactly yes it is so you don't have to copy everything from the parent no exactly and then actually because you i mean normally the way how you do it but if you really go and use because in the way why they were teaching these things uh the way how you refer to this once you start referring to the prototype you see that it's an object when you start using willian just to check that the result back is an object [Music] the prototype will say like the type will be an object but then what's special about prototype i don't know i mean for what i know like in prototype what is the thing with so i learned from prototypes then the prototypes is this the way how you because in java it's very clear why you need to use prototypes because in that way you start referring to these uh you start referring to certain uh parts of your in your program without the need to uh with the wait with the prototype but the purpose you cannot modify first no the prototype is like a setup yeah and then you yeah yeah maybe it's not that the work anyway but then what you do with the prototypes you keep referring to there in in a in a context you say prototype is i think yeah because if you have let's say draw function in prototype you cannot edit it but you can add draw function like over overwrite overload yeah or overwrite overwrite as draw of that object but it is a new object it doesn't have yeah it doesn't change exactly it's a new object yeah yeah that's the way how you change like uh you then you chain and then you use the function javascript that just create new arrays arrays with functions arrays with objects uh down inside at the end everything with the n is an object it's a big object with more objects inside yeah so when you make a class use a class syntax it's just a function and then add prototype if there's the inherited exactly yeah somehow that's something but then at the same time it becomes tricky because then if you because of this it works in a different way different content con [Music] it will it works differently how you refer with these in in java let's say i know from java the context of this in javascript is uh it will refer to the [Music] the current context especially yeah yeah the current content exactly yeah you can yeah yeah yeah instead yeah this but it's calling here inheritance yeah because in java instead you come from different objects you refer to a different uh prototype and will be fine if you try to do this in javascript without doing some magic or something then you can have the unexpected result because of the scope because in java you compile but i think but in javascript then it will send you back and forth to different places and you easily you can have errors yeah but that's the problem with the scope it's not with the important no but i hope the whole point i think there are some jokes inside youtube javascript like developers the whole problem with javascript is scope because at the end it's a language about scope i mean because you can use it um different times how it's called this like adjective what agent stands for or as in asynchronously because javascript you can use it as a synchronously then why i was telling you that it's cool let's go yeah because of this code because javascript is not like it's not compiling you all in once to run the program but if you can use it as synchronously then the scope can get very confused you can go to you can easily go to have unexpected things you know what even if it's asynchronous the scope is defined by how you write the code yeah but that's the whole thing how you write the code in javascript it's just messy you don't really sometimes you don't have you don't really understand that's what is the whole point if you try to debug because the problem is like in java if something is not right it will tell you it cannot compile it cannot run the program right but javascript will bypass that and give you something that you might not expect and if you have been working for a long time without the structuring the code you are in big trouble right yeah that's because of the the nature of the code that was that was the note that was the i think that the slogan of the nodes one year ago by the way one year ago we were just there now in frankfurt yeah the nature of code is dancer ayat is done hello dan hey dan did you did i saw like it so when i present and maybe not in the chat like so when i when i presented my school the the presentation of my thesis i think i have just two questions and one of the questions that i received is that if i still speak with danielle schiffman and i thought that was a bit weird because he was he wrote once in the in the live stream in a chat and olivia also was there yeah it's so funny the main two things that we use is made by olivia we have why we have a like captain biter exactly that would be so like olivia in the chat she's like a guru so yeah we were in frankfurt one year ago and so and i just put something because i think in a process really meant different things because already we have been working for five months online we didn't met so we didn't experience like being next to each other and then just we went to sleep in the same room for six nights somewhere in the green room yeah they had a different theme for like different colors for the guest department oh yeah i don't know what giant really was but it was yeah that's so funny and alex was taking one of the rules to alex aya the other creator yeah and poor uh yeah like they're moving around in airbnb that was actually okay but this is political this is not we're gonna go there the bathroom was uh like behind the kitchen something like that yeah i remember because carlos one of the people who you have all these technicians who were like the production of this thing was very high not like it was live it was not live i mean it was a tv set right so and they have people constantly working at that night you have to do this connection with new taking quebec so there was people uh working constantly on that carlos serrano one of them which is somebody who just present also a new now festival and sovereign essence uh he did a great job and he worked with neo sinclair yeah yeah and so let's just say that um but carlos told me that they were in next to the train station and that was like hardcore because you have all this junkie around and he has to come back around one in the morning sometimes he was just going walking with his computer crazy and they were like they were the technicians okay yeah yeah also that time was kind of still we're not sure with like what to do with kovid and i don't know hotels were like how they're operating i think but yeah because it was before it was before the second lockdown it was just before yeah like if it was one month later what happened yeah but i think like airbnb like finding them it's quite difficult because they didn't know what to do like i think tales were kind of open but uh yeah but the situation that wasn't clear and also the festival wise and it was i mean we were just very lucky with the it was very nice to be there anyways so there we did the chat uh no we did a lot of things we did the chat you created the whole week of the ccl online exactly but basically you hack you hacked the photographic coding lab with permission right you said i didn't even get first but you still asked the curator and director she kindly offered me to do something but not to do something i don't know like something specific but it's like some thing i did so it was really open we did some lunch we had the chat we did practice to which we failed but that's what i was trying like so i i underlined the message that i put for our process was very relevant because we i used the hashtag we totally failed because we were aiming to present something good at note and we failed um but that gave us the possibility to rethink or doing within digital dance dance and tech and technology uh ecology's uh labor uh queer technology like what were we doing basically because it was really a moment where we could say like okay we failed but it's all right so yeah it was a it was a milestone for us and since then the the practice i think it became what it is right now yeah it was very important for us yeah i remember like after the practice we went down and like we're chatting with others you know yeah we failed absolutely and by the way the link is there on my facebook page on my wall there is the link of the ghost computer that shows nothing in a vr space they just keep crashing because um i don't know why it's a good computer but like like inactive if you're inactive maybe on hubs like you just they just shut down but also we were using these hops on this that was so weird the sound was weird it just but we have some stage design we did stage design right yeah yeah yeah because also like it but it was nice that the you know we had the space virtually in hubs that gloria made we had a stage actually which we didn't know it was very beautiful i i really like this images of choreographic coding lab oh yeah they still still use those images in the festival and we use this it's a nice image like this thing i that that image is also nice and uh also there's like in the back there's uh exhibition of the past choreographic coding labs like i put some images there yeah um also yarn from uh fiber festival he told me about it laurian from motionbank passes by at some point to say hello and to give you some book you remember floating at some point i have the book that i'm presenting somehow no was it i think i was in the book you're in the book here because i see it it's part of like in medium you find you have this thing the motion bang often one of the publication is like you are there in the pictures like doing something i'm like presenting something yeah um yeah because that book was about that because because maybe because you're japanese okay talking guy talking japanese in strange language weird english now because that book was their project in that museum i think with this choreographer from finland i don't thought his name but this piece that dancers are running circle i don't know so they did this production and they did recordings so that they had motion capture of this whole piece and then the idea is that but it was not it wasn't the foresight no not even like because now it's independent i mean it's in the school uh mines uh motionback is part of that like as a department they have their own building it's kind of funny um and i'm gonna do my internship there yes so the book is about the project with this choreographer and then they did recordings they did some kind of analysis like visualization of the piece and they did exhibition in the same kunsthale mines uh with the video of the the dance piece itself and also visualization and stuff like that and during the exhibition we had the ccl there for five days okay so i was there during the cco and florian and this you know technical people they made this osce player basically there is the bank of the motion capture from the piece the dance piece and what is it the bank is updated in real time oh no it's just a bit it's just a database yeah this database recording and basically the idea is that it's always paying the ass to work with motion capture with if to set that on your computer and get the data you know read on processing or whatever but okay but then it's just because the motion capture is such a specific thing that there's no like a protocol but then what you have you need to use an interface just capturing the data the most you know so what is the interface that people were using to capture the motion okay so this first thing is just forget about this like if you work with motion capture it's very specific protocol because the company makes up makes up the whatever protocol that you have to use so it's hard and usually like setting up all these things takes like five days and the cco is done like to make the whole thing working takes so much time so instead of uh to avoid this hustle they made a player that is recorded already from the dance piece and you have this timeline so you can just like you know select from this point to the playback and it will emit it will just like broadcast the osc or websocket with a specific format so you can easily read it in on the browser or processing open frameworks okay i mean easily okay so you're broadcasting the data and then in other frameworks you just pull the data yeah and he already you know prepared some examples so it's easy to start with yeah that's the idea so that that was part of the ccl so because there's also like quite a lot of students participating in ccl in that edition because that was part of the university thing as well so they did some kind of visualization with this program and i was doing something else which was photographed and this whole process was in the book any medium online video yes then i wrote the medium art yes shall we close here but we want something to say yeah this is the this is the official this is the opening this is opening yes the sufficient opening of the residence at buff so we have to say something boring like uh important we need to be important yeah the minister of culture of germany again well minister of best practices whatever you need to have they are very formal and stupid very formal yeah so what are we going to do get some food get some food yes yes and rest recover from the trip and then i guess we will start like playing uh setting up things slowly and really i haven't done those you know setting hacking things download download xcode oh my gosh that will be something maybe i actually before i go i just start downloading this package yeah i already downloaded notch installed notch oh yeah we have also this nudge also with us that's that's an easy way to have a good template for high-end images and 3d space generative yeah maybe we end up this whole week just making high-end kinect images i hope no no but the school that we have is the first time that we have the hardware so we have sensors we have sp 32s we don't have inflatables we don't have inflation we can have mpcd yes we can say that multiplayer [Music] because this is gamepl that is for woosa like they don't find so much documentation or at least when i was using them because there are so many different sp 32s that you can find in the project that i they i present with joe caimo in us electronica we experiment with different kind of sp32s until we find one that was okay and good documentation so that will be something to check to make it work online okay so we'll see maybe we present some high-end images tomorrow so that was like the video i don't think anyone's watching till this moment but please like the video and subscribe ciao", "D4HbfgzSmdk": "finally hey so we're walking welcome to this local slow dance how was called the performance the dance walk dance walk yes this is how they like say the chapters like they have different editions yeah this is the chat edition uh yeah this is the child edition of the transport we can hashtag them yeah and they'll send it to them yep cool so what were we talking about about preparing aya preparing because we could have had uh jorge's tripod that's like a selfie stick thing right yeah it's a bit longer than what you have yeah yeah but that like when this kind of thing like i should have brought this or i should have set this up that's like the practice i always think about because yes but like i used to like really regret oh why why i did not exactly but now i'm like yeah whatever you know like we improve it next time which is good you know yeah yeah i think that's the beauty of like when you work not towards an object but you work in a framework because towards an object you have the pressure of like this is it you know like there's a point when you need to finish and because of the nature of art then you will try to work towards perfection and yeah and and that's just not possible you know like yeah so when you have just a framework instead of an object then it's all good because you can just go back to the framework and maybe you will solve it or you will remember to bring the other tripod maybe not but at the same time it will be fine but what is the framework no because i was thinking what because now we're doing this but if i want to start something new where should i start because i can't really think about okay i'm gonna make a new framework no but i mean but yeah you see what you mean but i was thinking that like that a framework is something that gives you agency in relate to some specific thing so said i think in a way i think frameworks cannot be a framework is a technology at the core you know what i think i should be this side because this is um there will be more sculptures on that side so a framework is a technology a framework is a compound of things that are not that not necessary need to be uh know the use for i mean for the creators but it's just it's like as technology is is something that gives possibility for other things to be read or utilized by others um so even though the work is in frame it's not you i don't think if you can uh start working in a framework by going directly to the work i mean or i will maybe say that i think it's more natural if the framework comes to you then you go into the framework because that's more science based methodology that's that's doesn't that's a scientific approach to how you can create methodologies and find frameworks to iterate processes right so but then is that so i think that's the difference like we have an approach where we did not find the work but the work find us and designs normally the other way around you find the work and then you apply the methodology so then you find you find you you get a work and then you put it into a framework [Applause] what is work like a concrete example uh this is work anything that anything that consumes energy is work okay so this is what we do already work but in science in science that's the hard difficult thing difficult thing i but what do you mean understanding what you're saying what do you mean in science like or in physics because it's that we're doing this work for the body he's burning allergies energy yeah and i think it's not different than in any other context okay i think i have two strict way of thinking in science so that's why i'm having difficulty understanding what you're saying because in science okay there's methodology but basically what happens is you have some um hypothesis like you expect something to happen yes so you find the methodology yes to achieve that you do some conclusions then you just you see what is the next steps yeah because it will not happen as the exact way that you expected so you kind of from the conclusions or the results you have to find why it was not the same or why why it was the same as you expected and then you have another hypothesis i think that's kind of my understanding yes that's that's understandable but you're saying so so you say that you understand that as two things one is that one that's a scientific approach scientific yes and which is like you like so this is in relation to work we are talking about work but what is like because work because that's the difficult thing i'm okay having yeah i'm having difficulty because in this process what we do work i understand like this is work what we did yesterday as a child is work yeah anything can be framed work but then in science in a way there's no like achievement because you can do experiment but experiment itself is often doesn't mean anything it might be failure even if it's success you have to evaluate it it does not come as a ube by itself no but we do it that way yeah but in science also you have like it's heuristics like aldo is not heuristic by definition meaning that you have eureka moments right um you do have break i mean like that's what is science and then so although you have all the scientific approaches you uh describe and the steps nevertheless when there's something that in a way you can prove that you pass through peers at some point and somehow you can say like herica and that can change things so that contradicts in itself the method the scientific methodological methodology methodological research until somebody proved the contrary because that's science so if you think in einstein for instance like when he put his theory it was and it still is it now you just start to being contradicted but for a long time nobody could contradict the guy and in science normally you have that approach is based on because it's epistemological we spoke so many times of that is basically is in search of prove you wrong or is it this dialectic where you try to basically based on theory and knowledge you try to stand a point so i'm right based on this otherwise you prove me wrong so if you're einstein you prove your theory i have to prove you wrong based also of yeah i just prove you groan based on knowledge basically and research yeah i think that really also captures what i was saying trying to say that there is like no point that is like okay this is the work because even if you publish a paper and if even if it is accepted by you know famous journal nature or whatever it doesn't mean that it's the truth because as you said other scientists have to i will say i will then say it's a temporary truth like you have to i think you have no but yeah i mean wait so then you have to prove me wrong with this then so then we agree this is the mythological approach of the scientific research right then it has to basically pass through a uh exclusive group of knowledgeable people like you in that field yeah they have to review it once in a way they can agree then it stays there until somebody else come and prove you wrong and then it goes on and on and on um but this is i think this is a tricky part of like academic uh research in general that [Applause] it's only valid if like no one can prove you wrong basically proves you wrong but also people are interested in it because i'm not sure about them if something is like they just wait for the party [Applause] because what you do is uh the okay i write a paper that something like about no one cares but it's somehow reviewed and passed the process so it's published but no one reads it let's say okay then it was actually something like not true what i wrote but somehow it was reviewed and it was published but it should be true i mean if it's not true that your their review will not pass but it's not perfect they can't do the same experiment that's the problem with the reviewers that they can read the paper but they cannot redo the experiment because it's a review process that's for other researchers after publicly published they can do the experiment to prove it wrong or you know differently but either but the reviewers so that's not the rigorous job if there's something sloppy in the paper they the reviewers can say that okay this might be wrong can you check that or can you give me more you know proof uh insights insights or yeah like results that's possible but the reviewers cannot prove it so other after the publication other researchers have to do the experiment but then if this is something completely useless but still reviewers found something useful so they published it you know then although let's say i'm lying you know it was like a fake experiment but if it was published and no one's interested in that paper then it will not be retracted it will not it will just stay there as the truth so it's like a what i wanted to say is it's not like there's no point that it's actually a work or there's the truth in academic paper because it's a constant process that's what i would say can you repeat that there's no point that someone discovered this or you know from this time this time it was like this theory was proven to be true yeah but it's a constant discourse is it this course or is it dialectic i mean the discord understand understanding that this course are something that is being sent in one direction now that's a discourse it's not a dialectic process the discourse is something that you just said and it goes out dialectically expect something back okay well actually i don't know what's the right word because no it's not even like is it dialectic what or like in science in science is dialectic at the core because it's basically just based on knowledge is like this is my because it's said in science in a way it's like it's like an ongoing conversation sciences in general and then i speak right now this is my truth these are my facts all these things that we mentioned and then somebody else will come yes but no because of this so there is this is there is the process so this is dialectic at the core that's hegel at the core yeah what i what i'm not sure is because everything takes time like i can't cannot just reply to you if you say something i cannot say like well maybe i can say something back to you but sometimes it takes time and that makes the glitches in a way that's interesting yeah because i'm trying to see that please keep what you have i i just think that it's interesting in in enlarging the scope because i'm seeing the conversation and it's just hello how are you couldn't but it's just in science in projects and the glitch in between this is something that i found interesting the whole thing is just yeah it's just we both we we're speaking about something that we don't really know right and actually i really like to like i did some research before about like the fraud and like papers that were like completely like fake experiment well partially but so the result was false but somehow it was published because it was from the famous it's not even famous professor but maybe from a famous research institute and they did like fake experiment and for their fame right it's not to have a prank but because they're so competitive plays you have to have constantly have results so this sometimes leads to this situation where fake results are published and these things are to me what's interesting is that as soon as you publish no one can say like even if intuitively you think it's something's wrong with this paper you can point that out as soon as soon as you publish as soon as you publish you're basically waiting somebody's gonna find out something well hopefully not because they are they pretend that it's a real experiment but you have but at the core like would be very much like this imposter in poster syndrome in psychology you know that imagine that imagining that what we do is like so it's review somehow it's out you will be constantly thinking like you open your email like maybe somebody found out something yeah but the thing is if there's something really sloppy that well there are things like that like some graphs are wrong because it's a fake experiment so there are some weird things and as a reader you can point those things out but it will really take time to figure out that it was actually the core is fake and it's not just like a mistake but usually these things happen with like a point pointing out the mistakes like they're probably this axis of this graph looks really wrong but it's fine i mean yeah so what i found interesting and what you're saying is that because we in a way we are talking we we favor the glitch right so in this conversation what i found interesting is that the process actually you're buying time to allow the glitch to happen because during that process until somebody can prove you wrong then some things can happen so then you're basically buying time so actually then that's a framework but that's what i understand the framework let me expand that so because then basically your research paper is just a framework it's an excuse basically for other things to happen in between the paper is just a time that you're buying for the glitch to happen and that's a framework for me yeah i mean of course it's not a good thing to do but but what is what do you mean good because that's that's the it's like specifically about the fraud like you know yeah something was fake but even if it's um like real experiment there can be some mistakes in the but like i understand what you're saying but to be honest then i don't i'm not so interested in playing the police of science no no that's that's not what i want to say and that's why i'm interested in these uh this uh you know fraud fake papers in science because that really well it's dramatic but also like why this happened from the pressure from the school from the institution and then all these you know small um facts show up right like some people point out and then then the journal asks the author to redo the experiment or you know it becomes like really big and then finally it turned out that they are you know faking the results or they just disappear it happens also i think and yeah like why this happens and all the the process and the as i said it's not the processes that like you know after one minute of the publication someone says that this is wrong but it happens gradually as we said about cliff but i think i don't really understand why you are so interested in this that we're talking because i i mean i understand what you said but know the interest in what you're saying because i don't find it interesting that uh it's science but it's not it's not science this part like it's what supports science is not very square yes it's very organic in a way because they're organic or it's very square because the two things are conservatory no it's it's not square it's not square i'm sorry and it's organic um because science has to be you know true you know something has to be true or false yeah but what supports it or this whole like like this conversation happens then to prove that the paper is wrong but this whole thing is really organic it's human right to to prove that it's true or false that's but that's really but that's interesting because then you touch the human there yeah because that's human and then as human then we are entitled to contradict ourselves so for instance like if you said that it's a square and it's organic i would like to start like training myself and accepting that that's true because that's that's the walt whitman says something in the poem called i don't remember it says that this is the you can ah then i contradict myself then so be i contain multitudes he says and and then and and that's at the core of what we're trying to say here like i don't need to know so and it and and that was saying like in i think in the 30s in a really uh wide patriarchal uh society so he's white and people were really trying to understand him like but what do you mean with that like why you're saying that and it's a poem but it's so precise in what he's saying with that it's just giving agency for the post-human that's really back in time yeah the guy acknowledged all these things uh heteronormativity and all these patriarchy called bound bounding boxes that we have no but in the end science doesn't allow this multiplicity but i guess it depends on the field of science actually yeah so of course we were speaking some times ago like if there is neurology then because it's not so mature then they can allow because they don't have so much papers to contradict something while in other fields they can maybe say radically no that's absolutely wrong and this this is why i'm trying to think like actually for the last yeah already like a few months i was trying to think what kind of thing we can do with neuroscience because i think if we do something scientific that's the right place at the nature of you know the field but and i have some context but like what's like how do we frame it maybe we just just start have to like talking with those people too yeah we might invite them to our chat basically and talk with them to see what they think yeah that's interesting absolutely i think it's a good ending yeah i think my arm is very tired neurology and so neurologists around the world please contact us subscribe subscribe like this video and we will see you in the next one probably where will we could be later on here still in nassen or could be back in brussels could be whatever yeah i think there are so many things also that we have to we still have to talk about the about the chat yesterday so but we close this one here okay thank you for watching ciao", "JqPZBdOrVlE": "[Music] [Music] um [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] like this [Music] three more minutes [Music] [Music] oh [Music] foreign [Music] that's awesome [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign okay [Music] is not the last but the one before the last presentation of this day and the artists are already sitting on the stage so we have different settings [Music] they question the productive aspect of cooling to speculate its new form now otto is basically the background in engineering and he's currently enrolled in diplomas [Music] [Music] technologies and sociology with a strong body orientation approach coming from a master's degree in contemporary dance he studies multimedia communication technology and by the way he's just coming straight from the aft electronica he was the last legit friend from 8th to 12th of september we're very happy that he joined us here welcome now to both of you those youth afterwards we have a very small chat together okay so uh thank you guys for being here uh people who are live i'm working so i think briefly i would like to buy uh for the time of the duration time that we will have there is about an hour i think to be comfortable at the uncertainty because we certainly don't know so uh as a first act as a symbolic act i would like to invite us to take just two minutes uh to be here and so to be silent and then just acknowledge the knowledge in the body so not only us but the technicians and everybody just to take two minutes where i mean you do what you need to do but i propose that just keep space for your body and just if you need closer eyes okay so this will be from now so [Music] so [Music] so so so [Music] [Music] [Music] okay thank you very much so welcome back uh we are here now i think but now [Music] there is some keyword codes that you will see behind each of the columns there is a qr tools our qr codes and they will prompt you to this uh google government there is a part of how we deal with what we do basically and it's an invitation basically to there is also some useful links like the main website about practice there's an academic paper some more uh background of the practice um maybe because on youtube i know that if you post url it will be rejected but i'll try so i mean we did this in part because we were having a discussion with now how to not like share i mean i didn't want to justify my question with my credentials telling you how good or bad depending on your eyes and also although the framework that we have the battle that is about digital dance and dance and technology it's called best practice in contemporary dance and it's containing two parts a practice and a chat we were invited here to do a chat which is the rational aspect of the practice if you want to get more like information on what the practice is i think rather than be telling you what is it like in the presentation mode then you guys can use the qr code where you can find the main website an academic paper and all the information you the main page that has some videos i don't know what was the last one oh yeah that was an impressive almost no more than one like [Music] [Music] this this serves as a canvas from there you can find hyper links so this was the last presentation in the equals that's period i would like to say that i would like to speak more about that but here you can find there is uh then we find the archive of the practice and also uh on archive the chat basically at this point we have 148 hours of digital content that you can find in youtube so you can find different hyper names also you can find different websites that we have also if you click in the uh in this lottery pieces that you go to this uh this will be my master thesis i did on the project so it's an academic paper you can download it and it wasn't wrong with it okay so it is okay with you i think i would like to go back to the chat this is what we're doing so we have the document we usually don't take notes because we record it and if we need it we watch it or we take notes individually but it's not like a collective but today we'll just try a collective mode for us but also for you to see it real time and maybe write down anything you want to say also you can just you know maybe write your contact write your work so you can explain that you presented at you now which is awesome i don't know if anyone about it but um the thing is we don't have slides because this the whole point is that we do it on the fly improvisationally and no agenda right yeah but i will maybe underline that this is it comes from in the researches like we the research has the bodies at the bottom it's at the core of everything so as an art of resilience we don't know and we try to stay in the abdominal place we try to reach the we favor the glitch and the error so rather than use patriarchal as the speaker was saying like an intention where you have to know what are you doing in this world so we try to insist in a format that is not pretending to have a performance at the end so it's just a framework and because we haven't been insistent and not knowing at the end of how you know something that maybe it's useful to support the bodies but you know certainly it has helped me a lot with my own things nevertheless i try to not hijack what i do understand my identities i try to not politize but it's not my intention to do political art say for listening like uh today what's his name johnny johanni the artist from brussels his work i really really appreciate that some people do this kind of thing that they have like they they really believe in somebody and so i can do some political intentions with it but my intention between my art is not uh it's not political i think in doing or if you do if i do art in the proper way then it will just express the expression meaning that it will not try to tell you what you have to think but it might just portray it and pass by therefore i will say there is this is not a performance let's say the practice itself is more of performance but this is nevertheless a performative act there is a difference because the performance it will deal with identities very much but the proformatic performance it stays close to the dance which is more expressing the expression in that sense you can compare it with experience experiencing sound when you experience dance or experience sound it's just an embodied experience that exists in the now before an art before and after there's just comments well i don't know i'm sorry i didn't listen but um when you say like of course no no you said it's not we don't do political things but that like like image i had was like okay so we're so pure that we have a campus that we just draw from ours and that's like a maybe that's really boring moment but the thing is like whatever we do is important so that's like something that's kind of we have to acknowledge that we do something for fun and maybe individual flowers but whatever we do it is you like the fact that i am here it's just political and i want to underline that i'm from colombia and so on so i mean i don't want to go in there so it's just the body's political so in a way this is coming from a group that called feminism that it says like actually she quoted from somewhere else i don't know what exactly uh but it says like we already passed by the place of life should i be here i am here so so we so therefore since i am here and i can't be here uh then it's more after me what include my presence so then i'm interested that in my presence is like i try to renounce in a way or trying to challenge the unity that i was giving as a body and the assumptions that i received i i receive as a taxonomical assumptions about my gender and stuff like that and it's an ongoing process but it's not political i mean you cannot avoid politics now what i'm trying to do is the body is qualitative but nevertheless like my intention with my approaches choreographer is like them so then find the ways one way is like the best practices is that to circumvent yeah i mean the thing is that it's a little bit like a meta but like this chat because it's about best practices and we do move and code and invest about like with status and technology all these things that we do like as a hands-on but before talking about all these technical things for example or i don't know what we learned from the breakfast itself we have to kind of start with something that is even before talking about best practices in the contemporary that's that we have to talk about the politics or like i don't know like why we do this why we are here for example like because we don't have to be here like it's just like upload videos and um i mean of course it's nice to have visibility i don't know actually why people present that question before it's for business i mean it's a bit tricky because i think the network network never working [Music] that's why i think intentionally at least i try to it's just like boycott myself try to request myself like do not stay in quality do not speak about your colony or like do not go about the gender i will go there because this is me but then i have a clear intention to try to do something and unfortunately like this area is very german it's not like a big city like that like being here has already you know triggered something i mean the festival is really nice i think it's really well curated but of course like we can talk about you know how is the ratio of you know like race or i mean gender whatever it is yeah i mean i was just so uh i just came back from the afternoon we were like and then so i have all this expectations about how this is electronica and all of them there were that or more in terms of work network but then my personal side means i was like wow this is just so dead it was like there's nothing for me here what what am i doing here what are you guys here you know um and then of course because sisters find each other then i found the only queer aspect of the festival which was launched only this year after only 20 years that are running this year they opened a big network it's part of the arts electronica and they even didn't mention it in the festival because it's not important for them nevertheless i found it and of course i really connect with them so what i'm trying to share with this is like um i think it's close to the art and science community which is different than the art and new media community art and science community which is very close to the science base it puts the body really far away in terms of like we are going to fix humanity but they don't realize that we are humanity and is is and is very difficult so i work with these collected uh seeds which stands for space ecology art and design and something we have a collaboration with the european space agency with uh space projects so it's a really design sheet-based collective and i have the same feeling so i just confirmed that feeling when i went towards electronica these scientists who really have a good intention to work uh they just put the body it's like we are gonna fix humanity somehow but then as is us or humanity that's what i propose at the beginning to take two minutes to just acknowledge that you are here that we are here and my process is my presence our presence is influence us so yeah the body is important [Music] i always talk about this but i like i used to organize a lot like well usually last year i was organizing a lot of online events to record it um and of course like there's this weird like opportunity like no one talking and i really like it um because i asked me and i uh wrote the statement the thing is that when noah talks then you know like some people think it's super awkward and i feel both what as well but i think it's so rich that it's like you know like i'm not like looking at the book and i have like you know 30 slices left but i just like being chill and look at the audience and you know just having this enjoying this moment so nice and having this conference like one hour of time for us is so generous and thank you for the organizers it sounds like a closing comment but uh yeah like i just want to say it because it's nice we can experiment with these things because we have a stage and i think that we have trust this vessel here [Music] she was going to bring up some drinks and yeah so we have never been in this situation we do this chat and basically we do it sometimes three times per week for one year and sometimes we don't do it in one month because then i'm busy or he's busy uh but this is the first time we have the possibility to be on stage basically not as performance but as i mentioned this is a anyway we don't speak like this when we don't have the microphone so it is a performance it is not a performance so this is interesting but we didn't create it as lecture performance and i think it's good that we didn't know because yeah but this is like also like a question because we started praying that so what we do as a practice is a practice that we need for one hour and we do whatever with movement or code or whatever with computers but it doesn't have to be functional like we don't expect to have like nice images nice choreography i don't know what nice portrait is but it's not that we go to like you know perfection but we just try it and we fail that's okay we do it again so it's okay uh why i like like this because what were you talking about not awkward yeah anyways we can fail and uh it's nice that we have a stage where we can actually fail yeah actually something we can share is like so so basically we meet like more than one year ago online and then we start just doing something and we didn't know what was it just like we have this interest in coding and dance and then we start basically competing and at some point we say like well this is kind of something and we end up with best practices in contemporance inside joke because if you speak in the contemporary dance field you will never say that you there is a best practice in somali practices right it's just like that i mean like if you imagine ballet is like something that you would you know you think that something is beautiful like what they probably have it can be anything that's why like there is no best like one best practice in body practice let's say but on the other side we have in technology and when i was finished my studies in interactive science then it was you have this practice in coding and i was one it was back in time that i was working with him that i wasn't studying best practices in in objective oriented languages so then i just thought ah best practices contemporaries uh as a provocative something in between and well before the impulse just two weeks a few weeks ago people were so so mad like what do you mean with best practices in contemporary guys because they are working for them we come in and we say okay we're the best so we're saying that that is something but then we somebody said like if you use the hashtag it just changes the assumption of life that's the best anyway oh yay so once i was doing the it's not even research that's a good research but looking for like articles writing about best practices and i just placed it here like for example like best practices for writing are both it's very concrete there should be a best practice because if everyone's writing dark holes in like really different ways then it's really hard and that's what happens with bad old in general i think they're not just art but you know c or javascript yeah so that's why there's like best practices also there's like practices in business management um this is more like i don't know i don't really know if it's really his purpose because if you look at an article this is engaged workers reward the vulnerable bloodlines for legionary we can throw they talk about these things like we can let's practice you know like be yourself so maybe the best practice is to turn off the be screen with yourself uh wait so i think maybe for the people who just joined guys they're in the back part of each column there's a qr code where you can start interacting with the document if you wish there are so many uh things like uh the main website is like a hyperlink psd thing it's going in the sense like there's a lot of what i believe let's say in the yeah yeah and this is like [Music] this is like what i like about this like recent type of trend is kind of going back to you know like beginning of the internet basically like trying to use like more hyperlinks and uh like weaponry that was it used to be a thing like i don't know like early 2000s now like some people some cool people do it because that's like a way to bypass the problem the whole problem with the social media for example because basically you don't use it but you connect with other people yeah so we use a lot of hyperlinks but he's using social media so [Music] because we were not planning to work basically so because of that thing is the labor part of the world is gone and it just becomes something that we create basically the space is basically a space of healing that we found where we [Music] yeah we were having this conversation today with uh janna yeah guys this is a space for me basically uh where you in my case i i'm very happy to not be motivated like you can't be one person and i have the excuse to go to the best practices to exercise self-association and then oh we have our people yes thank you for i have to acknowledge anonymous wall another spirit this is anonymous this is actually foreign interesting like that uh like if you go to like like google doors or like other tools like sometimes they use like animal as a like an anonymous user and that's kind of i don't know if it's a beautiful but it's a smart way of bypassing but like basically there's the gender race well actually that's not true because the animal belongs to you know they have origin so it's not exactly maybe because of how we picture the animal it's not like you know like we don't really see the real icons here so yeah that's i also like i think it's really important that the talk becomes so boring not because we are talking a lot but we don't know what they're saying so like you know i don't know maybe there's two earlier questions but also yeah at any point anybody wants to because normally so the child he's like i'm gonna paraphrase so i present them in my school but the child is the chat aspect of the time when the two of us comes together and sometimes i guess try to round and theoretically practice this it literally comes with that baby and not my heart so here anyway so this is the space that somebody i mean we're speaking from our truth this is not in no way an nevertheless this is what we experienced and we shared with you with no assumptions but so i was trying to say that yeah we're trying to favor right now that's the important point but before that i would say that uh i don't know if you were drinking if it's a tourist or not but uh um what no i'm sorry but we're thinking not saying that we're saying the truth but my truth and it's true um it's not even our truth actually because it's not like we share and i think it's important in our practice and the child is that not it's not that we try to like but we listen to each other and acknowledge and you know if like some things that i don't agree with what jorge it's okay as long as it's not harmful to me and that's also like for the audience as well and that's i think difficult in this setting because if we're just on youtube and you're watching the youtube video actually i didn't think about this before but then you can always even or like you can think that okay i don't want to leave this person so you know [Music] but if this is stream of the conference or if you're here then clearly they hired me that we were like that's why basically we're trying to you're trying to break the error not as an act of being like but it's just i mean i don't want to start like i don't want to have to show you my credentials again like am i worth it enough for you guys to be here so uh but then going back when you review what you were saying um so basically the fact one of the aspect is very important for me is that we try to give agency back to the user so instead of instead of telling the user what is interesting uh in a way so it's something the practice itself is in the space but not that this is the chat the practice is a is in space that is it lingers the threshold of anxiety and forgetting that it never interferes with the user but it holds him just enough but it will never interfere to tell what is very interesting for the user to see so sometimes we do it live streaming of seven hours so and that is a purpose because we are not if somebody is watching that non-stop for seven hours then i will feel that i'm failing somehow but so we do that so long is because we are trying to give back agency like you tell me what is there for you i don't try to like show you the best five minutes and a half at least an hour and that's important because it's trying to give back the agency not only as a user but as a human yeah i mean i think what's what could be really interesting with that idea and this setup is like not that we're giving it walk but how well that's a little bit pretentious like how do we inspire other people like what do you think but not inspired like what you get from this and like how do you transform it well that's a wall but you know no but i would i would feel comfortable with like saying by inspiring like it's not that i'm trying to be able to follow the world model like i mean i don't know like i'm drinking right now on stage like okay so it's not my intention to be any yeah i'm just trying to be close as i can to understand what my body needs as much as i can take my space since i have been no the one can take space i will clean my space and i will guard it because i have been there anyway i'm claiming my body and my space and i'm grounded and because i'm grounding my body then i will share it with you i will start with queer people and then so on and so on in order to spread love it's just me trying to be myself because i don't know what is why what is this that is me yeah i mean it's i think giving a talk is really it's really hard because there's so many threats as a presenter like you are faced by an audience they're you know you are aware of how much they're engaged or not which is unfortunately if it's all like we don't see the craziness of the others so much so maybe it's good but like for example in the real settings we see them so that's something and we have time i don't know how many you know minutes [Music] you know say everything i wanted and the notes so this is like you can only like you cannot make it better than what is prepared that's a pro you can do the presentation and achieve what you prepare but you cannot be better than that yeah or you think no that's that's the literally uh meaning of what entropy is in terms of physics you cannot be yeah uh yeah yeah that's interesting yeah you can increase like performance in general that you know if and even if it's like structural or structure improvisation you can you can't well there's something like magic happens i don't know that well what kind of mind is like magic but like it's better than what it was meant to be i don't know i mean but i don't know but like we have this conversation at some point i think like an installation of like when i start working with idiots because i come from dance like that's for everybody and five years ago as i work in the media then my dream was work with installation so they want once i started working installations then i realized okay this is harder so working with hardware is so so so hardworking so many things that just hardware um that way like actually like installations are like the opera or what i see is the classical art the installation in the space when we have the means to create a problem you can make it something that is blending different fields in a way that's the operating class before that's what how i see like installations and that's something i mean i still work with installation but it's more collectives like the city's collectives yeah so but i'm more interested right now dive in that art that's actually the place of yours that art you are and it's so for cheap you guys i mean practice speaking like technically that my let's say my thesis in my bachelor was uh i don't know it was a technology embodied somehow and then i tried to propose an installation but then one of the questions that i have in my research was like how much visual complexity how much storytelling uh technical complexity and something else anyway you need to that's very convincing but i think what i want to say is like hardware is hard harden is smart and you can fail but you know the computers won't perform better than what you expect i guess like if you make unity sit and you run it and it's better than actually this happens with generative art actually like you prepare a program and the computer does something it's like a formative thing and it's sometimes very different from what you predict or you're going to expect and that's nice but of course if you try to aim for a specific aesthetic like one line here and your colors there like often with a program it's very difficult and you can disappointed and i think that's the kind of way of like working as like what you picture as like really concretely and trying to do it with hardware or programming whatever the technological thing or even with a body that's just so because everything becomes stiff but if we just like say that we do something in the computer and we dance then like that's what we do in practice and that's really rich and also like you can become something that is more that's how we give agency what do you feel like agency that's nice micro performance and basically it's a similar way to say what we call in our concept elements uh it's basically how you keep agency for the agents that happens in the performance from his point of view uh was from a biological point of view but yeah so yeah anyway so i think i always say like so in my research for this like beginning because my the final work pieces for my bachelor is like one year the first six months i was like researching high-end images you know like working with yeah high in images but then after i realized that it was not necessary why because the medium is the message as a martial art says meaning that it's just the content i mean this is this is working towards content and that actually abuses i mean or utilizing in a functional way we dance in a 3d software you can do the other way around that's what we call about functionality you can have functional technology in the surface of dance say a simple example is that you use projection magnet to enhance the dance right that's functional and then you can have the other way around when you use the dance movements in a 3d software with a kinect because it's just nice data to create something that's functional what we do you know so we set ensure that best practices exist is a clear form of communication between technology and bodies with everything in between uh it's not that but also it's but it's also not functional um but it's hard no sorry that was good question but i think the problem is that art is not something like ideal thing but you need like physical thing to be [Music] functional you cannot just be well probably you can be an artist making strange campus that is not functional but what am i saying but there is something functional that supports the art to be [Music] this is flagship this is really we don't need the metaphysics and this is for real unfortunately so far so far so but i think [Music] think microsoft for making windows but it has to be there and that kind of has this queer discourse of technology and body in windows to [Music] make our life better or maybe it is i mean but i think windows has so many bugs that makes it somehow more organic no i don't know what i'm saying but we use tools you know what is cool actually somehow is that is like this is nonsense somehow like whatever criminals [Music] these things in like main mainstream festivals say that you know that or now here so i'm just wondering because like doesn't does this matter you know like i mean understand this in a positive way like others what do you mean that can be acknowledged i don't know all the the labor all the fun all the trouble uh what does it matter how like is it not meaningful but it doesn't matter not even me for not but is that something or not i think so but sorry to skip your question but i was just thinking like what is this festivals with all these things we said like because what if things are not functional like we go to an exhibition that has nonsense digital art that has nothing that interacts it just flickers but radius actually some people do that no but this i don't know how to there's like commerciality comes from is like what the white man is telling me to do somehow how me as a person that i grew up in colombia i assume also as the rest of us different places it's just life basically how it's being given to us that's normal nothing normal and because norman was not somehow giving me space to beat him then i have to find my own spaces and one of those spaces is the preference yeah yeah it's like a bit more concretely speaking like i was imagining like we try to create what we do in a way that people can understand for example we can practice this but we can't create it as a performance as well so that you can understand that it's highly we don't do that we do the practice we do the chat like we upload online we don't do installation we don't do a performance then no but it cannot be acknowledged because no one can you know break because festivals are you know like here you're now so high you gave us just one hour but not always you know we have to do this we have this stuff like two applications that people answer like really like what you guys do but we don't know what to do with it it happened like like it happened that we apply and they like it but they don't know how to show it what is that where is this a video i mean there is 140 hours of video so i don't know like i cannot select one video it's a framework that's why i think i will i will okay so then i will review what you said is uh it's funny like so the practice is not a performance but like to communicate with other people it is a performance but if you go to academic paper it's not a performance because the practice is the promise of something yet to come is not yet there the practice only is as dance itself that's as it only happens in the moment before and after there is just thoughts about dance videos whatever you want but this dance of the course an embodied experience so in that sense uh what we try to do is we're not working towards one last performance but it's just a practice it's the promise of something yet to come every time by practicing the best practices so for the communication we can you know maybe for the next additional view now we can say that we can performance but then i think that's kind of design problem or like you know marketing aspect of it but then what i'm interested is does it affect us how to approach the practice because now we're conscious that sometimes we break ourselves as a performance then it's no longer like a pure practice or can we still keep it as a pure practice we just just sometimes do like nonsense chat but we sell it as a [Music] but now we're working in the hybrid performance and now we're like probably doing people working in future labs electronica to keep developing this uh so yeah that's the performative aspect of it that's the practice right that's just what we call that the hybrid performance and i think we have to close soon so [Music] new [Music] from the vegetables [Music] and please visit our youtube my youtube channel and like the video and subscribe you can find it there to the main website that you will find somewhere oh yeah that's pretty bad if you work with website and you find your child yes [Music] start a little bit later okay so what i wanted to ask you and then you please uh i i was really um thinking about you questioning also the concept of festivals or the constant gatherings like this which i think is is also a very productive thought so you said at the beginning we were breathing then we you said i like if nobody says something so you have the prisoners who are sitting here programming competitions or sitting here so you have um suggestions how to you know create a festival where we have more experiment space or spaces you know because this is a very this is a very formal performance [Music] i mean like yeah for sure like first it's like as long as you can as long as the white man can give his face to the other one who is not white man gives face that's the first one i agree yeah uh yeah that's the first first step we have to do disabilities for bodies who cannot have space when i arrive in lincoln as electronic and then i realize after a while i do like this called interface cultures it's like the most experimental place [Music] and then i realized it was inspired to be done so i was really looking forward to seeing her work and then her work was so clean that it was like so working hard that i feel like oh my god she's being domesticated as i feel also now when i do my applications i just learned to behave in a white culture i moved to belgium 13 years ago so this is just life but anyway [Music] so justifying behaving in a white culture so also the concepts in the white culture are perhaps not really all fitting into cultures or into behavioral pencil patterns which which we would like to see perhaps is it something like that [Applause] before so like it's kind of related but i want to say it's like white or not and i think it's more about like for us what's important is that we have a space for failure and festivals they expect that everything is good in a way because that's why you invite speakers and artworks artists for artworks but the one experience we had was last year goes forward for digital arts and my role was to do art conference but that was like asked by the conference to do on conference and they asked me to do anything specific but they have made a playground with us in the mozilla house organic events doing performances random things and that was really nice because it like i was responsible but if there's like only like one two people came that's also okay because that and i it's not even a failure because sometimes it gives something that would not happen in a regular festival can happen in these spaces so like failure is actually not really a failure and i think there are ways to um afford these like spaces for like like american artists to experiment with this even in like this institutional frameworks and that's more about yeah i don't know how about you know i think we just needed more this force to make this happen i agree i mean failure culture be discussing this very often and especially in the context of funding there's not you know this kind of events or even projects are always funded so we need this this criteria failure culture which we discuss a lot but still not common both of you would you if you want would you want to make a close statement and then i have another question or sharing yeah but you said no so that's why i have like it wasn't [Music] i felt so uncomfortable and i really like have pressure and like i have to talk what i don't need to present but then after the talk i forgot this you know something to say and then i started doing another presentation and it's basically like a wiki that i have a bunch of information that i can talk and i just like go through and you know depends on my mood i construct the story on the fly so today it was even more experimental and i'm glad that people stayed here or maybe people are looking for the keynote but anything like people here and we like maybe what we said is kind of really nonsense but we do have like we do appreciate the media our culture culture and our knowledge reference and yeah i just want to make it better than you know like contribute like i'm not saying that you want to contribute that sometimes kind of sounds arrogant but we're trying not to and if you have any feedback please write in the document [Applause] so anybody else does anybody else have a question or a comment you want to say something but i failure how often do we have an hour [Music] she likes um yeah the idea of failure and she would like to include it in the spaces i think that was a very very important suggestion [Music] thank you very much both of you and it was great it was good thanks thank you thank you [Applause] okay so now our next and last guest is here and i just ask you have you ever seen the second moon [Music] but it's time to catch up we have some great support for this purpose because eliot hood is here with us he's a digital media artist technologist curator and educator for manchester with an academic background in physics elliot founded the fool-based art and designs studio kimchi and chips together with mini sao and they are known for discovering novel interactions between people media materials and exploring new technical and artistic paradigms and here we can and i'm really happy about that we can present a real world premiere after six years of development their installation another move celebrates its world 10 years at new now here the story behind it is at the foreign in japan you know why it didn't happen this digital monument another moon celebrates nothing less than the end of the coaling area era and it will be visible at night under clear skies the audio installation is built in the missionary path and i'm so excited and looking forward to catching inside so after [Music] i think five minutes and then we you can see attitudes on the stage and i will ask them one last question and then we look at another one have fun [Music] oh", "XCTcsZI6-Bw": "all right good morning good morning should we should we say like where are we now or we just talk no i think we can say where are we now now so we are in essen [Music] they were invited here for the conference as part of the festival new now the conference is called answer nice to see you again we just saw now two few days ago in our electronica he passed by just for one day and he disappeared it's hard to talk and we could do but i mean the camera is really weird that'll be funny to see like 9000 times faster there's a plate getting emptier so what are we doing today like not not for the camera but realistically so like work wise you could go like we come here to work you know so anyway so then officially i just checked the schedule then it's at six people are invited to come in and at seven is the the opening of the festival um and it goes until 1am with activities and some sound things and things so i think we should go to the center as yourself so we take some time like i go back to the room then take some time to rest a little bit also because i woke so at some point we just left the hotel and i think we should go and find a lunch in the city and then be back here maximum four or five i think yeah that's what i think what do you think then we cannot do a chat we do a track in the center yeah yeah we should do one i mean you can move it you can show that wait i'm gonna see the preview i don't know it's too bright it's not that crazy but you get it and we can have a chat with the bird statues [Music] so nice i don't have to cook breakfast finally you don't have to sleep with two other guys yeah we talked about it yesterday but it's the first time we don't stay in the same room like node was like were sleeping next to each other and that was absolutely that was the first time that we were sharing space i don't know about ukraine but then it's basically like japanese right so that was the bank but that was good in the famous flood with bruno with a dog [Laughter] [Music] what is wrong with this dog i really hate it but i think the guy was also like he understood and also when you were trying to hug him it was a bit strange situation but no but i mean we couldn't complain it was really because it was good and it was really cheap probably pain and the woman and the whale she was nice was super super easy going so thanks hilde that was her name thanks i really appreciate your meals now in a hotel [Music] and my room has a picture of a guy a mining guy who is looking at me all the time it's a bit bizarre and i don't have a fridge no also but i don't have that texture and the goodies oh yeah and then i have like [Music] now it's more quiet there are a lot of people maybe just the business people just went to work yeah i guess so it doesn't make sense now like now it's 9 30 so already you have meetings yeah hi [Music] the beer is like middle of nowhere maybe they drive that little car maybe maybe five of these executives they just have one smart car they're like once they go out like they're like stuck in space but they're very ecological and friendly they the five of them is even one smart car maybe they have the driver but it's a smart what we do in the city there's not much i can't imagine maybe people in the city will tell you go to the mine [Laughter] do you know this place but i'm happy that we finished this video because that was in my head and my two years still oh yeah you're stranded though yeah yeah it would be you to submit uh to gifts for kim kim if you're seeing also hello i know you're not watching anyway politically just we say hello to everyone so kim invited me we saw kim in the impose and then she has this project running in milwaukee uh what is about which is about work so then she invited me to submit any sort of artificial proposal around work so we just render very structurally i think the easiest way is like i took in my archive the latest video and then i test it i render it at 9000 times faster and kind of like it and then i just did it with the next four uh in the same in descent order so from the latest one to the yeah and now we have six minutes preview that we can submit as an audio proposal also for fiber festival what is this five year festival this is so it is so for the camera please explain what it is and share with us whatever inspires you it's a festival in amsterdam sorry i'm not really good at camera well it's like a friends of no but then what's known we have to explain plain language really the node is the institute for node programming based languages they try to promote themselves like the institute for no programming languages so that's why as an institute so that's why they provide informal information in dvd designer and that's it but then the node instance will also have this festival which will move apart sleeping next to each other when you're just mad uh a real person there is also no as like foreign 20 because i think i heard like every time they like brand as like note 4 but i feel like they didn't use that word that's not form but they said like note 20 hashtag anyways fiber is like social festival like biannual exhibition ccl [Music] is is it somehow connected with the comicon pony cliff university from amsterdam no idea i didn't hear that name i actually don't know what's running what what is the entity where the money comes from because node was like i know like you know the team like mostly volunteers i guess and then north institute but you know one of the most important things of the node festival is the workshops so they run the conferences but also the workshops are really important actually for the note for the bbb community that's a really big moment when the video community meds and actually that community is a very interesting community it's a very interesting project yeah but it's so not easy to get into like this before because why they did workshops because it's low level computing so designer is more high level computing you don't have to go to anything to that so it takes a bit more time to get to know i mean you can use patches which i mean that's the the the beauty of these node programming languages is you have patches and based on that you can alter your own patches and create something right but if you want to use it more in a function i mean say we want to use it for installation so work with sensors and things like this then you really need to start diving into the software itself or just hard coding things in c i think is c plus plus at the core so now c plus by the way what is a computer what is that [Music] yeah c plus plus i think maybe c sharp i don't know they move to that.net kind of you know unity kind of thing because now the vehicle yeah no but that's that's a library that's just a library that is integrated yeah but like they built on top of like uh this library or framework so it became more modular than because it also uses a game engine and somehow it's multiple i don't know what it means anyway so as you see we don't work with dvd i did a bit but i mean i did also a bit so anyways i would use search designer if i need to do something similar so that was a explanation fighter festival that was weird the driver doesn't have this workshop really it's more it's more like the festival but there was an open calling for fire to submit outdoor visual proposals right is it i mean it is still open the one where something too bad next time i think the festival is like trying to push this kind of political critical aspect of media art like the conference in the world like i mean this is a movement so this is interesting yesterday we already were mentioning this what this is like for reason but they were portraying more you know is more i mean from things that i saw and i watched almost all of them they were portraying more than art and science aspects of so the art and science aspect of the artistic practice more than the art and media practice and i was sharing now to the just now that i'm back from arsenal i finally understand the difference between art and science and art and media before i was confused with this so maybe art and science of the four is science based so hard for science based so it will uses the triangle the language always will be scientific so they will have scientific approach with it and then also then there are specific sides of it but then the media one is the one who i will dare to set it more close to the sign in a way or speculative design where the media is being used in conjunction with art to speculate so in that sense it doesn't have to be necessary uh useful somehow or clean and that's that's that's that's a different because for instance in arts electronica so you have the johan kepler university jacob yeah that's the main university whereas electronic capacity and there are art and science right so they would show all these robotics all these crazy things they use a lot of budget for developing but also you have the constant university of lynx the the university of arts and leans and then they have different careers from my experience there i thought like the career that is the most experimental in the constant research project there was a project we were showing us electronica he's studying that so what but what i was trying to say is like even though so the most speculative approach that i could have [Music] and then the interface cultures the approach is very design-wise it has this clean approach to web design functionality development [Music] why because then it becomes too clean like the aspect of it like it's just clean it's or somebody working web design it has to be super well designed somehow even though it's bad and then in vr and different aspects it's just well done yeah oh i think it's also that that school and also electronica was kind of at least it used to be or is still the epicenter of media art i wouldn't say art no no but that's what i mean that's what i was trying to clarify because that's not true so i thought i'll do the same but they they are the people so they're the most visible thing that you can heard about art and put it other creative things um but in reality is that the focus of activity arts electronica is not media but it's just i mean their motto is like i think society technology and something else so they are really trying to make the life better to what i want to say is it used to be like i feel that how they started and how this aesthetics are formed is from them well or at least they are part of this you know clean media art aesthetic and i wouldn't say it's art and media because it i think it's something is like media art because it's blended but art and science there's no science art or art science because it's well that's something else but i record media art but you can say it are the media whatever but i think they are kind of you know they formed it like that and then since they got the budget and they grew they switched to art and science that's my understanding i might be wrong but but at least like they are the crowd that like really this interface culture or this thing yeah emerged from i think and then now it's still there right like if you see like for example like create creative applications.net is like a good example like you have to have like a really clean aesthetics you know to be honest and i understand in terms of communication and visibility because if you have to share a project with a a crowd that doesn't really have the knowledge to yeah yeah i think it's just easier to communicate when things are i guess well designed somehow yeah of course it's a good entry point i mean that's why in a way that's why you have like best practices of so many things basically because then through design methodologies you just make things easier like there is this book of designers very well known school like don't make me think there are many many of these sort of uh like the design at the core of what i learned from school also like china the court is it assumes that the user doesn't know anything so it's just straightforward so yeah it goes in that direction [Music] but so and that so then we agree on that but then if you really will try to go then it's in the state of the art of media art then then you have to question like more like the um it's more like an ontological conversation of of media where then the user is is not taking us as a recipient like as an empty recipient we just take something functionally but i think it has to be more engaged and as we do in the in our process i think we should give back agency to the user so not you offering a tool box but is actually finding ways how to circumvent his functionality and give back agency for the user to decide what to do with something but that and and that still we are talking about media arts so that's what i meant that is it's an ontological understanding of the media so it's a bit like packing the youtube not the user's side [Music] as a user it's not that i have to do this way and that way but i can do something wrong yeah that's that there has to be an accordance to be hacked yeah i would say more like to be hacked yeah yeah yeah not to act but to be hacked yeah yeah and that's an ontological process because i'm not so interested in the epistemological process which is just like the really knowledge base thing like to really just understanding that but more than ontological process of life through being within the process then you basically let yourself be hacked [Music] there's this i think it's a kind of famous quote online that when a programmer or debugger or this qa quality anyway it's like someone debugging goes to a bar and order one beer and then another one debugger comes and order minus one beer and then orders like two million i don't know what's the maximum of int or one more than that and then they make sure that it works the bargainer can handle it and then the real customer comes in and asks for a bathroom and then the whole thing crashes because that's not something that's expected to happen okay [Music] that's the other way around for programmers you know they're kind of afraid of the the users because users do things wrong yeah yeah this is the other way right it's kind of funny yeah yeah because i think is that i'm proposing what i'm smoking you're speaking about that is i think what we practice in the framework the best practices is that i first do it for myself meaning that if myself as programmer don't want to get in the stress of oh my god i don't know i don't want the user to do these things right you cannot control everything so as you said that you can be afraid that the user will find a bug so instead of going in that direction that is that's an entropy basically that's intimidating then i think it's more interesting or i'm more interested in them in find a framework where i can actually uh use the possibility of mistake as some element elements that i can use in my world yeah i totally agree maybe that's another head the user asking for the bathroom but it's like i would say it's not an end because it's a pause like i think in optimal conditions like the program should be still running so then i will say it should be a pulsar it should not crash the system it shouldn't just close a loop and then go to one else statement yeah no i set more like an option and i said because that's the conference theme but maybe as users we are always trying to do it in the right way but something else leads to another end i don't know i think i don't know but i think i don't give any love no i'm just trying to make a connection okay because if you say another end is possible probably we have to do something different yeah and maybe that's the user doing the wrong thing can lead to i'm here at the end yeah okay yes yeah yeah yeah but it's very vague no but then like it doesn't matter because we don't have to we don't have to know about what is it so that's what i'm saying is not about epistemology which is about knowledge but it's about ontological so it's actually to give space is just keep a framework for the elements to be and do what they need to do without knowing what is it that's what i i i underline the ontological there so in in the context of the and another ends possible then and then i think is that it's actually just give space for the glitch to happen and then yeah the error and then just acknowledging the error as something positive or not necessarily positive but as something or even maybe i would dare to say like maybe at the beginning you can until you have this mindset that is twisting you have to acknowledge that something that is possibly people get scared of things that they don't know people that they don't know things that are not familiar to them because we are training or we grow up thinking getting used to yeah when we are confronted we think that we don't know we get scared and then back off so i think it's like a strategy to find spaces not only media art but it's just as humans basically [Music] and reclaiming space for ourselves basically i think you can maybe go more into that direction more political but and i think that what we need as humans is to find space to be humans because we cannot we are not humans that's what that means practice we favor the most human because you're trying to get away from taxonomical assumptions and constraints individuality constraints more in favor of uh multi-universe multiverse like the possibility to not be only one thing and i think that could be or a strategy could be the glitch that they would reach the error i don't like to use quantum mechanics as a metaphor but it's like all these possibilities are i mean coexisting it's not that something is here but this possibility of this being here like 50 but also this possibility of this thing here 30 it's more distributed [Music] i think this is the reason why art and science don't go together because always art site art excites science in the wrong way it cannot be cited in the right way no because then if you cite science in the right way that is science it's not the art yes yes but then what about what what about the other way around can you decide art in science in the proper way i think i think in neuroscience it happens but other fields i think it's very difficult but then it goes close to this design because basically when we talk about art like or creativity say then you have a liberal creativity and apply currency so then when you put example of the science it uses creativity to not call it art then it becomes applied yeah hope you applied yeah so on that design by definition no but i think in neuroscience this is possible because neuroscience itself is really not well defined in a way and they kind of try not to have like really um simple methodology like some sometimes it cannot be logical yeah because drains are so fluid yeah and then we cannot just find the walls with that also because like yeah that's the important part okay that's what i mean like so okay so that makes sense like that's why in a way speculative because they think they know less than five percent comparing to i don't know uh hearts or other uh body parts so by the brains like just i don't know how much they know but i think it's less than 10 um so then basically their approach is speculative at the core like we guess we're thinking it's my word like this what are we saying yeah so the art inside i feel this is like a mixed theme for us to talk about art and science so thank you for the ph thank you for the phd daniella but i'm not gonna do it i'm sorry no no no no no phd there's a big application that says how wrong our science is just to explain that in your proposal and this is just a personal opinion i mean we just speak i just speak from my food we have this conversation in vienna like we with uh i'm speaking from my food so this is my my my truth and this this is what i believe but it's there's no means it's a way to patronize somebody with mind knowledge it's just about experience it's true for me i often forget that it's good that you said it because sometimes people really try to convince you right because they assume that you're trying to convince them your position we are saying all these things from our standpoint and we are not well it might sound but it's not that our job is to convince people that our science is wrong or something but it's it's just about saying our opinion is but some people take it in a different way but i remember like i remember like when like now it's more clear so i'm not gonna do that thing now the phd now but then maybe maybe the new now when once once i found another end possible another possible end so like uh thank you anila but i'm not gonna do the phd video later yes not now but we should host unconference during this festival called knock down not now could be interesting and then we can just talk constantly with [Music] other people okay thank you for watching thank you for people subscribing once in a while it's uh it's my motivation to keep this doing okay thank you and see you later", "jksxNKJe3Uc": "great so hello everyone hello everyone welcome back to same place not the same time i mean yes the same time for you guys i guess right i don't know i guess it should be i mean every day someone's you know reloading the channel at the same time oh there's no video today i'm so confused because i'm just you know i have in my to do i i just opened many tabs since the last time uh i met you i was yeah let's say for one week ago i opened different tabs and open githubs and different things so i have i didn't close anything because i said like i put it in my to-do list like to sort out these things so every time i just try to see like i have like literally like 30 at least 30 taps in three different i have running two chromes and one safari and i don't know it's so confusing man i never keep tabs come on yeah i put everything in my note i don't use bookmarks i don't keep open tabs so what do you do then how you do how you just copy the link i just copy link to my note notepad kind of app and then you have everything the yeah things that you are like yeah it's not really organized it's really cluttered but okay okay i'm just trying like that's one of the things that i will have this small conversation with joe i was like but yeah but i learned very very early when i started uh learning about let's say computer science in a way it was like one of the most difficult things to do in a way is like to find is to basically how to structure your own way right yeah like folders and copy you know how to because it has to make sense for you right yeah i think joe is here hey yo can you hear us yes hello [Music] hello ayo is there hello nice to meet you so yeah we are in brussels joyce in anthrop right now i think yeah yeah so yeah so i think we look japan at the moment i mean so everyone's kind of close to each other i think so we don't we so we don't introduce when we do this chat we try to not really introduce the people to say like who is joe who is uh so you just try to you can try a different way but i think it will be weird i was so i want i wanted to propose because i proposed my two friends uh which i literally you guys are in my right side and in my left side right now so i propose to to these beautiful entities today like i propose today like to kind of like talk around starting from a text that i found in arts electronica that i found very interesting to maybe share and to start the conversation from there so if you guys are okay with maybe it could be interesting just to uh read the text it's very short i just read it like in two minutes so maybe just uh maybe just read it out loud and then from there we can actually the people also can just follow along the conversation is that okay with you guys please read it i can't read i have it i mean i needed to get it i was prepared so what we're really all together no i think that will take an hour my god i have like morning tabs together open i guess we can just switch like like for the for each paragraph maybe yeah that sounds good yeah maybe somebody can start because like now i can okay i found it okay department of interface cultures faculty by christa manuela fabrizio la mancha davide hello [Music] contemporary artists designers and inventors are creating new connections and systems exploring how silicon organic and even speculatively alien forms of life are entangling mutating evolving what can these new entities and relationships look like are they french friendships and collaboration or competitions and conflicts for these new exchanges we need new languages programmable aesthetic interspecies non-human and post-scientific the emerging hybrids and cyborg entities join and celebrate shamanistic and non-verbal traditions hidden cultures with magical symbols energies and fictions the culture or even a cult of symbiosis is is required a fusion between old and new ways of dealing with reality we call to disrupt and diseng engage from the destructive non-profit oriented technologies and systems which are based on oppression manipulation and quantification for survival in the future viability of life on our goldilocks zone planets we believe that less anthropocentric knowledge systems must arise and that more caring technologies are required okay then i think observing how contemporary tools often contain the traces of past tradition traditions and knowledge we wonder what was happened to the wisdom that was left behind the logic of the all encompassing scientific method upon which most contemporary technologies are grounded overshadows non-scientific non-quantifiable hybrid or alien expertise and skills from non-dominant cultures as a consequence the ancient folkloric pre-industrial strategies to enhance and foster life and to comfort and confront the challenges of the future do not find enough space in the modern cultures of a faultless digital digitalization as ai becomes ubiquitous and more than just a buzzword it starts to affect our daily lives and artistic practices we need to have forensic look at the beliefs behind the new tools and create and creative techniques engendered by the cools of technology one approach is to fully embrace and test the aesthetic capabilities of quasi-unlimited combinations and database driven creation [Music] another is to investigate and measure and then i have to take a newly uh to measure the social impact and to interrogate the role we are seeing to assign to our technology and to creativity as a whole creative thinkers and artists want to look behind the curtain and unveil what is hidden beneath the layers of ai machine learning automation and surveillance technologies like the theft the detectives or inspectors they question the black box to discover how and why these intelligence systems make certain decisions what these decisions mean and for whom they are fundamentally being made students of interface cultures have developed works which combine current technologies with ancient humanistic and esoteric practices delving into topics such as divination twirlings subconscious unconscious secrets rituals leisures energies contemplation as well as cults both old and new credits blah blah blah so yes so uh maybe just like a shortcut around the context so this is um i don't know what if you can give me uh permission to share my screen wait a second yeah you can share things yeah uh sure uh desktop one two one this one no desktop two this one yeah so this comes from you guys can see this or no yes yeah yes it is right so this comes from a framework in arts electronica uh where you all myself we are presenting or working in tweaks and is within a framework of the school uh the interface called uh the department of the interface cultures which you uh is studying right now i think um so and and they did this is like the framework of how they frame that and then they put a individual works and but i found interesting that i have this conversation with uh with daniella danila is one of the person that i met through uli that is somebody that i work in seeds um and she was i was referring to her i'm gonna be nice electronically as med there and like she's uh involved in this leonardo network this art and science network and very much uh i guess like more related with uh signs than other things right so art and science more really to signs uh or yeah these kind of things hardcore sign let's say and maybe i can stop uh or so um what she was saying that i thought was interesting was she said like they around us electronic because i haven't been there before so she said around arsene electronica what she found very interesting is not what really happens in the mainstream or like the big price what is called i think the price of arts electronica but around other things and i think in the framework that we go uh it is within the school is somehow it seems to me i feel it's kind of uh kind of like a space where in a way kind of try to hacks the mainstream or is trying to not be maybe so normative uh as the main framework i will say uh that's the way i see it and i make so much assumptions also in relation to what we experience without in the impulse than that and i doubt the e i make some uh some parallel in the sense like it's not the main thing that is happening but because the main apparatus is happening it gives the possibility for other frameworks to happen and use the money from the main format right uh yeah [Music] maybe i can stop uh sharing my screen and that's and what i found very interesting is like so that she that has been there a few times and she's more involved with these things she see it as a as more interesting things around than the main thing um because there is more experimentation possible or not selected and more research based yeah what i found like i think from what i kind of feel from the text i was very excited when i when i read the text you know because i read sometimes other i was following electronica trying to see for in which context we were working with yo because it was not clear so and then so from time to time i was reading from arts electronic stuff but they are very uh sign based or like you know very functional let's say not only like that yeah design-wise scientific why like very measurable the question there there are some professors in interface cultures that have disappeared as from axe electronica that they they much link with uh industry and they show that artists can make the fut a better future this is the the biggest team in arks electronica and that's how they also get the funding uh i think because big industries then are interested in artists that they can use but then the site project sites interest and the more scientific approach art artistic scientific approach combination is more interesting and um because the paris electronica is also linked with a university and it was um more squad squatted uh like squatter based uh artist run in the beginning and there's still uh an anarchist radio kind of uh radio fall and uh yeah so the this the spirit how it started is is more i think what we are also had more experiments and um in the in the question questioning uh if we can make a big better future uh more than um yeah what i found very very very interesting is like we speak we spoke with now that something like we said like is there the question but for the sake of questioning we use that sometimes in a conversation like we are not questioning for the sake of really get an answer from that but it's just for the sake of questioning and more like with the idea i guess this is how i feel it to be in a framework that allows you to experience something that for some reason you are curious about not necessarily you need to make it better the uncertainty um with your projects yeah i don't know like i can't really say anything about arsenal because i'm not really connected to it but like what i've been like following is basically like they had you know like so many issues in the past years and there was like movement like kiss my arse these uh issues with you know like all the gender and such so i think it's i see that uh like when i see the juries like they're trying to change it in the you know last few years and i think that's a good movement but at the same time it feels like you know they're trying to have this kind of role model in this whole media art industry because that industry or the i mean you know the discipline because ours is the you know the biggest festival in this field so i i see that it's trying to you know not to find an answer but try to be something that can represent and that's like really functional that's like just my impression i don't know anyone from there so i cannot really judge anything but from outside that's how i feel about the festival yeah but i think what i tried to because i completely understand i mean but we just came from like the impulse that we were just in austria and the impulsion is like maybe the main like the biggest festival also the contemporary dance and or more recognized so in that sense the impulse dance is alike to the arts electronica for dance right and the state of the art of dance and both are i don't understand why both are why both are happening in austria how come they both are happening in upstream that's very strange but what i'm trying to say with this is like i'm trying to uh say like i'm not i'm trying to like bypass the political aspects of it you know like it's not my my intention i'm not really interested right now and start criticizing what uh politics let's say um but what i think is interesting like for instance from the text i see that uh something at some point they were saying this at some point they were referring to how contemporary tools often contain the traces of past traditions and knowledge so we wonder what what what has happened to the wisdom that was left behind and that's something i found very interesting like the logic of the old encompassing scientific method upon which most contemporary technologies are grounded overshadows non-scientific non-qualif or quantifiable hybrid or alien expertise and skills from non-dominant cultures as a consequence the ancient foreclosure pre-industrial strategies to enhance and foster life and to confront the challenges of the future do not find enough space in the modern cultures of a faultless digitalization i found that very very interesting for me coming from a mixer culture like south america with uh uh like colonize a country where all this ancient uh uh knowledge was left behind in order just to let the western take over and yeah with a colonization process i don't know how you guys see this uh this like this that uh this paragraph you see but um i found very interesting that all these um because it's acknowledged somehow yeah the knowledge and uh that media we we also have a course called [Music] that media and then we it's um we don't remember the professor but he has a database with all media that is that but questioning that media if you can show that they are somewhere or they are in the story they are not so dead anymore so then you can think like you can fantasize what was and that's also stimulating for um rethinking the future [Music] that helps well for me yeah uh i know like from this uh works uh i kind of a little bit uh you know aware of what you are doing you two are doing but also um i know hess he's doing this cnc punch needle machine and we had a conversation about um his work and how for example like weaving um like often people talk about that you know like that's the ancient computer like this uh jacquard weaving that has this punch card that became the you know the media for the first programming like you know the program programmed uh code is uh becomes a punch card and then the computer reads that code so like that's something like especially like what uh with with regard to the paragraph uh you mentioned i think that's something relates to like old let's say old technology and digital or computers um but at the same time like i when i see these um analogies it always makes me feel so like not uncomfortable but something bit weird about this really like in a way it's like really representative like this punch card this computer and that's like so connected and it's like i feel like there's nothing you can just talk about it anymore because it's so obvious and it's it's the same thing in a way like you don't have to even talk about like that i'm a human um you know like if if they are from the same origin and you know um but then i think it's it becomes more interesting when you actually like take that old well let's say the history of computer for example and see like not just to see like what the transition was but maybe bring that into the modern technology again so in his case it's not weaving but with this punch machine i don't exactly know how it works but um with this uh i guess it's something like he's using like 3d printer kind of equipment and i found it's really interesting when you know like it's kind of reviving what was there with like modern technology and then something happens i don't know like maybe like someone can elaborate because what happened you mean [Music] you mean something still needs to happen with it yeah like it's just like it's more like kind of for me like disturbing the history you know like what was there and like that that's obvious everyone knows it i mean you can you know still study like history but then as an artist it's more interesting to disturb what was there and then reinterpret it or interpret it in the wrong way and see what's going to happen and maybe that's the way we can also relate to the past with both your practice together um i think you you're not busy with that media um and also not nostalgia they're there but it's uh more exp experiment in things that uh are not yet there so um and that's very vulnerable and nice to um to show that's my view on it it's not it's not related with an old media it's something that um the space is is um being experimented with but by you like it's a new space you you are making and i think that's i i i think that's the space where we call queer right like i mean i have been reading start reading a new queer a new take on andorra's hard way cyber manifesto there is a new take of somebody else that i don't remember exactly the name right now but it's uh carl from the from brussels from my dog dee he started reading some book that is called the thing is called money feminism manifesto thing is called and it's uh no glitch is called glitch feminist manifesto and it's quite interesting what i'm what i'm trying to lead into the conversation is the idea basically that uh and think on something that is not yet established somehow um and think more towards the future um you have to reimagine some to try to think uh of something that it doesn't exist right like in in our conceptualization we call this like the the end of the world as we know it somehow or post-humanism we have different way to talk about this topic but in a way it goes around the idea of queries and like or the misfit or what is not fitting but in the way how i see it the way how we approach it is opening up space so sorry opening up new space like for vulnerability and [Music] hacking spaces like i think a hacking space is one of this uh way of trying to hacking institutional spaces for instance let's say in the impulse then we were we were hacking uh the space and when the previous uh chat we uh we were talking with uli even on the previous one and we were kind of like clarifying like you know we're saying that the hacking she was using the words that i like very much the hacking is related more to adding uh instead of like subtracting um that's the way how she was uh referring to it writing new space yeah realities like with donna haraway also to also push it like to have more stories different kind of stories different kind of realities um i uh which is manifesto i was um actually with a project exciting research with jorge you also are in it um sebastian springer he is also students from interface cultures he uh he wanted to make the manual for the moody and i gave them some text and i can share my screen and show it [Music] it's also in that sense related um it's in the manifesto style of donna harroway and it's now in english deutsch in netherlands um [Music] and he he added some things like love the as part of exciting research moody excitement calculator 2.0 is an attempt to disclose love energies shared between people so this is um [Music] i think i hope to establish also together a more [Music] queer safe space with it and that's uh i think yeah something that i found very interesting in joe's approach is that that i mean the joe has like i think at the core joe is like an inventor so he's like i think without noticing always he's like just inventing things right so like it's who is at the core is really searching to this future so there's an idea of utopia somehow and therefore he just started building things that somehow maybe might be not be useful or who i mean i don't think you're really thinking and how useful is this or not but i think it just the opens possibility for things to happen that you don't know maybe when you're building that but just on the on the natural process of the project things will come up naturally to become something um or at least that's the way we experience uh the path that we were with the 2.0 the moody because the project started before when he's created the first version of this and then the path that i have been with joe then i there were so many things that just come [Music] during the process basically how you can rethink um what does it means like basically that like measure the energies between people right um and it goes around this idea of a speculation very much i think at the core is the speculation and futurism which i think is very valid in these days and is this like supposed to be printed as an instrument this will be printed yeah and then uh like a manual as a in the pharmacy shop or in gadgets shop you get this manual yes and yeah to to really say that it's open for interpretation to use it and [Music] to make the research open source in that sense i think this is something very interesting that we thought we uh touched with now auto in our practices like i see the relation in the idea that you're not telling actually the user what is that for but it's more actually it's give it gives back agency to the user of the audience trying to tell is more reflecting like you tell me what is this interesting or what is this for more than me telling you from a knowledgeable position like this is what i know and this is for and and i think that's very interesting not saying like what do i know but just actually create a framework to make people reflect upon that and open the conversation and stimulate the conversation around things that we don't know and to share it uncertainty yeah i think that's like the reason why like i'm like always reluctant to work with like mocap like motion capture for example or kinect um because it's so direct that you know that if you raise your arm it shows you know the skeleton that's moving like that and uh at one point i was really into working with um eeg like brainwaves electro ah i forgot what it stands for but or even like emg because it's really i mean emg is more um let's say functional because you bend your arm and from the muscles you can see the peaks so you can relate to the movement but eeg is so it's so bad that with the like a cheap sensor it's not pretty cheap like 200 or 300 bucks like you don't really get anything from it um but that's i found it's that's a really interesting part you can also like decide you can go to like really scientific direction that you can understand um what is happening uh the the effect is really subtle like if you have like alpha wave or not depending on you know your eyes are closed or not but also you can use it just as a noise generator like really non-scientific way to use it and that's really it's really up to the the user and also you know like how much you explain to the audience for example if it's a performance and you hear wearing it you can really fake it for example like i don't want to say fake but you know some people do that actually in the performance that they actually wear the sensor but like maybe they manipulate the data i'm not saying that i did it before but um that's possible but also you can you know really explain what is happening in a scientific way and then try to do it maybe it works it doesn't work actually there's an interesting artist uh alan pearlman she did this uh performance with eeg and like eeg opera brainwave opera or something like she names and actually she um the dancers she works with they i don't know one person maybe she actually trained like tai chi or something that she can actually like have control of the brain waves like from like meditation or something and that's actually picked up by the sensors and that affects the visual and sound which is really like that that itself is i think it's really amazing but as an audience it doesn't matter if it's scripted or not or if it's from the sensor um but i think here there is like two two things around technology then maybe i like to then discuss with you guys like one thing is like and we talked with this in the past but now too is that you know when you work with technology then you have one approach that is in a way functional then when you basically and i think that can create things that can uh make complex as in areas where if you are really depending on technology because you know what are you expecting from the technology say it in a simple example in dance if you are mapping something so then you know that the function of the projector is to map so you know it's very clear what is the technology there for um then if something goes wrong with the projector then the whole piece gets compromised because it's really relying completely on the technology so this is one way to approach technology but in the other hand i think also uh you can have an approach where is more related to the glitch basically when you acknowledge the error and instead of like trying to go for an exact or like a really good functional way to approach something then you assume what other things might happen knowing that technology is very uh unreliable many times right um and i'm more interested in the second part like and we have been discussing this sometimes is uh how to in a way uh yeah instead of like hiding uh these errors then just how basically share the uncertainty of the things that we don't know basically yeah so then yeah it's more acknowledging i think the error i think uh this thing that i'm trying to share somehow um i think i found more interesting and it gives gives space we have this conversation but now when i was in greece we have this reading about people that so then there was some some people were interviewed about some pieces that were using technology they came up to the same places where they were basically judging the dance piece uh as functional or not functional because the technology was working more or less right but i think when in the in the dance piece let's say you take the error if you are working with technology and you take the error as a fundamental element within what you're doing then that gives possibility for different interpretations that is not only my interpretation as choreographer and telling the people this is it but it's more acknowledging that i have an intention so somewhat i'm competent to share something that i'm doing but the same time that i'm basically sharing or being vulnerable and giving a space for the other ones to just interpret what is happening if something is not working this uh what does uh moody do actually like i kind of know but i don't exactly know or is it even defined what's in the moody how does it work how or like what does it do like yeah like like more like stupid question what is it for what's the application so um it's a jewelry that you hang on your ear and it measures your temperature of the ear constantly and with that uh you have the fluctuations in excitement of yourself and it then it it shows it's directly with the light on the other side of the ear it shows it's via color from no excitement to high excitement all colors of the rainbow and then the color meanings are more esoteric signs but uh yeah it's a lot um also to do with the placebo like the placebo is um it's something that only works if you believe in it like with homeopathy also and with the moody it's also a bit like this and what the meaning is of the colors or what the now the the research goes further that you also can measure the distances between each other so with that we we can visualize the energies between people and but what what that means that uh is still open uh for the people who gonna wear it and um will give meaning to it so in that sense um showing our vulnerability of the not knowing uh so being totally not scientific in that sense no conclusions only uncertainties uh but also the vulnerability of the people who gonna wear it and uh making uh yeah making more aware that you are fluctuating person yeah and i think there's something that i can add that i see also in in arts like when they put uh because i think they just like they're really they minimize like the the text and i think they did a good job in let's say what it does and um mentioned also they like to discuss basically the politics of uh or you know what does it means to like surveillance things because basically what you're doing in the other and one in in in one hand also is the you are capturing the data so you agree towards for somebody for for us to capture the data and then with the data we do something around that so then it opens also the possibility for the dialogue what does that mean actually you know like then your data is being exposed as joe was saying and you're being vulnerable for other people to see how excited are you maybe that's something you can tell from the face or you know sweating or you know these little things that like sometimes like always you know sometimes always i don't know um question you know like these privacy issues or whatever but then maybe that's already existing like in this case like actually yeah like especially like when i was working with eeg like but you can actually tell it from your you know face if you're kind of relaxed or nervous or maybe it's even better than how eeg performs actually yeah also the thing is with all these technologies like the eeg now this this device we invite yeah i invented myself and and with a certain believe it it works but as a scientific company uh like who invents these things they also say we did that it's not really proven you cannot really prove anything they they are aware of that it's in that sense not really working yet for scientific use but as artists we can definitely use it and play with it and maybe help them in that way but it's not necessary and it's not um it's not what we it's not the goal you know the main goal of that let's say yeah but that's true like i remember we were like yesterday when we were researching okay who are the companies who are working with these things and and then you can see that basically with all in one hand also this is super cold when you have like this scientific uh you're trying to measure these kind of things and you're doing a scientific way then you have this very functional approach which is very cold because it has to just find uh structures a way how to collect this data and then to do something with it so they have this very straightforward uh way of collecting a lot of data but there is not too much space to actually question what does that mean you see it and and then just and at the end it will become something but then even they they will say like this is not completely i mean there they will say but just joseph right um but what i think i'm trying to mention here that i would like maybe to talk about it is like um i think what's interesting is the gesture is the gesture of trying to uh basically interpret what does that what does it mean that the color changes and let's say we say that that means that you are excited so i'm more interested in the gesture that in the concretization somehow of what it happens with it [Music] yeah by um by experiencing it's and and practicing like with your practice um it's about make by doing it and making a language or and sharing this language also very important to make it a language yeah and if like for our practice like in a way it's so meaningless or we just do whatever but then this what you said you know the gesture becomes you know the language and we that's why we did this chat to talk about it so that you know maybe when we're practicing it's maybe it's nothing but then if we analyze it it's it is something and then we just repeat it and it becomes actually something now at this point although it was not something to be it was not something that was planned from the beginning i think that's something that i because when the last speak when i met you then we were talking and i was reflecting upon this i think one of the reasons why in a way it works what we do with naoto is because there is this there is the uh insistence on the format basically so then is because we have an insistence to meet one time per week and over and over and over as naoto said after a while it will start making sense from nowhere because there is no really intention to do something with it yeah that's why like i'm interested in like wearables like your work or like anytime like what happens if you wear it for like one year or maybe like 10 years and then does it really like does it change something and actually like i want to talk about this um friends research i really liked basically he did um with himself and his partner they wear this smartwatch that he programmed so that it sends the like acceleration data like like really like just like amplitude of the last 10 seconds or something and send it to his partner or his partner's data is sent to him and then it's like encoded as like vibration like very simple like so basically if i'm moving a lot then maybe her watch vibrates more frequent something like that but then it starts to like build some kind of sense between them so if actually he was wearing it on his um um feet or you know uncle no what's what's the anyways and then like so when he's walking his partner knows that he's like and if it's like afternoon like late afternoon then he's coming home or something like that it kind of it's really basic data but start to make sense or like maybe it's just like sitting from a desk and just moving his plane displayed yeah i mean that's amazing because it for me like that's the whole idea of like that's the difference between like a tool and technology right like the technology as such is more a tool is something that is functional right so a tool works or it doesn't work if you really go like literally in programming a function it will work and it will not work it will not run the program if it's not good so it's binary in that sense like but a technology is something more that's created for other ones actually to like many of the technologies that we have there they were not invented with the purpose that we have including the internet so it's more i'm making the relation to what you said like so they didn't know why but so then you start finding it becomes a technology because then okay now i understand she's coming home now so the technology is there the the new like the food tourism the queer the queerness is in there right yeah like you add with this technology you add a social uh thing and that that makes it uh i think more queer like i i also think um you have in japan you have this uh mixed reality lab do you know it which group right who's working it's like what is um the adrian he's an inventor in japan and he [Music] made like a ring also to connect two people from a distance and you can um [Music] you can uh push the ring i can show you wait and you maybe share also the link in the chat like and then we try to also share these links with the people in youtube afterwards for the people to follow also afterwards reality love ring and then you have this mini hack ring for remote communication and this that you have a [Music] ring connected with social network internet and um yeah it gives signals to each other so you can like virtually touch them or i think there should be something around it yeah i have the same interpretation somehow like that you in the of the distance you can feel touched by somebody specifically and this is the guy's name this is the inventor he made a more nice absurds social work and sometimes you think like uh it's also funny because it's also the idea to make um more social work or a social environment with technology but it's it's also nice to think about the failure of it and um [Music] and but in that sense it's already nice to make it more aware and but it it does fail with technology like also what's up or connecting with somebody from a distance for a longer time it's uh it's still not the same so yeah technology is good sense helping but also sometimes failing or cynical and you maybe share the link of uh of the name hope and and share later maybe okay and you do yeah just for the people who are following that they can follow us first yes maybe we should make a ring that tells you like the how many tabs you're open how much you're stressed that's basically like a conversion i know you likes to have a lot of open tabs also or i remember he was having a uh a mac before was like this uh 2011 2012 like this one of the first like these laptops are really good ones for macbooks uh like just a simple macbook and here for a long time and then sometimes when we were working together i see that when he's kind of see what all the things that have opened and i was just have a headache of seeing how many things that he just have open i was just oh my god uh crazy so but yeah maybe this there's a ring that that we should make like yeah you have a ring and then you see like how many tabs you have open or maybe it's becoming warmer as you are like as your cpu is getting warm then your your finger is getting warmer like it's boring you like i'm going to collect exactly it warns me that my brain will explode exactly yeah with your cpu when the cpu is like gonna ah i'm gonna collapse the opposite direction like listening connect the the cpu with the brain and the brain as an output yeah but that's this is actually like a different direction because before we were talking about like human to human and this is like human to computer and i'm actually like because in the practice also like we saw we talked about you know they're all like elements as we are elements like there's no like you know yeah it's dominating or computers are dominating and uh yeah i mean why not like if we feel the stress of from you or from the computer i think that's also you know both valid that is part of like it goes it goes around with this idea of uh uh queries um and futurism like that in other contexts people use a lot of the concept of black foot tourism from perspective also like the let's say in time minorities they are just if you're just like in a blending world at some point they say like wow white race it was just going to be mixed somehow so then sometimes they use like the concept as black food tourism in different ways not only necessary i think afrofuturism is more within the afrocontext and this black futurism is more towards this idea of everybody will become black or like they say there is no pure nobody anymore at some point in the future and it's and i found this uh in this book we were talking uh somehow um yeah that i think the idea of the future is some it's a constant that i see in different constellations around what i do like with joe with you with marco uh melting pot and in different ways like with class and dance like different ways people are really really aware of of of the future because basically i think if you think in the 90s or the 80s when you see the movies and how cool were they like there is this hope for the future in the 80s and the 90s because they were thinking we were thinking about technology back then with a really hopeful sense but then now when you think about future in a way there is this deep sense of like no future you know like there is no future this is exactly and therefore people or uh get engaged more into let's recreate a future that it doesn't exist it's not it's based in nothing just like let's create it from from nowhere nice human bots human after human but then we're not included no we are included because it's just but it just means that we become something that we are that we are but not yet you see that's the way i see it like we we is this is inside of us but we don't know and like the language that it comes from a like language these kind of things are very binary in different ways so they come from different uh clusters of supremacies and oppressions in different ways i think in time we'll get somehow passed and then so we are this already but we don't know yet and we just need to insist that's what i think that's what i said like what i said with naoto if we insist in something that we believe without yet knowing what is it then something something must happen so if we just insist on something that is there but we don't know but there is i think that this this the hope uh and the fate should be it should be part of it i always mentioned that when we talk with uh julie i think this is somehow like the fate like believing that this is going to happen somehow i believe that reality that is not there and together trying to believe in a reality that it's not there but then we have to be like this together and sorry like like togetherness this for sure like yeah just please go ahead but i was just trying to underline it together is a very on that like not alone because western is based on individuality so this is this togetherness of that's why minorities are so important because minorities they don't come for the status quo so they need to so basically they have no agency to express or to even be therefore they just come together to try to find agency to be even just to leave [Music] yeah and how to make yeah the games the more that's like with discussions also how can [Music] more privileged people just just listen and stop talking and give the word to to the minorities and keep on doing that also like then you have groups and then you have the white feminists and they don't understand the black feminists and but that's a sad sad thing because it should go about always how to include the minorities and uh how to include trans people how to include uh people that uh are not understanded yet yet and that's that's uh the queer spirit also uh but that it's really connected with technology now these days for sure like how to connect over the internet how to really still uh have sexuality and and the body and um all right so i'll deal with it and talk about it and a lot of work yeah glitch feminism i think this is a book that i definitely will recommend for people to check it out and if you're lazy as myself um that i'm not really i don't have really the the i don't read that much the way how i bypass the reading is or through videos or through audiobooks so for instance this book you can find it in the audiobook also this glitch feminism nice so like this is like how we go back to the interface cult of like making a new cult it's not culture it's so important it's so true noise so when in these books i am reading like three different things uh what yeah and they're go around this idea like the technology is so at the core of these things of not knowing [Music] like the interface is there like the technology is there um it's so at the core of these things these changes not knowing nice glitch feminism [Music] i can read the the what is its feminism the book the shorts shortly please the divide between the digital and the real world no longer exists we are connected all the time how do we find out who we are within this digital era where do we create the space to explore our identity how can we come together and create solidarity the glitch is often dismissed as an error of faulty overlaying but as legacy result shows liberation can be found within the fissures between gender technology and the body that it creates the glitch offers the opportunity for us to perform and transform ourselves in an infinite variety of identities in glitch feminism roussel makes a series of radical demands through memoir art and critical theory and the work of contemporary artists who have traveled through the glitch in their work timely and provocative glitch feminism shows how the error can be a revolution nice so you you are quite a part of this uh glitch experiments feminism i think i think we all are somehow i think people who are trying to do to we are willing to do this kind of works they are included in this they misfit somehow people who are misfit misfits nice okay maybe i don't know if you uh nauto has something to add or if you do have something to add but maybe we can be closing so we find hashtag now hashtag maybe yes that's you can say that to you ask for yeah just to summarize how what's the purpose to summarize or to or just say like one hashtag for this hashtag and you don't have to the first attempt was complete fail with uh johanna completely failed hashtag yeah totally failed totally real hashtag yeah energies between people and technologies it's nice [Music] i think people technology okay so with this we say thank you to joe for uh joining us today in the chat you guys thank you for being there i will see you all tomorrow and now that i'll see you very soon in the same space oh yeah again i'm in space okay you guys oh maybe i don't know i still don't know but i'll try yes yes yeah okay so ciao guys love you both ciao", "73MwHqOW60c": "hello we are back yes as always with my blurry camera oh i have to start obs to set up the focus anyways are you going with how is it going with your robot uh i will talk in the backstage okay no actually it's it's fine like i'm surprised that uh today the robots are working not perfect but so much better than last week and i'm more confident now we'll be happy we will be happy to see some images of the robots in the chat somehow yeah maybe we can you can just practice from the next nation oh i don't think so the wi-fi connection is really bad there so i don't think it's gonna happen um i was thinking about so i said to no i guess this is a chat so i i arrive related yesterday here and in brussels and then so today i have this i was supposed to start working with joe for this thing for us electronica right and then so i think i'm gonna meet him on tuesday or so tomorrow maybe but then then there was this i was a bit like um [Music] anxious be like thinking like oh okay i mean with pressure feeling with pressure um then i start thinking i fall asleep and then i start thinking that my pressure in a way i mean i was kind of like start pressuring myself for the technology right because then i thought uh i don't know exactly what is that i i should do like in the project um so in a way this is this happens this this is a this is a bit of of a struggle i think is but at the same time it's a it's an opportunity i guess to learn it happens also in seeds or yeah let's in season experience something similar that is um because in a way i know a little bit of everything i can jump in everything if i want um i'm competent in that in that sense i will be competent i'm not mastering any of those topics when i will say i'm more close to my knowledge what is close is to choreographing or to structuring something to direct something um nevertheless then if i i can find myself losing to things that i like right so then um in the project this is that we do in our electronica there is a a focused uh developer so somebody who's working with the in the back ends and front end i think of the project so i don't have to worry about these things um there is something with a data visualization that i think it was running through touch designer so i thought i mean before i left to gree greece already i was thinking maybe i should check kind of like a study somehow or practicing something or with touch designer in that regards or with some something with uh javascript um but of course i didn't have the time of course because it was just i just all right but then i'm sharing this because it's kind of like that's my personal like i feel like um what it's like what should be ready for you know in terms of technology and i think that what i'm trying to share in the chat is that in this case with joe kaimu we're doing this project that is about is is the framework is called on the excitement research and it's based on on iot device wearable that it measures the level of heat that your earlobe have has and then it will change into color and then with that information we do some data visualizations that's the technology aspects of it but then what actually what it makes the project works is the poetics that we create around the project that we said is an excitement research so then we said like depending on how excited you are the life becomes more red uh as less engaged you are is more blue and all the colors in between and we create an engagement between the the audience uh or the participate uh the person who participates in the project and we as scientific we we create uh poetics around the whole thing we put it as a cell to scientific uh research and we do performative things around the project um [Music] so then so yeah then i was struggling a bit like with the technology because the the problem i mean my struggle is that since i don't have too much communication with you in the past years maybe more than one year i don't know exactly i just saw him like for one day shortly or today shortly and the last six months and then more or less i kind of catch up what is the project technologically wise what is going working together for some time right yeah we work we work like uh together like uh closely between 2017 and 2019 i think um [Music] yeah 2017 like for one year and a half we were uh working closing and then after i have to start paying more paying more attention to my studies because he was taking too much of my time in the beginning of the pro in the beginning of the collaboration and i think maybe that's interesting to share in the practices my role was more the designer role and i yeah so which was like joking the original idea comes from job just an inventor and he has this crazy way to to approach his work i think his background is uh product design but then he's doing has done different things like uh he's now finishing this ma masters also this is like his third masters now he's finishing this one in in liens but also i think he starts studying mathematics at some beginning so somebody who is really into learning things and has this um a drive to just learn and and he's like i saw him always like this crazy inventor he'll actually invent things to create like it's kind of like the image the stereotype of an inventor that's joel like he likes to put things together and then boom he creates things that make not too much change for people but he makes something out of it like through poetics and and his artistic approach that was not like a quotation mark here is i'm when we when i started working with seeds in the first project that it was seeker that it was building this spaceship joe was with me in the first meeting or in the second meeting or something i invited him because back then it was which was three years ago i was working with him often then when we were there and we were in this big collect of people start just brainstorming about how to build a spaceship because that was the main concept of seeker and to live there joe starts saying things that um they weren't it was they let's say we were sitting said 20 30 people and what you said some things like two or three times it was completely off you know nobody really got what he was saying or it was it was kind of a misunderstood between a joke no joke or i don't know like i remember he was kind of saying something with a toilet and something i it was kind of misunderstood the communication there um but it's just to say like for instance like i think joe is like a living piece of art somehow i think in a in a positive way i think and that was my role when i entered the project with him because my then back then i was really into designing art which is my project trying to uh use design methodologies in artistic production so i was really trying to just be a designer within the framework and try to not be the artist to relieve the joy for the tension and then i will do the production things and the age the all the the the front things and then he will be relying to be the artistic and his things he needed to do um that was the way how we were working and okay so that's like that's the how we were working so that's the he started uh the way how we work and now so we are not working for one year and a half now we go to us electronica which is very important uh for my career i guess for joe's career also um and also but so i have this gap of one year and a half on the project in technology wise also i know he was not very active with it but nevertheless he was working with peter jan which is a developer from time to time um so when i went to see them he explained me some things that he was doing like technology wise and then i check out okay so i got kind of like an idea we discussed fast like okay this is the open call in arts electronica we fast draw the text what we said in a way like open calling links for all scientists around liens like uh to research about excitement and that's what he jokes so we grow this together fast really fast and then he creates something and then he put it out i don't know which channel i don't know where because i'm very out i don't i don't understand really well how in which framework is working this thing is electronica but then it's as does something that in the wake working with him at some point i was struggling because of the way how he communicates but it's just part of how we [Music] uh yeah yeah that's that's the way how the communication goes i guess i cannot push him because at some point let's say it was part of the things that i was doing before it's pushing because i was trying to do my work as a designer like like you know being very professional at some point i said like you need i remember we make a contract and i said like then you hire my services and then i provide services you know but then you have to pay me like clearly in a contract and these kind of things so at some point i was really pushing these things but now now after one year and a half and more connected also to my artistic side i guess and then then i started struggle a bit of like thinking okay okay technologically wise and then i started going in my head me because i was falling asleep okay these these many things there might be but i have no clue to be honest because i i need to see him and see peter jana and not only understand what is the project because that's what i understood the last time i saw them but is what is joe seeing in his head because that's that's something that i have to translate um what he wants to do exactly what is his vision and and i basically need to translate his words when when when i when i go with him in the next days like to for me to see how can i what can i add into this how can i make this possible through uh in a way then it's through a structuring through choreographing elements in in in in the space there in for certain time um but then so i think i was like this long introduction is to say that um was like so rather than worrying about technology in in many cases i think i think this is connected to the last thing that we were spoken this text where technology is so dominant let's say you know when in the in the text in this uh the article that you're showing how was the name of the text you shared the last time uh i forgot the name but it's about the dance stick pieces right yeah it was dance text pieces so where technology can you maybe like do a short introduction of this like uh just to set what was it no you're not an introduction but yeah just to summarize like the yeah in the this funding uh structure they produced well they um how they say they worked with uh four different groups of dancers choreographers and they created four pieces with um people from the technical side uh like using motion capture and things like that sensors cameras and they created four pieces and then that's the first first part of the research and then they did the evaluation of the research by doing the questionnaires interviewing the audience members who are you know uh first time seeing the piece and the idea is that how they relate the body movements to the sensors do they get the connection between um dance and technology right but then but in a way like the the it was an academic paper right it was like that yeah scientific yeah scientific like the idea like to in a way quantify like effectiveness somehow like or quantify like was it good or bad basically and through interviews right in a scientific way so i'm i was thinking that in relation to what i just said is that when technology is uh is amazing in the like i remember sometimes somebody was asking me in the inputs and two times like what is digital dance and then i said like digital dance is something it's because it's part of the things that are researched in for the school is the digital dances where the technology is takes a big part of or if not the main part of the dance production is through a digital means so that's in short like in a way how i understand what a digital dance or dancing tech is where the technology takes a big part of the production it's not the main production um but you also said dance practice like kind of like when you summarize it like it's also not just part of the production but it's also become part of the practice design important right yeah yeah yeah because yeah it's true and then so in in regards to so what i was saying is like in this project that i do with your like then with the the core of this is that there is a iot device that it is uh and it is it basically it has an rgb and you change the color depending of how hot is your earlobe um so it's very important but it just gives the excuse for other things to happen around it um so i'm making a connection with that because so let's say think technologically why is there a lot of aspects in this project because we have the sensor the sensor has some battery that you know working with electronics so then always there is an improvement i don't know if joe changed that battery but we have some problems before because we could not use it in more than 20 minutes but some of the batteries were not working blah blah blah blah blah blah all these kind of things so there is this there is the this uh the iot but the iot also is sending to a server and the server has been in different ways developed i think the latest one is just a phone that we use we try to use now if i understood now well we always have we always have problems with the positioning of the devices because basically so basically the data that we wanted to use to data visualize is temperature and positioning and then relay and then [Music] distance between uh individuals and based on all these three aspects create visuals but the positioning of the device was always giving troubles um so we did this through beacons and different systems but if you have as uh with beacons there was some delay because that information has to send in real time to a server and the whole thing so always we have problems with the beacons and if i understood well the last time i think they were trying to use the gps not the gps but the bluetooth signal of phones then if you have your iot device then it will connect to a phone and then that phone will connect to some server and then from there basically we traced uh we tried with triangulate this the the positioning of the device so device one in relation to device two or three or four and in that way somehow have maybe not accurate position on on space but more in terms of distance you know in term uh through signal through bluetooth signal you see what i mean i understand it's more about talking to the chat talking to the audience yeah yeah but yeah but basically so as i have mentioned it is that it's a project where there is a lot of technical uh matters to be considered and to iterate over and over and over and over so and then i was worrying of that because i have been off the project for one year and a half so if i tried to i could try to just jump in and try to understand everything because in a way i could understand what is the developer doing what is your doing but it just makes no sense like trying to run in that way you know it makes this isn't it's not working i mean time is limited and also your resources limited exactly right but then what i thought is interesting is then then i woke up with this epiphany and then i put it in the in the in the hybrid document and i started writing um i said [Music] wait i will share my screen and for a second wait a sec ah why do i need to do this all the time i don't know okay this is a very interesting thing yeah yeah why do you zoom that's another question it's easy to use it yeah so it move away i move this so yes there's this life yeah i was thinking like uh life that expresses itself to the fullest through living you know like just living without holding back so are those moments when you feel or what i feel in light i would have felt enlightenment or when there was some deep connection with gaia when you know these moments where let's say for instance i just come back from greece so i'm just very relaxed and then after a long sleep i just laid down in my bed at some point and the cat passes and i was just watching today like the court and move a little bit and i was not thinking you know i was just living like that's like the life of the fullest i don't have more thought than just this is nice right like and that kind of connection that you have that 3d in different ways in different moments i guess when you have drastic changes on space like and you're traveling but you have these big uh changes in your spaces your body is uh is it's easy to change your mainframe of the main space how you perceive life so in my in that case i was just thinking like oh this is actually like yeah then i just wrote like i was thinking that uh i was making this connection through the communication that cares about gesture rather than the content like i said like like i make an analogy between life so life that it lives through living in a way that makes sense in a way if you can think like as expressing the expression somehow it's a life that expressing itself through living yeah without holding back basically of anything or expecting anything just by the mere act of being alive and okay with what is that at that moment and then i make a relation that i was thinking that the communication that cares about the gesture rather than the continent um because we talk about this um i think i think that that's the way how i enter in the let me just try to go just to see if i make sense communication that cares about the gesture rather than the content agency proliferation and creation yeah one can say that the creation of gesture making or block making is one of the best practices [Music] saying this is in relation to the gesture like what we said the last chat that we have at some point i was trying to introduce this i don't know exactly how how we what was in the the communication that we have but that i just mentioned it that from my point of view is a problem about communication um i think it was in relation to yeah the concert the concert and the dance piece because the audience have no problem to understand what is the concert so uh but the audience will have a problem to go to the dance piece and then if the dance is not working somehow i mentioned that that's a problem of communication in the sense of like yeah that you don't understand what is the message there what is your purpose as audience in in the dance tech piece when it's not working somehow when it's not working somehow wait uh yeah let's let's say that way no because if it's not working that might create agency that gives i okay before notification but yeah it's really tricky but let's say there's no yeah yeah yeah i understand what you mean like because you refer that more like as a positive as the as the glitch that agents something to happen right yeah exactly yeah no i mean like literally as jus your audience you go to the uh dancing tech and then you're like this is just not working i mean you don't understand what is it just feels odd it feels odd not in a good way you're lying this is just boring somehow and then you have people who answer that interview in a certain way so it's it's not working it's less functional more functional or something like this but then then i was thinking of this this is and this is about the gesture i think that's what we do then that is uh so it's like it's communication that cares about the gesture but not the meaning or the content at some point i think i found something in in wikipedia it says like this is like do you want to read it yeah it says like gesture has also been taken up within queer theory ethnics studies and their intersection in performance studies as a way to think about how the moving body gains social meaning socialize uses the idea of gesture to mark a kind refusal of finitude uncertainty and links gesture to his ideas of ephemera this guy draws on the african-american dance and drag queen performance caving evans to articulate his interest in what queer gesture might mean but what uh yeah his interest is not in what queer gesture might mean but what they might perform which is the same that what i'm saying here somehow it's not about the content or the meaning but is in in these words might perform i said this is about the gesture itself um and then i was trying to understand a bit so what is this gesture so i was going through um some things that i found um [Music] yeah what what is the gesture for you oh well after after reading this it's it might change a lot because it's it's more about the sign like the meaning i i thought but then that's already negated in the text then yeah that makes sense right i mean the text makes sense that it's interesting yeah it's interesting what you're saying because it's true like the sign it is in there i i found it somewhere in one of these steps i don't know what is it but somebody was saying something else in that relation that it is about signed but yes somebody was mentioning that is um so it's a message that can't that that carries more than a sign like say like symbols because it's not a symbol yeah because it's not a symbol uh letters are letters are symbols so then they are in a way close and then when you through language through linguistics you can abstract this word somehow or through linguistics or poetics you can do tricks to try to open the uh the language itself but as a language is very codified uh it's a code it's an enclosed code um but then what i think is interesting is that the gesture is somehow transmits more than the sign or the symbol if you say you can express through through if i don't know what what and what i'm saying that there in a way i can express more than my words on my limitation in my english language to don't know how to express what i know i would like to express to you right now through my my my my experience through my my arms my hands so there is something that it goes beyond it can it can it goes be it can goes beyond language it's not language based necessary right well i don't know if it's more or less or it's something different i mean i guess it depends and actually like the the quote in the next paragraph is something i wrote down and i don't know if you also highlighted it yeah actually or yes yeah yeah i i just like randomly wrote that uh read that chapter and uh so it's quite interesting that um basically it's along like what you just said but also like she mentions that language itself is um i've got what's the right word like not metaphor but you know like it's also something ambiguous because it also has like the history and everyone takes it differently so it is codified in a way but not i mean to a certain degree but it's not completely codified let's say i forgot how she said it um and but of course like her interest is to compare language to dance and how dance can be you know more ambiguous or like in this example she says about energy um if frequent use of broad and unspecified terms like energy among teachers and directors for better or worse when it comes to discourse dance is very good at taking advantage of babe yeah so like it's a little bit related to the gesture or i don't know if it's the same thing but uh yeah it's uh yeah along that what's what you just said yeah yeah that's what it's about that's why i put it here because i start working in the text about like some like i put it like is i see it as within communication uh because as i mentioned before this that we speak about is about communication and and it's a problem that i saw in when we were discussing this paper about dance and tech effectiveness if you want in a scientific uh spectrum um because if it doesn't matter what it communicates let's say if he's more within an art realm or space and artistic space then then it doesn't matter actually what it communicates like it doesn't matter that much like um but if you want like if you want to put it more in academic place the then it matters somehow that the uh yeah i think there is a problem of communication when you will dance and take there is a problem of communication because i think that's what i put it here it's like dance i think contemporary dances the nature of contemporary dances is very abstract as she mentioned here the way how i learned contemporary classes were way different how i learned ballet classes but late classes the teacher can give me the whole class by sitting in the in the chair and she could say like now she could qualify the whole class without standing up because there's a qualification through hundreds of years of this so there is a really scientific approach to wallet in that sense is let's say it's codification those the steps are codified you can make the whole class sitting in contemporary dance was way different because then the teacher has to go and then she was like and there's a lot on the singing like you know like uh or you will use use more energy oh no or now depending of the teacher it will use abstraction of the movement and there's a lot of the singing there is no codification then from because it's contemporary then you might use within the phrase like now you do around the gym for instance within the contemporary dance phrase uh but the the ho in the yeah as a whole the teacher will have to dance because it's the way how she transmits the body phrase to us as students so the nature what i'm saying is like the nature of contemporary dance is is very abstract uh as she was saying here in this text i think the nature of technology is very direct uh it's very functional so uh because of that that's what i that's what i i i try to make the connection there is a problem in communication or uh there is something around this idea that i'm trying to share i don't know if you get what i'm trying to say yeah maybe you can stop the screen sharing um yeah i also wanted to like talk about a bit of like what i have been doing these weeks because uh not stop video but uh yeah because like today it was like last week uh we've been working on the robots and this week we have uh more people uh dancers are there and we're gonna film um as a dance piece at the end of the week with the robots and it's not the first time we met like i've seen them like last year around the same time we had some rehearsals quote unquote because the robots were not really working back then and now it's kind of working uh but this time like i i just decided like not to have much interaction with the people because like it's just like what you said about the you know role as a designer or programmer or artist but like if i'm involved in this creative process of like like exactly like a you know it's a contemporary dance piece it's not about the form but it's about the energy and how you you know receive from other dancers from the robots and if i'm like i can sit there and talk with them but if i'm involved in this discourse then it will i don't know it's not something i want as a programmer to do it because as a programmer i really need to you know think in a different not think in a different way but it's it's very different like it's not like how we do it in the best practices that you know whatever is fine in that case i think it's so much easier but in this case like we have a paragraphy that's set and we don't want robots to you know stop moving at one point which sometimes happen and if that happens i have to fix it somehow so it's like a totally different mentality like approach to as a programmer and as a dancer so this time like i said you know like i i'm i'm not going to do the dance stuff like i'll really step back and i'm not gonna but yeah but i think this is this isn't revelation exactly is um to it i think you were using your own words one in the last chat you were saying that in your uh perception we talked about this like there was not too much development time for in the pieces in the for the in the four pieces were that were interviewed yeah and then we spent we spent some time speaking about like the idea of the choreographer doesn't really have the sensibility that if you want to create a embodied experience of technology and dance so a synergy rather than functionality then you need to have a long or have a a different uh developing time so in relation to what you're saying is that you cannot do this in this piece although i'll be interesting because you have a deadline that is now so you just need to make it work somehow you need to deliver something right um i think it would be different if you will be i don't know if you have good conditions and you have six months to work on this somehow then you can give more space for other experience to happen perhaps i mean we had time but i didn't do anything further i mean so but wait but i think that could be interesting that maybe in the channel like if you did not do it it's because somehow there was not uh it was not working like you know it should for if the intention i i'm not saying that that's the intention in this piece but if the intention is that the choreographer or like dance and technology blend what i think is what we do in the best practices i think they blend um so if the intention is dance and technology blend and creates a synergy then you you should have understood that somehow or you should have feel that somehow but if you did not is because something was off you know um [Music] and that's really yeah it's like i don't know what's a good analogy but for example if you want to use i don't know laser cutter or any kind of tool that you know you have to turn it on and you have to make sure that everything's right and you know you have proper ventilation all these things that you have to check and then you can start doing things um but you cannot go back you know because not just stop the process like everything is like really structured like just to use a tool and for me the robots are the same like you have to turn on the computer and you have to turn on the tools like in the right order and then also you have to be in a specific place to use it you cannot just bring the robots home and you can use it it doesn't work that way um so all these like conditions that makes me like just not like willing to work not with willing to work is maybe harsh but like i don't want to play with it for my let's say like free time or like for my creation because it's just too much and like i already like in there like if i'm really following the instruction like it's already using a lot of like space resource and in the best practices like it's kind of similar we have to use obs we have to use live lab but it's like you know it's not that strict it if you mess it up it's it's not going to break i mean you can just i start it but don't don't you think the problem what the problem maybe not the problem but what it makes the situation different is that the robots should work i mean you know what i mean what if somebody told you there are these balls like they're robots you know like but but this i mean if you have been more if you have if you would have had more uh freedom with the robots the way how you approach your robots then might be could be different because maybe i don't know you not necessarily you use them all the time you see what i mean like maybe if they don't work if one is not working or two are not working for some reason uh it's different what i'm saying is like you your your offset now is the robots work from then we'll see but your offset already is like the the technology must be on and functional all the time and already that's very stressful yeah uh yeah right yeah that's right like if it something breaks then everything is gone like you have to make sure that everything's working and then you can do something yeah yeah yeah and that that offset already is very it's a pressure is very pressured yeah yeah yeah that's that's what i meant by like it takes so much resource to just to run it that's already like enough for me like yeah yeah i understand but could be cool like to i guess we will have opportunities in the future like maybe with motion capture and stuff like you know with more uh hardware devices maybe motion bank or something like that that when we have uh more hard work involved and all these steps we normally should come um [Music] might be interesting like to to to research because i mean what i'm saying like let's say you cannot you cannot escape the steps you know like say like one thing is one i mean you cannot escape uh i don't know if something is running through a server you need to start a server running you need the steps you need you need to step in certain way so you cannot escape those things but what i'm think is interesting is then it's more like understand to be fluid uh not yet to be to not necessarily be depending on if that works um so then i think if i imagine within the practice and then we said like we're gonna use motion capture and kinex say we have three kinects and the tricky next sense that we have like a real time uh mesh based on three kinects but they need to be activated in certain ways so one two three say for some reason the one is not activate first and then let's say that the the perfect image of the body is not captured because of the way how the kinects were activated mean um yeah what i'm trying to say with this example it might be a bit complicated in each other it's something to happen it's like i think the problem or what i mean what i right now feel is a pro it's a problematic i think in this context is aiming for perfection uh because it's just very unlikely um and more working with technology than we know like this is just not gonna happen something is gonna break so um i think aiming for perfection or not even perfection actually it's far away from perfection so just aiming for uh baseline working you know just just by just passing 50 above working um is is just asking too much uh you know like uh not not allowing it might not work you know like because yeah i think in the practice we are more like from 50 down like 50 down like it might not work something if i will start thinking and in the setup that i do before do a practice then i know before because already experienced this light one time came here and break my 3000 heroes computer for instance like in one practice um so this kind of thing might happen all the time so because of but so because we have practicing for more than one year is that uh we know that in a way like we assume things are not gonna work that was our baseline for the hybrid performance right we know it's not gonna work basically basically that's what we said in a way i mean if you really translated it and that was a fact as well yeah yeah but but i think that's so cool i think that's very cool and it's nothing to underline in the chat is like people if you guys are working with technology assume things are not going to work and that will relieve you because then you need to work creatively around it otherwise you will be stressed as an author right now trying to make the robots working that is the stress or me thinking like in the arts electronica thingy with the server and stuff like is out of my you know anything could happen so i think it's a way to approach this art and tech will be more from the point of view just like not just assuming it might not work like not be it doesn't mean to be pessimistic and say like it's not gonna work but just assuming it might not work that's what i was saying like we will be more 50 down you know in the inputs than like or like 90 actually can i share something please where is it so i made this uh maybe optimize for video clip i made this yesterday just for fun it's a sketch that has morphing and i was quite happy that like after all these you know we do like random stuff i could still make something like this which made me happy i mean the call is not so long it's in p5.js but what i want to say is like like for this one like if you mess up one of the parameters then it won't look good like i don't know maybe like this you see like there's a glitch right that is something yeah exactly i think that's interesting right so what did i want to say like i was like in a way like happy that i came up with this idea of making something like this like a motion graphics motion graphics yeah and and then because i was thinking i was i was thinking about you when you showed that to me i feel like but you i mean that's coding you can do that in after effects in a few minutes i think yeah but maybe a bit longer yeah go ahead that's true um but i did it and i was happy that i could still do something like this although i don't do it and i think i've been better at doing this kind of thing than before like i don't know why um and but at the same time like i don't want to do this like this is so stressful to make things you know aligned perfectly ah because that has to be perfectly yes that exactly yes like how i like misaligned things could be interesting but then it has to have its own style right it's not just one piece of thing that's broken but it has to break in a certain pattern then it becomes more interesting but then that's like all this design work that you have to like concentrate so much and you have this you know a few seconds of loop but then you can't really go anywhere with it there but then i think like i think they're in this well what is what i'm trying to highlight is that i think aesthetics we mentioned in the last chat i think in choreography what i am is like i'm not interested in how good are you or anybody else as good as choreographer or as an artist aesthetically but more of how uh flexible are you a choreographer or creator or somebody else because the aesthetics are very personal so i might like this is uh this aesthetic that you show me or i might dislike them but uh and i think in art and tech we were talking about this in the last chat because yeah i don't know exactly how to make a connection what i'm trying to say is that i think the the way we bypass the aesthetics is because we work not alone um because if you're working alone then you will be constantly having a tick in your head like i don't like this i like this i don't like this i like this when we are the two of us it's so fast that you don't have the time to know if you like it or not nevertheless you somehow have most likes on something because you decide sometimes to keep some frame and then move that's the way how i do sometimes i keep some frame and then i will feel free to move forward so um so the decision making as a designer is still in place but because the other person i don't have so much freedom to stay there and judge me right yeah i mean that's exactly like uh so yesterday i don't know uh if you saw it but i uploaded a video of like i watched a practice and i talked through for one hour no i didn't with my video and your video um and that's from uh october 22nd i think it's the first one after a node like last year yep okay nauto will put this video uh the link of this video in the comments yeah and uh why am i saying this uh oh yeah because it was funny because you appeared after like 15 minutes and and you also like disappeared at the end and like what i was seeing is that myself in the video seems like constantly like judging themselves i mean myself because i'm there alone and so awkward and you came in but i'm already like doing something and there was like nothing really happening between us and it's like this is like awkward practice i i just randomly chose that practice but it's just so funny watching this because it's just so awkward but the best moment is when you asked like you're struggling to find like how to use uh the switcher in vibra but you didn't ask immediately because maybe because you thought that i'm like really in the you know zone and you don't even want to ask hello yeah and then then i think after 45 minutes like you asked like something is wrong with a switcher and then but you know like the conversation wasn't really there because i was trying to do something and you were not screen sharing at first so i was not getting your problem that part was like the best part of that but it's so cool because again now you can see it side to side but back in the practice you cannot see my screen exactly like as a viewer i'm like you know like it's just like i i can see what the problem is and you should just talk you know like do it for like 30 minutes but that this was this is really funny to watch uh when i went to watch it that's interesting yeah you should watch we should do this we should like plan one of like friday night kind of thing you know like with popcorn and we just watch and comment this thing maybe yeah because like yesterday how i did was like i was really serious like more in the performative way but i think it's just funny to do it like you know with a player how how is how is how is called there's a genre of these things happen how it's called these when people are doing this no where people comment on games or anything there is a genre for this yeah i don't know like i i know in japanese but i don't know how it's called in english okay maybe we call it like in japanese how it's called in japanese i don't know but it's like you know [Music] it's live commentary it's kind of boring that's super i like more cheat code gto can you type that in english uh wait or in alphabetical way nor in simple way yeah it's in chat um i was looking at the floor's uh website and it's funny that she uh like in her english website like she highlights the the chat with us oh yeah you have to go to english i miss belgium beers so much i miss belgium beers uh in the english one in the spanish one yes yeah she has like different contents oh yeah get the english one yes we are there like so you have to go to english and then blog and there's us so cool that's very cool thank you shout out yes very nice okay i think i'll go and try to enjoy my night so we keep in touch and what do we want people to comment in the chat last time no one commented nobody comments that so somebody please comment about commenting i don't know about which practice you want to see the g yeah watch about 100 of course exactly of course they have their preference you know they have they they like the one from december 2nd i don't know this is so wrong always i feel this is this is so wrong the last part of how we close the chat always is so wrong is like oh it's like the is this we are trying to do our best and then user experience we don't know how to do this and then we always end up like just like it they don't so yeah yeah you're doing your best you're doing the best it's the best practices yeah just tell us tell us your favorite best friends we uh goodies we should like we should keep on we we will keep on thinking on goodies and how to offer goodies or something yes how to engage for people to get something back yeah maybe maybe people can comment like will you be guys we guys would you like to have some stickers we have stickers well you asked already what goodies you want and i think no one no one replied no oh what do you guys would like if somebody would like to hear something about something we talk what what did we talk today about it maybe we can do this sometimes what did we talk today about communication and gestures communication gesture yes so maybe you guys tell us what you guys would like to hear more about yeah or not what's topic what if they start talking about i don't know something irrelevant well nothing can be yeah maybe some of you guys if some of you guys have more information about like uh gesture in relation to performance performances or performing art because i'm i think i'm interested in this in these days you know who is really like uh i remember olivia from brazil she has her work around the gesture of dance i think it's called the gesture of dance um because i remember at some point when we were talking maybe one year ago she was referring to this research that they had she has around this idea and i was like i mean i understood what gesture means you know like as an english word somehow but i never really give a thought until now that i'm trying to go into the core like of gesture as well as an ontological research and she she really has experience she has been working on that maybe for four years well so so she will be somebody to invite for the chat soon yeah we've been we want her to be here olivia uh yeah she said it would be i guess you will have some time now okay maybe just be close here and we go to uh backstage so please write i mean whatever about gesture what is gesture for you and then please like the video and subscribe and uh my poster my youtube poster will be in cologne from tomorrow so please check that out and see you next time thank you for being there ciao", "odnK-qqMjnU": "oh i have to wait for you to connect hello well looks nice tell me about the sound because the connection is really slow [Music] hello connection like it seems to me that my connection is good and it seems my work no no i don't see you uh it's like two frames per second it's still now still this is slow can you hear me i can hear you much better but the video now video is off and when video's there it was very slow i just changed them now because i just changed to my data okay i was using i was using the wi-fi number doesn't change much okay i will just do the audio yeah it's still but it's too nice to be in the camera yeah wow okay is it like this all right so can you hear me yes no it's good good so hello hello should we i guess yeah this is chad i think i would like to talk about the chat we talk about details like more backstage things and other yeah later later okay so hello now okay so i hope you're having a nice vacation yes so i'm increased i'm having a very good vacation i'll try i was trying to detox from my phone but i felt good i feel good i think i guess you did something similar in austria right yeah i was away for one or two days um and the first day like i was trying to use like only like paper and pen to make something which is very interesting yeah but i i didn't use the phone for like a few days like i i came back to the computer but um but yeah like one day i was not using my computer or phone at all which was good yeah yeah it feels great i mean to be honest with you like at some point i thought it would would be more drastic you know like i'm not gonna use it at all but then i need to use my phone you know i need to use my gps yeah so which is not the email and the social media and not emails i mean i i checked my email still because i was waiting i'm waiting for a claudius jordan's answer so then i could see if there is something i need to react right away yeah that's that's life hey but so this paper was uh so tell me maybe you can introduce us uh for the people here in the chat hello people lately like you should or last video have more than uh it has many views for what you're used to yeah why is it called you share it oh yeah that was like i put it i put it in my instagram feed i think yeah i see my in my social media right uh and there was a comment and the comment 23 views which is a bit more than the ones we had before yes something we have four two your grandma my grandma exactly so [Music] yes but so maybe you can introduce us the video like the video this paper the paper yeah so yeah so basically you know uh sent me this paper that he wrote um who is nuno who is luna because i don't know he's yeah he's running this um he was running this uh how do you say it's an organization but it's more like a it's a project called moving digits and that was like funded for one or two years i think or maybe more by uh eu some kind of funding uh from eu and basically the idea is to connect like a few different places um around europe uh including where i work right now uh high state uh the university of applied science in dusseldorf and uh he was back then based in like a school in the uk i think there are other few organizations involved and basically connect um dancers choreographers and people working in technology to create um digital how to say like a dance stick pieces and this okay specific paper was about evaluating um some of those pieces that they made in that train [Music] so which basically is it's coming back to the last when we have the stuff with uh which is an astrophysics and we're into this topic right like the quantization or like uh like right yeah measuring measurement how the effectiveness of how are these how to measure effectiveness of art in the in in culture in daily life basically and analyze risks yeah well i don't know what the risk is but well maybe we can analyze the risk um yeah so basically this paper like part of the paper is i mean the the objective of the paper is the evaluation because it's in the scientific conference called t t-e-i uh what's called tangible embedded and embodied interaction and so that's actually is what they the last time sorry like that's what but she was talking the last time and she was sharing with us is uh the struggle that should be that she feels that when [Music] she's in the position of like yeah measured yeah she used this word tangible that's what i'm trying to say okay how yes yes yes yeah i think the conference um the reason why they say tangible is actually they work with like tangible interfaces like not just like creating software but it has to you know be in real life wow it's kind of absurd to say it that way but like for example if you make a new kind of um how they say like interface like controller or you know that kind of thing is what they call like tangible but in this research it's it is tangible because anyways it's a physical um dance pieces so you mean tangible in the sense that it is it's not it's not only a software but it's something that is a hardware house something that it becomes physical right right like how hardware like implemented with the hardware let's say an interface okay a software that it has an interface yeah okay [Music] okay but i didn't understand that i'm interested in like in regards to who is nuno is that how is he connected with dance is he i mean you know in short like his background is i honestly no idea i only met him once actually during this interview of the paper so i am involved somehow um how how did you how did you met him so he contacted you no i okay so the thing is i worked for wait so this research was in 2019 like uh like around october when they performed and the same year like earlier i was helping troy kafai who is who is also involved in this moving digit project and but not like i was not directly involved in that frame of moving dishes but i was helping troy garfield earlier that year and also the theater where he performed was the tenth house in rw is also part of moving digits so it's like i was not directly involved but i was kind of already in the you know the same crowd and later i i learned that there's going to be like a showing so i didn't know about the interview i just went to see the showing um and then it turned out that they do like this you know scientific study so uh yeah i volunteered to take the interview and is this like in the is like german base or is like or in an european level it's european um but quite a lot of well not really a lot of organizations involved from germany i think it's just the the school and uh dance house okay interesting all right so maybe now we can just dig into the jews yeah i think just to add well and just add like because we've been talking about this project because the funding is already ended but they want to apply again to you know like have the second phase of the project so that would be they're moving this moving digits project yeah exactly i mean it's not going to be the same but they are like with the same people they're trying to do it again so that's why like you know i'm kind of slowly involved in this discussion and to see like what what i can help or person i think i think it's super interesting and i think it's very relevant like i mean when i was reading the paper now author proposes me to i mean you send me the pdf like the pdf and it's a long paper so i didn't read it all but then you mentioned it and so you mentioned like the 4.3 the interviews okay and what are you part of these interviews yes so one of them is me and just to add a bit more context uh there are four pieces uh at perform uh tenth house and uh they were quite short i think like i don't know like 10 to 15 minutes or something per piece and also like they only had like a few days of like creation with actually with the technology like most of them involve like using sensors and stuff um cameras visualize visualization um but unfortunately they didn't have much time to for the you know creation so they're quite like let's say underdeveloped it's not like a final piece but it's more like a yeah like uh how they say it how do you say it uh work in progress kind of works something maybe it's something that i can say in that regards is so funny to see that because i mean like they said like the technical uh deployment of a dance piece is so undermined that saved light uh design you know the light testing sound testing ethnography all these things they are so undermined for instance when i work with import i have sometimes one hour so it's like so undermined that it's like uh you know it's like given that it has to work because at the end it works you know like people cannot really see the effects because at the end of props it's technology at the service of dance right so our props they makes the dance look better but the dance for itself should be nice so what i'm saying here is that the deployment time of the technical team in a dance piece is really uh undermined and it's just it seems normally will come from the choreographers or theater makers people don't really have in consideration that research in time i mean the deployment time in the technical research uh it is also uh how to say this like i think uh choreographers or theatrics makers they they don't consider what i think is at this point i think that the deployment uh in a dance piece of uh of technology it's a research it's a it's a working process something is not perfect as you know it's always gonna it's the it's developments is yes that's what i'm saying like deployment of technology in a dance piece is still development time you see what i mean yeah and then what you just mentioned is not even like interactive like yes yes please yeah go ahead yeah so like how do you say it like it's you know kind of in a way it's independent of the from the dance i mean it is connected but um like it's not like you know using sensors and stuff that's even more you know that needs more time absolutely because we and the way i presented exactly my ideas more in a classical way when choreographers wants to use technology that's what it happens yeah but if you put it that in on top of that you're trying to make a synergy between technology and dance then it just becomes a completely the deployment time is completely different yeah right well in another way like in a sense like if they spend more time like not with the you know like even with you know lighting and like not like really interactive things they could do something more than what they have i mean i don't know if that makes sense but no can you say like if they invest more time in like actual like development like creation with you know like lights and sound and you know that's that's not like even like interactive things like because in the paper or the context we're talking about is dance tech but uh let's say like dance yeah it's functional yeah that's what i will call that spawn is uh that's what i mentioned in the big in you know what i i said i mentioned as props those are probes light as prop mapping video mapping as prop you know like something that is it's like a sonography basically yeah it's a stage design right okay so where where are we now and so the let's go back to the paper maybe the other paper yeah um what was that uh so there are two things actually like one is the interview and another one is a questionnaire so everyone watching the piece um it was free i think but we had to like fill in the questionnaire you know and these questions are like i forgot uh well it's in the paper i forgot most of them but basically it's about like how much like connection you felt about the you know the visuals or um yeah sound uh with regard to the movement right so it's very like you know something it's not like you like it or not but it's it's more um measurable in a sense uh which i don't know if it's it's a it's a valid question or not but i think scientifically it's something you know you can quantify in a way it's still like psychological yeah but it's a bit weird because if i think in seeds then at the end we have this questionary that peter and angelo they feel for their own phd research and in both they are focused pretty much in the fn and how effective and is art in society just in different ways uh yeah so it's a similar it's a similar approach i see but like is it like a more like qualitative or quantitative but it's this doesn't think because the questions where you know like for instance like the questions that i remember that i was like it's like do you feel connection with the wood installation for instance that kind of question do you feel okay a connection a personal connection with installation so the question is there they don't they don't really mention what kind of connection no exactly it's not that okay you a hundred percent fifty percent it's just an open question i see and you interpret it and answer as you can yeah but then like i don't know like this is really like specific question but like i always wonder like does it does there have to be the connection because this is like a tricky question because if you want to you know score really high with this question then you can just have a kinect visualization or something like that like mocap you know with the points moving avatar i mean one of the pieces is actually like that but then you can clearly see the connection between the visuals and body for sure but is that it doesn't mean it's a good piece no that's what i think one of the main aspects that i read in the in the paper in different ways is like in different ways they're talking about with different words you know about functionality how functional is the piece in regards to light or in different ways you know one part was the video mapping the other one was power relations so hierarchies between the dancers and the technology right and yeah so but in any way is there is this functionality that i will say is more close it's coming from design um yeah so this functionality that the science provides you know like this yeah the design is delivering a tool right yeah this is like i think interesting point like you said the functionality because yeah like basically what's the functionality of a dance piece and like in that sense like what we do is really not functional right it's just like showing images and doing whatever there's nothing but i think the interesting in what we do is like it's so we start without really knowing what is that but in their research like person we have already papers that from our point of view we write consciously about this aim to not be functional right we consciously know now that we don't want to make it functional or that we don't want to make a final piece yeah i mean functional in different ways like we're not trying to make it functional in a technological sense and also in from a dance perspective either exactly like i was saying yeah like like we're not trying to impress somebody or with the dance moves or with the images right so from a aesthetical uh point of view is not something that is aimed to be formally good right and we're not even achieving anything but we're happy yeah exactly um but that's that's really nice point i think because we could also you know hack this as well like you know we can in the next uh performance quote unquote we can have a questionnaire that resembles this paper and probably we will score really bad and that's the achievement we make but i think this is something that you think reminds me bringing me back to the failing at node because that i think that was like a milestone in our project because we were aiming for something good there i some expectations and then right after we failed in a way we were relieved from any pressure in terms of succeeding we were like we failed this was good actually right yeah that was that was something um because we we had a kind of goal like with the mozilla house and we tried to make something not maybe not impress people but we wanted to make something during node something good yeah we want to do something good yeah yeah yeah okay um well that's one thing um i want to say something about the paper because i think there are like four pieces and to be honest like what i really remember is the one that didn't have clear connection between the dancer and the technology um i don't know if you have the pdf now but yes i have it here you know which one i don't know you can spot it but there's one that has like a like a big monitor that you know like a tv on the stage which shows like a visualization of like waveform it's really simple um but basically this is like a um siri or alexa kind of thing that just talks to the dancer and the dancer right on the performer on the stage she talks back back to it i mean it's all scripted i think but it's like a dialogue between this machine and human and she you know dances and uh like that's already like something to remember and also it's it really stood out because it completely failed like the program crashed at one point like halfway like after like five minutes it crashed and the the creator of these like artists she came to the stage and tried to fix it and um and she was like wonderful she was almost crying like but you know like i was like you know like you know you can just take time and try to do it you know try to fix it yeah but i think that's that's the beauty of that in a way we are trying to acknowledge you know like when we see these dance pieces in the impulse dance then often we came back to these uh discussions about like yeah but the error the glitch was not acknowledged and right and i think in technology since it's so not reliable in so many ways as we know uh um that's why you have to work on that weekend so yes in your robot so but then um i think to make the leap for the connection between the human error and the acknowledgement of the computer error that is the i think is it that's what trying to set it to highlight is that people like people who are not really i guess have an embodied practice against with computers then will think that the computer will be perfect or they will try to make something perfect that it works so there is functional always so there is this tension because it is not working the whole piece crashes so i think it's i found for instance within the paper in different i think it's connection between the dancers i think they speak something about it and also in the power [Music] power relations people speaking different ways about layers about added layers also about meta meta information which is basically [Music] when in somehow there is not a direct functionality or direct connection that as a spectator you expect let's say that something is working then this this kind of glitch in the information gives space for other it gives agency for other meanings to happen then they met and that's why people put or an added layer or a meta information like for example um that's right from what what we do or like what we saw ah so what we do in what we do in the paper think of the paper connection between dancers i didn't really get the i mean i saw it on the paper about the connection between dancers but what does it really mean i mean but i think what i'm trying to see what i'm trying to say is that um where when the the use of technology within the dance piece is somewhat not uh straightforward i'm talking from the point of view of the viewer of the audience when the audience don't understand exactly that when the dancer moves the right arm and the visuals to a or b when people don't understand exactly the functionality of technology in the choreography that uh give agency for other reasons to happen and that's what i'm trying to and in the paper there are some places where people were saying that as a post because basically because because as an audience that you don't is we talk about this sometimes like and i said this to kristen uh from iwobi when i saw the dance piece that i told you that it was good yeah in the info sense there was a dance piece that was with technology um [Music] one of the yeah it was some kind of like assume it was something special um but what i'm trying to highlight from there is that um as a as a criticism that i shared with tristan i said uh [Music] that in some how it felt to me that sometimes it was like uh there were too much like the approach to the magician of you know technology has to surprise you right like this is the magic but once you as an audience you understand the trick is boring after just few seconds right so you have to constantly surprise them if you want to go in the same direction but then it's just it's super difficult that's what i felt with the the piece with the lights you know this uh pink stage with pink lights yeah because that piece like i felt like at first the lights were like so impressive you know this i don't know if it's fluorescent or fluorescent light like leds but it's so cool but then i felt so insecure that like is that the you know because they show it at the first at the beginning of the piece and is that the only thing that they can do which was the case you know like i mean there are some different patterns but basically you know you see the magic and then then you know it [Music] right for the rest of the piece yeah and i think something else it was from what i understood in this paper that it was kind of a straightforward way to use visuals in the dance pieces where i and and i can see myself else in the beginning when i was working started working with technologies this kind of aim to uh to represent or actually not represent but just to literally kind of create another body like an audio visual body i will say that it represents somehow the dancers the dance the dancer on the screen or something true or an avatar or through straightforward some visuals that somehow resemble uh a human yeah avatar a body a body but then like what is it because this is like you know it's it appears flat on the screen and it's not the dancer so the viewer has to actively make a connection between them but i think what makes it complicated is like i guess it could be interesting let's say if the dancer is not on the stage waiting sometimes me trying to solve something that is not about solving but i think objectively what it happens is that if the dancer is competing with the technology it's just like a lost war or like is is it you know i remember at some point when i was in puff i understood like i remember i think i shared this with you at some point when i have the smoke machines lasers ltd's have projection mapping on the church right and then i thought i was talking with my face also who was helping with the sound and for me was like what is i mean how can i how can i compete with all these lights and lasers and stuff like what is the reason for the body to go there and compete in terms of attention with this you know it's just it's almost like a lost world before starting yeah so i that's what i was mentioning in terms of the avatar like i don't know perhaps is because as an audience you have to constantly fight between the attention what is more interesting so and in here in the point the paper they speak in the 4.35 they they speak about other added layers and multiple meanings and and it's i guess it goes in that direction like if the technology adds a new layer that possibility multiple means then it's all good but if it's just something that is trying to enhance enhance or i don't know make it more uh bombastic or spectacular it's just uh [Music] it's like bad rock somehow it's like baroque is adding more and more and more and more um which i think maybe i which i think aesthetically could be good or bad depending on the decisions but i don't think that's really interesting i think what is more interesting because in that from that point of view it's just basically the choreographer being a good photographer or a bad pro from me especially my perspective as an audience so rather than for me to to acknowledge you now as good photographer or bad professor i would like to think more in what the peace gives to me you see right like not to think how good are you in taking aesthetic decisions um it's maybe i don't know if it's not relevant but when you said something about the you know like the so basically dancers if they compete with the technology they can't win um as you know compare comparably small size compared to the lights or projection but that that only works the there's one case that works is when you have you know um like if it's like a you know lady gaga or someone you want to see you know like they do a concert in a huge stadium and it still works because people want to see her on the stage no matter what you know like you can't really see her from probably most of the seats but you still go there because you want to see her but it's not the case with dance piece i mean no but that's something because i think yeah because i think it's interesting what you're saying because the way i see it is that you go to a concert that is using uh technology like apex twin twix is very good in doing this kind of things and yeah the different bands were doing really nice multimedia works in their concerts but then the thing is like once you go to the concert you understand you're you're doing you go there to see a concert so you your brain is not challenging that you know there's somebody singing right and then the whole the whole lives and lasers and paraphernalia is just adding to that experience but at the end in short it's just a concert right the thing is if you try to if you put it in the dance piece but then the technology is overwhelming like then your brain starts not knowing is this you know you start questioning like is this dance to mention that you pay is this damn maybe um why not he wrote why not yeah this is that's something because the concert is not like you're not going there to judge i mean you would judge but it's about the experience you liked or not but you wouldn't say you know um like you don't criticize in a way like it's more like going to a party yeah but the dancing true and dance means you have to criticize somehow i mean i don't know as an artist or you know choreographer you would you would you cannot just see it and you you you would say you know i i like those lights you know you don't say that i mean you would say that but it means a lot like compared to you know what uh lady gaga or rihanna had on the screen like it's very different but the problem is that people what people imagine immediately with this media media you know like led screens or lasers or folk machine that always goes back to this you know huge stadium concert and also in fact like some companies do both like moment factory or you know these huge companies they do like huge concerts and also they do their own artworks it's quote unquote yeah like that's where you're like marshmallow laser pieces exactly friends of us that we're gonna see new now in essen in the coming weeks by the way uh yes for a reason like they do these huge installations for bmw for like all these companies but at the same time they have their artistic uh uh work yeah um but going back to the concert thing but that's that's the problem that things are kind of blurry or like like they're kind of mixed up but people often forget that one side of the party you don't you judge the experience you liked or not but with the art artwork or dance piece you criticize as like is it dance and that's a huge thing i think yeah but what i think is because i i think it's in terms of the way i see it is it's uh i think it's about them i won't even mention the medium cannot get complicated but it's a communication so i think it's and then communication goes between the person who commits the message and the one who receives the message so in the concert when you go there already you know that you're gonna listen to some songs so like the message is the song that what you will receive before you go there you understand what is what is your function as public there is to go and see a concert uh and i'm repeating here but i think it's because going to the concert is simple then you go to as you said to enjoy the concert you're already you know the songs you know what respect even though the show might be bombastic you know it's about the music while in dance then i think if i'm interested when dance just opens gate open the gates for other meanings to arrive to give agency to the view to not have a passive spectator but rather to propose places where the people can have their own meanings and interpretations and questions about their own lives it's not a passive entertainment in that sense i would say the concert is fast that's in that sense i think a concert will be close to watching a movie yeah yeah totally why are we talking about this because of the technology or i think because i think it's because of the um i think it's just in general about the technology [Music] let me just do recapping in a way from the text why series and they mentioned i found interesting in the text when they start speaking about uh added layers and multiple names which is basically what i was just mentioning before uh in different parts of the text the people refer uh foreign uh connection between the dancers or our relation the different interpretations of the text are in terms of like this works this doesn't um because of this and it's very clear but in the part when they start talking about added layers and multiple meanings it gets a bit confusing um in the text itself and what do you mean but at the same time because it's quantitative the the text exposed the answers of the interview as uh this was positive because it was not clear in short so like the purpose of the functionality of the technology were not clear and because of that there were other layers and multiple but so like what do we learn like is it i know this is stupid argument but is it better if we have more added layers is it better if things are more ambiguous like if we speak if right if we are talking about this practice i mean i mean i i i speak i speak from best practices and in relation to this this that we are discussing and then i'm thinking that um is that um i think we're achieving something because there are many added layers because we have not a clear purpose um because there's not a clear purpose without a choreography or structuring a piece we are adding layers constantly and erasing and putting again and on and on because there is not a piece there is a practice so uh one can set going back more like an academic page like i guess one can be a practice or find the best practices in the practice and then said like in terms of say add multiple layers of create this positive thing that i see within abstractions um in an academic paper i think one can dissect a practice and say like this works here this could be better because [Music] basically dissect and see what are the functional abstractions in a way but we might be interested to do it but for us like added layers is always like really random like most likely there's no connection between one layer with another but people can see it or actually that's not true like how we add things either it's like a song or it's like a color or you know images there is something like it's not like we just find something completely random but the the one what i want to say is in the case of the paper the performances there are like something like connection like with a sensor or maybe it's just with the queue of the choreography but it's there are layers added but they are a bit more it's it's a bit clearer than how we add layers absolutely absolutely absolutely because yeah absolutely that's the whole point that's what i was mentioning choreography and structuring because those are pieces and they are they are they're pre-programmed you can say that they're coded and then after in the show they are running but they are coded and there is a thought to there is a choreography there is a clear uh structuring and what we do is more is an improvisation that's why we don't mention as a piece you know it's more a framework which is close to dance to improvisation then advance itself right but to be honest like when you were saying added like added layers i was thinking like what we the layers we add is always so random i mean it is improvised but in fact we have some you know like cause and effect in a way that something triggered me to you know add some colors it's not that i just roll a dice i mean that is also a cause actually um i will translate this into our concept like this that is like added layers we call these elements i will now add elements elements and grouping and ungrouping that's the difference because if you start speaking about adding elements then i think you can say like maybe we add layers that sometimes we subtract layers we erase all the layers you see what i mean if we want to speak in terms of like addition or like mathematical terms but i think in our concept building the way we speak about is about elements and grouping and ungrouping these elements right and i think because there is a there is a constant we do this for more than one year every week so um and sometimes we get in the flow going back to early chats we go into the flow once we get into this flow there is a there is this connection that we can feel but sometimes not yeah so this is like something i think like so not not the layers but let's say the elements but specifically about like why this grouping or ungrouping or uh yeah like why it happened like cause an effect um either we do it in a way that like uh danai is doing like you know annotating videos or um what uh i think julia one of the professors she suggested you know what about narrating the practice the past practice um these things are like we talk about it all the time and we haven't done it so much or we don't have we haven't done it yet and i think we should really go back to this idea because that also i think i think motion motion back motion back would be super interesting but the question is like does it have to be functional or not that this process uh i think the process itself is trying to be functional i mean and and there how to quantify uh the functionality of it that's the second mistake but just the intention of trying to uh do that that the intention itself is functional i think yeah right and maybe that's that's where we start making the json file for us exactly the json json file seems like a nice like a sweet spot yeah yeah it's a huge that huge database for us to access via json calls and api yeah but yeah this this would be like i'm all like always interested um it's just that i feel like it's a lot to do but maybe like something to you know think about it um like a bit uh low-key way of annotating so it's not like you know but what danaya does is really just crazy like she just watch all the videos and but it doesn't like yeah no but it could but i think it's interesting i have this conversation because it's this woman who was working with sonography in berlin and we were speaking about like the basically is that it will be super interesting that other person does it for us because then the political side of it is out you know then we don't have to deal with the functionality of the context and it's just given that somebody else to do it and and that would be just a beautiful thing because then we don't have to struggle because we have personal attachment to the practice so that makes the whole thing a bit difficult when you try to work with science yeah that's why like in the email i wrote like i think it's interesting if like a researcher interviews us i mean it can be myself as a researcher but you know it needs some kind of separate it has to be a separate reality even if it's myself you know i cannot just write about my experience i have to you know understand it's it's a bit i mean it's referring to sandbox obviously um yeah and that i think that's i mean in a way we already do it with a chat but then i think the chat itself if the chat itself has a methodology scientific methodology let's say whatever that means then it becomes i mean i wouldn't say it's interesting but we could present it into like to different people like how we did it with idocd but maybe in a more academic conference and they might find it interesting i don't know yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah but this is what i'm mentioning this is going on just like backstage but i think this is what i was mentioning to you when we were in vienna and then i mentioned uh we need to start thinking with different hats that's another hat that's another hat publicity had i mean just different but ideally let's say we have a huge production then we just assign people to do these things but we can do the effort to first i think that's for me it's basic otherwise it's not going to work first it's like keep the sandbox as it is include the chat um but then a part of that thing they start using these hats and then just thinking more outside of the practices so outside of the practices of practice but when i started seeing the practice as a about the practice as a product within capitalism and then just uh then start entering in the college in that sense like what is there actually that we want or we we think that we can't survive as yeah and they just start speaking from that point of view from the ecological point of view we think capitalism but that's about but anyway anyway i think the the sandbox it it should stay as it is because that's what it gives us the joy of doing this yeah for sure there's no question it's just about like the hat or like who we work with and yeah i'm like i i want to publish this video but i would say openly so maybe i just say that you know if you're studying i don't know like uh human computer interaction or even like neuroscience you're making the you're making i think you're making the open call to be tuned to microneeds [Laughter] if you if you have a phd between neuro linguistics astrophysics and contemporary dance and contemporary guys people do yeah phd in contemporary arts so why don't contact us otherwise not i think i will i will i will reframe it i will say like if somebody is interested to do something for what we have for the material that we have i'm being or if somebody's interested to do something within or with the content let's say that we have we speak of we spoke of this in vienna so i think it's just if somebody would like to do something with the content that you can see in youtube and and a part of that you see there is something in a specific framework that you would like to do please contact now auto contact me the is i guess you can contact now to youtube channel otherwise we will put it uh now to email my email in the comments under this or the best practices in at gmail.com i think exactly yeah so you can you repeat this email again because i don't i'll write it down but um best practices in gmail.com that's our shared gmail so we can uh like either one of us can um check and respond yeah and this one yeah or maybe we should have a form or something on the web page we can we can think of this but i think with this we can close the chat i think now i want to go to lindo's beach that's my plan for today do you want to show the video again yes of course we just bring uh oh wow so this is the lobby but then we have a private key so this is the social one but we have a private one and it's so nice it was really it really i really enjoyed this time here with his personal time it's very very needed for refreshing the world before going to the arts electronica and new now but were you now you were in brussels for a few days and how was the weather like it's so cold here it was it was so bad it was it was raining as was horrible it's okay but uh it's really cold like chill like a few days like you know i i was freezing no i know and brussels was horrible it was so cold like really bad like i mean this kind of weather then when i took the plane it was raining and i i was so happy because i knew in greece it's gonna be 30 degrees so but yeah i go back uh [Music] on sunday go back some day late night i go back and then i will start working with joe tymo before the project on arts electronica the excitement research on i think on tuesday i said on monday but i think i will take one day off and then from tuesday and then on saturday we have the barbecue for closing of seats and yeah and then i will do some other chats i need to talk with you there's some interesting things i was here i went to the astronomy there's an astronomy cafe here a beautiful place i went to the ancient museum ancient technology a greek technology okay and that was wonderful to see the thought you know their thinking on technology before christ was wondering nice yeah yeah i'm looking forward and i i i bought a coding machine i will show you like ancient coast machines okay i i see it yes yes all right bro then i'll leave you i will show you we can say goodbye to everyone yeah so like the video like the video subscribe there are five more subscribers these days thank you for that and please write in the comment uh what i don't know last time i want to collaborate if you want to like that's really specific what what do you want us to do next time like right right academic paper that's kind of boring but do you practice in grief no no no yes we do a practice in greece in the astronomy it'll be wonderful yeah where do we want to do the practice that's the comment please please write oh yeah that'll be good yeah yes where do you want the practice to be all right thank you the like thinking to the person who was commenting that last time i hope you enjoyed the magazine i'll see if you have some comments and that would be nice to hear your feedback on the text because those are texts okay see you next time", "BdrJjP1P4GY": "continue hey we are back in normal in the squares uh yes we are back to the normal setting i guess is this normal well we we're in the square so we're back in squares through so i don't know if this is chat or this is backstage we will see what is it we'll see um but it's nice to see you i can say that yeah it feels more natural it feels different but at least at least i don't think it feels different what i think it feels different is the chat because when we were doing the chat in the spot it just feels so you have to speak about something you know what i mean like when we are in the spot and we said like now we do a chat it's like you feel the pressure i was feeling the pressure like now i have to speak about something through the chat but now like this could be the chat we'll see where it goes but i don't feel that pressure you know true because oh my gosh now like my my thoughts are like like kind of clicked and now it's like the chat like moment how do i say like it's kind of opposed to what you said but like now i kind of start to like feel that no no because i started to feel like okay now i'm in the chat but as you said now i can we can choose to be on the backstage or not right yeah yeah yeah but it's okay i think it's okay like even if it's backstage i think it's fine like how i feel now no no okay if maybe it makes sense the way i see this is like i think the difference is like now we are in the zone that we don't know about this this is a chat or not and we are like we'll see um but if we are in the space because we want to put something online it's almost like we know this is a chat you know yeah it's like the time frame i think we don't give too much space for say like we don't upload that but every time we say like this is a chat we were speaking in the chat format yeah you know i mean basically every time it's like everything else is backstage because we just talk when we're but the there is like here we keep it open and then we decide like now becomes chat exactly no that's what i'm saying that's the really huge difference because now it can be either way but if we start film and then in in real life we meet and then if we start filming and then we wouldn't say that's a backstage it's a little bit weird i mean we can keep it you know it's a private video it's a probably yeah but i see yeah yeah i see yeah i see i think it's also like related to performativity in a way maybe it's it's very much about performativity yeah yeah misty but it's funny because like anyway like i think because anyway like here in a way like if we are not recording always there is the performance performativity it is within identities right and as well like uh judy butler she will speak [Music] about identities and gender trouble when she speaks in the book [Music] there is all this trouble with gender and identities and things that you cannot escape somehow not only because of you but things that you just grew up with and the society that you are so the i think what is different is that in the chat somehow setting the framework of the chat then in a way we are in a container you know that in a way we yeah i think i feel it's kind of like a container that it contains certain topics um but if i'm out of the container of the chat then i can be myself which which in both states where performativity is in there but the container like being within the container of the chat in somehow means performativity in terms of i think like ecologies of economies are more in their implicit because i think directly or indirectly we are trying to do something you know what i mean there is an intention there is a clear intention to talk in in the chat in the chat framework what while when you are out of that container it's just anything so it's still about performativity but it's just my life and your life and everything so there is not a clear purpose in the in the child out of the container could be yeah one can say you know there could be like a glow a different container yes but then what i'm trying to say is like performativity in both cases it stays the difference is like in the chat in a way the economy somehow comes with within like the ecology in terms of like of production in a way you know there is there is a clear intention we are here to speak about the chat say um yeah but in in both cases there is the performativity is in there [Music] maybe going back actually to what like in the last chat that we have she was mentioning like in terms of signs when she would make the relation between science and art and like that both have these research fields but like differences like how much like in science you have to quantify results in order to get supports of grants of like there is this sense of measuring uh attached to signs uh to quantify how good evaluation so again about evaluation yes all these kind of things that in our we don't really have and i'm mentioning that in as an analogy as how i see performativity in the chat or out of the chat like i think in the chat in a way implicitly we are trying to evaluate i i don't think it's evaluated but in a way we are trying to it gets in that that's what i mentioned ecology is an abstract way to mention economy because there isn't a clear intention to try to be within the framework there is some what functional i don't know it's not just you and me talking but it's the chat you know yeah because that also comes with like ourselves in the sandbox that's already like kind of someone else that we try to treat so it's not just two of us but already four people involved in a way and also because chat is part of the practice well not part of the practice but it's in parallel and it cannot exist without the practice i mean that's actually like i never thought about like because we do it as best practice chat but can it stand if we don't do the practice i mean but that's the i've been thinking of that because first thing you said that and i was just thinking like the way how i see it is that because for me clearly it's like in the practice i'm trying to escape jorge's identities as much as i can right so to not be rational and in the chat then i will just be jorge somehow and with all my identities and then i just try to think rationally in that context so from that point of view i will say then like when we speak about the sandbox like when i really see as a sandbox is always the practice but of course like in a more global scope one can say like the chat is a sandbox itself but for me at the core like the sandbox as i see is the practice because it's in there that i can just risk yes i think maybe that's a good way to see it like in the pres practice sandbox is the place that i can risk anything and and it's part of the game um but in the chat uh not so much i guess i guess um but i think the thing is this is interesting because we're for people who are seeing this seems like to me very much this is going to be a chat i guess just assumed it seems like it's just in the way we started oh yeah i started started to talk about my colleagues and then you know bad things about them but then i i think what you said is like really interesting to me because like when like earlier you said the word container for the chat and then i immediately associated with um with the sandbox but then as you said it's not something where we risk or how do you say it like it's it's not like um i'm just like trying to really picture like how sandbox is like like as an adult you don't even if you have the sandbox there you can you know sit around it but you won't really play with sand or you don't you know do crazy stuff like kids like that's what we would do in the practice but that's not what we do in the chat and it doesn't have to be the sandbox like it's it's a container but it doesn't it can be on the grass or it can be in someone's apartment what i think i like is in a way because for me like the sandbox is more like a global i mean i always like think i have to think directly to virtual machines because it's what i learned like so then i will think in container and in images you know like like then i would think like an image will be more like a an image is something that just you start uh it's something that is temporal right is uh like while the container is something that uh for instance two images cannot be if two images are created from the same container they cannot be on at the same time because they will be initialized from the same container so yeah sorry the image is the how do you say the running the insecurity i think image is the executable in a way of i don't know i think i'm mixing but i think in practical terms because i was working with data this year is like you create a container from the virtual machine and then from the container you need to create in a way an instance that is the image is the one that will execute this thing so a best practice invert in this case in docker that's what i learned in docker is like every time you finish if you know that you're using different virtual machines you just erase the image because you have to recreate a new one and if you don't do that sometimes the image stays open and that can create conflicts because they will use part of the or the port or something that stays open yeah yeah yeah no what i found funny is like because you said image and i was really slow and i at first i thought like the the picture like image like this but then like why is it called image like this docker like now i understand and you can say image for you know like linux image like if i if i think in image like i think i don't think it's like what i think it image is for me because now you're mentioning the image back it seems to me it's a screenshot so it's like it's like a slap is like a is the picture of the the of the moment that it was created it seems to me that it makes sense like from where it comes from at that moment uh no i think it's actually opposite because you can run an image and you can take um not a screenshot but like a snapshot like as um kind of you know where where you can go back like not maybe not for docker but for example like database i don't know or file system actually um like a copy that where you can you know point where you can go back it's like a snapshot so image is like more like how to say dynamic alive to me wait i found i found this that i found this from my things so it says like images versus containers says a docker image is an imo immutable so unchangeable file that contains the source code uh dependencies tools and other files needed for an application to run the container is a virtualized runtime environment where users can isolate apps from the underlying systems these containers are compact portable you need some blah blah so the it's the docker is what is running the you is an immutable file that contains it is an immutable file that contains the source code dependencies tools and other files and needed for application to run in a ways like the it it seems to me like an analogy is like when you in in processing or mp5gs that you have you first you you initialize everything and then after you have a loop you know like i think i also see in these programs you have to basically assign resources of the computer and then after you run the loop of the code what you need to do so the first one it just does one time and the second one is loops and so how does it relate to the image i don't somehow i see that you know that in a way like the docker that the container in a way it seems to me it's like the setup and the image is like the running environment i don't know now i'm getting more confused because i think this is something i try not to like think too much and i you know i never probably properly studied this so but i just like generally found interesting like how they called why they called image because again i don't think it's actually a screenshot or snapshot but image can be you said it contains no not contain image is like like source code is yeah it contains source code like all the libraries dependencies it's like the wrong time environment no no it's not true no it's like is the file that contains the source code libraries dependencies tools and other files needed for an application it's like the source code it's basically the source code is the image wait a second i know i don't have dropbox i know dropbox virtualbox um because on the other computer my desktop i have the you know the virtual machine like literally like runs like virtual windows and sometimes i use things in the practice because they also have but i think the image is like what you select to to run i mean an image yeah literally an image like yeah like because the virtual machine will be a square no i don't think even i don't think the virtual machine is even the square but the square is already from the image itself you know like the square and then inside you put the windows or something yeah i don't know yeah could be no i mean it makes doesn't makes it makes sense that the image is literally from the moment that you start singing the image that is the like the virtual box image no i think i'm i'm confused with image and instance or are they the same because instance is something that you know like gave life like for example in the programming like when you you have a class but class is just abstract thing that is not running i mean this can be a static class but then you make an instance that actually runs and you can make as many instances as you want so i thought like image is something like that i it seems to me like it's something like in an image because you can have different images from the same container yeah yeah yeah if the problem that it happens is like then normally the images then if you know images they stay open so you need to like best practices to close them because they will use specific things from the system of your computer and then every time anyway any time you need to every time you start the virtual machine you need to in a way recreate the instance so because the process hold i remember from docker was you have to build the image right the code is you have to build build and dot and then it builds the image and then you run the environment but it seems to me is it's kind of like the same of an instance because then you can put different at the same time but then you have to specify and that could become very messy which port are you assigning because that is scaled very fast you are virtualizing different kind of things and then the poor they become super messy i was thinking like what does it mean to have like two practice instances at the same time to practice i know it's not possible because the resource is really limited that's going to another dimension but yeah it makes me think like that means to me like going to a different dimension like to instance the practice to create an instance of the practice i mean that's what we do in the sandbox like well but that's kind of more like a metaphor of how we do it like because we're in the center these topics are like if people are fo for those who are following this we are so sorry this is no this is so narrow like we are just speaking about coding terms and we're not even an expert in that so we're just like like we're just like rumbling around like yeah i think so but in the practice that could be interesting like so like basically can we do two two practices at the same time or like suspend one practice and start another practice with a remaining resource yeah that that actually that that i like that idea like i think conceptually because i think that's the difference ah no or not like when because from instant instances i mean i don't know so much like low level computing but like from when i work with instances in java or in javascript which are not really classes because our dnr objects but anyway are classes and they try to work like that that you don't really assign like memory of these kind of things i don't know how is in c-sharp and these low-level uh coding languages where you need to assign memory and these kind of things um what i'm think what i'm saying that is because an instance it doesn't go so level i mean you don't go so level insane to the computer how much are you assigning from memory from different resources of the of the computer itself but it's just more from the code it's just it's just it's a core it's a it's a choreography or is it a way to structure the way how the code has to uh trigger things in different ways but is not related exactly with the resources um and then we speak about the practice i think the idea of the resources it comes very present what i'm saying is like a practice is kind of like a really low level computing in in a way when we have the resources there really at the core um but maybe like can you do practice while having dinner i mean the day i mean having dinner is not yeah it's true i did it no but that could be interesting i think i think this experience i think these experiments could be interesting because like does that mean that is that a practice that's why the question when arriving being i was telling you and actually now i can reframe it differently because when i ask you what are what is the minimum things that we need for a practice to happen and i was talking in terms of resources but now actually after experiencing the impulse dance and seeing that actually even one time we didn't even without wi-fi for instance uh that was unthinkable for me before now i can say that kind of like introduce the question again as an open question like what are the minimal things for a practice to be a practice and that could be interesting to think because it's not it's not and now i'm not referring about resources but more about elements if you want to think from more conceptual uh building up that would be interesting to think what are those things that are necessary for a practice to happen but is it like something concrete or like tools technologies as elements or something also about ourselves but i think that's the point because when when i refer about elements it's just everything that you sell and more and then at the same time if you put like i'm plus on that then you have to think on grouping and ungrouping those elements so then you can think back to objects and encoding wise you know like basically grouping and grouping these objects and yeah yeah because big yeah tools they are like they have multiple levels i mean even in the computer but it also depends how we see things like if we see the thing on myself uh sitting in my in front of myself as computer than it's a computer but it's i don't know like a block then i mean i can also you know run around this block like well not running around but i was you know jumping around this block when we're at impulses but now i think if i do a reflection like from my side like after experience also being with you and doing the practice in the cafe in the cove in the social space in the cafeteria you know with not public but with people around and then after on the studio focus i mean with people focus on the work then i can say that in a way i see like the practice it can be i can see it as a space where i can be puritan you know like puritan or like purists or like you know as in the the practice for me have like because for me it's very important like for me it's very precious the practice to get the away from my main consciousness i really like to get away from this thing um so since that's really at the core for me like to just be dance again and to just leave this main consciousness uh then i will say like i could have one puritan state that will said like the practice is the space where i can do that so and therefore all the elements that i select are those who facilitate me to do such a thing but on the other hand also i can think as more critically from this thing way of thinking and say like in a way that's that could be that's in a way is limiting the practice uh because it just means that for i mean if i just think that uh i don't know wait so i think in short it like could be in one way like seeing uh in a puritan state where i'm trying to select elements that can facilitate the self-dissociation that's one and in the other hand in short is [Music] a practice that is no bound to anything i think right in a way like these two i see it quite different and they conflict in a way so so for the first one you you meant like you want to curate so that it you can be in that state in that practice but the other one is other one is that you have like not no control but not the entire control but you have you can do the practice in a way yeah more more in our i think more close to what we do you know so far like just more just dealing with everything at this same time and frustration um but this is actually like i was thinking about what klaus said um to you um that according to you like he said something that we should do it at least like three hours or something to make it as a performance and then you know like we already talked about that um if we do it for three hours then at least three hours people will get you know the idea like used to it that they don't have to attend like watch for the whole time right it's like breaks the um how they say it's no longer like a viewer and performer relationship right right right that's that was we talked about that in the context of how people receive it but actually it will be super helpful for us as well if you want to like this you know self-destruction and stuff like that you want do you feel oh yes okay okay because because of the viewer public is gone because of the yeah the space is the stage is staged public is gone yeah yeah yeah yeah i mean of course it depends on the audience but if let's say there are nice audience that we want to engage with i mean we don't know but i think it's interesting thing to try if we have a chance to do it but what i think is interesting you know obviously you're saying there's a contradiction in this because what we're talking basically in a way here no maybe it's different thing wait let me try to organize my idea is that when we try when we did the general rehearsal [Laughter] when you did the general rehearsal next to the canteen in the impulse and right under the sun and then there were people there were these people from the laureate workshop they were next to it i think they just finished this version and they were next to it like seven people talking with her and we were just doing our stuff what i think is interesting like in that space because it's a public space there is a i mean i think that's more like uh that there would say let's say there is not a clear intention of there is something happening i'm saying from the from the public no actually not only from the public but from our from my point of view it's like let me try to reframe again so if we start from like the the talk the performance hybrid performance we did uh and saturday i had dog d in this in the in the studio right then we have audience we have public let's say people were that way looking at us and there was so much expectation of something to happen we know also we acknowledged there were some people else right the space was the configuration of the space ways like that in the space of the general rehearsal which was outside in the canteen they say these people from the from laurea arya's workshop were talking about something it's a public space so we basically we are just sharing the same space just by chance these people are talking we are here rehearsing what we are doing and nevertheless because we do some i guess we do the practice so i guess under view sometimes it's like these people are doing weird stuff then um at the same time they will just keep on talking you know they will just keep on talking but from time to time say like i don't know maybe you do noise i do know it's like if there is more at trying to call without intention but if there is for some reason normal way to call the attention of somebody else these people is normally they will react you know it's like the same as if you are talking with your friends and then here there is a couple and then from time to time they're fighting and then they will just put their voice loud so it's just normal reflex to just look what is happening and then just but you come back to what you're doing because you're busy with something that is more important to you as public in that case and then it's like talking with laura about their workshop and dance i don't know and for us it's the same sometimes we will feel their presence and like it's a bit uncomfortable but then we come back you know it's a bit uncomfortable but then we come back so in both cases like we are sharing the space um so what i'm trying to say is like in that space of the in that public space this idea of the borders are blend between the public and the stage in that in that case of the general rehearsal it happened because it's not because we there is nothing there is not a clear intention we didn't talk with them like guys we are going to do this here do you mind we maybe will be loud or something there is no there is no negotiation there is no expectation of anything are just humans who are to there to share the public space to do what they want and that in a way is like what when we when you spoke about like this idea of to blend the borders on the stage um yeah it's just in relation with that that in the public space it happened um [Music] i mean it can happen i don't know yeah because i cannot imagine how it is just go to a park and do it like because that was at impersons no but yeah i think maybe i think what is missing of this that i'm saying is i think and then we can quote again mark martin and use what he says about you know like the difference between like an image and just an image and then he's speaking about like nevertheless like this he used these words of like it's like what does he say he said like it's like minimal interesting art is like an art that lingers in the threshold between exciting and forgetting and it engages just enough to hold the viewer but it never interfe intervene to say what is their exciting or what not nevertheless and that's what i'm here what i'm trying to say that nevertheless it must be art it must be delivered and proposed as art because otherwise it's anything and i think this is what i'm missing the in this thing of the public space what i think is missing is like they don't know that this is art what you're doing somehow you know like if you put the configuration in the back again to this uh studio then already the proposal is understood as a choreographic proposal so already is within a framework that is art nevertheless we are trying to propose for the people to be free and do what they need to do but we are not trying to i mean but it's kind of like clear that we are saying is like yeah do whatever you want but in a ways like within the contract is that what we are proposing is artistic is not whatever is whatever within an artistic framework and i think that's uh clear in that uh yeah it's very limited niche whatever no because it exactly has to be whatever but whatever within under i mean it has to be clear that is whatever artistic whatever somehow otherwise it's anything otherwise it's anything you know then maybe we can rephrase or like relate to the previous question of what's the elements that we need for practice as what's the what like whatever-ness of practice that i don't know i don't know how to put it in the words but like what's what is the whatever in the practice what's the border i like that question what is the whatever whatever let me practice yeah because it's not about i think this is because it's for me it's clear that is not so the question is what is the whatever in the practice understood as the practice uh which i think is more an open question and it's a difficult one because i an easy one out where i will dare to say it's more easy to answer what is the whatever in this practice you know yeah yeah uh because then i will say like i don't know i think i can i can speak for myself like today i was trying to play with plants and i don't know i have a new framework of javascript and that was my whatever you know like this in this practice but the whatever in the practice as a practice is something that is more abstract right i don't know what um wait how do i relate this um no i would say no like it start to feel like this is like a stress test of the sandbox like you put in lava or like you put in like you know antarctica and see how the sandwich survives and then i thought um do you know this machine that like rotates and like a huge machine that i think they have temperature control maybe and also like rotates uh many times to see like you know if you put like a gadget inside if you produce these things like to do a stress test like how yeah how much it will stand so it's like uh that kind of machine for the stress practice practice or sandbox could be like just like another idea of like not like because i don't want to say like kind of push the boundary or like push the limit because that sounds like we're really like going further you know like advancement kind of feeling but if we say like a stretch stress test of best practice then that sounds like you know um how do i say it i think it's more playful i i like the image more yeah the stress test um yeah but actually because in the last days i have been since i have this cap like i just came from the impulse lens and then i'm i'm quite straight i mean everythi i saw like two days ago and elena and she was with some people i think from somebody from las valencia de la bay and other people from like dance community and they were asking me like what do you do and then i have this stress test very often like i mean in the last days where i like to also to go uh and then i just kind of i get i think i'm getting better in the way how i handle this in bit in between saying like phrases that i know by heart from my research and things that i appropriate from the research and also blending between something that is soft because sometimes let's say if i will just have the word then i will just go long in like memorize sentences that i know they will work for a conference or for a talk but then i may i can i can i'm getting more sensible when i'm speaking with somebody that that doesn't work you know that the person is not a robot and i'm not like otherwise i start feeling that i'm patronizing and then i can see myself like okay this is not nice how can how to blend this in something that is more joyful but still it says um something concrete that's what i'm saying because it says something that is concluded still because i think that's what is interesting to share this with other people people will be will be interesting interested but then i also i'm trying to give something concrete you know like is this you know this is is it is this because you cannot just practice every time what you cannot just do practice every time every day i can understand i cannot start practicing my practice like you know sorry i i cut your so i cut your you talking with this video but oh i didn't optimize what video but basically this is the thing i was talking about this machine that you put the phone or something inside here and then it starts rotating for stress testing it's called roller drop tester and you can buy it on alibaba for this kind of price so if you have a huge budget for best practices maybe you can get it i don't know it doesn't make sense but um sorry what i wanted to say uh to what you were saying was because you cannot like meet everyone and just like show like one hour of practice to them no that's why you have to somehow tell the truth well not not the truth but something that goes in between that you get your truth your truth my truth sure yeah yeah yeah no but i think also i feel like the because the stickers i'm almost running out of that i can only spend like 20 euros every time so it's just not trendable so what i thought actually i'm gonna do with the sticker is just like like half the double of those stickers because now there are just one per a4 and now i think i want to make a design there is just a small letter so then i can make two stickers basically a small letter and then the qr is still at the same size and i think design wise could look well because it still is like kind of the same with this which is small from far away that is still people can recognize it so i think i will try to do that like i was wondering like well i think it's nice with just one hashtag but for example we can also add another hashtag and then that part can be like different for each sticker like if you print like one sheet can you have like different hashtags on every sticker i guess because then what you're gonna what but you print at the end of the they're going to charge you per cheap per sheet and then it's great and then yeah and then we cut it yeah yeah but then it can be kind of four should be like 34 or more than 30 hashtag plus let's say yeah 34 times so it can be like a collectible item like a pokemon yes kind of like this uh we should have we should have printed the one with the imprisoned hashtag so it's like a you know limited edition best practices hashtag impulse dance yeah imprisons 21 or something [Music] i i received a your magazine by the way okay quality is way it's way nicer like but it's it's bigger also i i'll be honest i i like more this size it's more practical but the quality of this is is a it's very nice yeah i can already see it yeah yeah the paper is like the the color of the yeah it's nice so this is this is officially one of this is from autumn because he's my mentor officially under my school so that's what i have to do officially my school is give this to you one of these uh but they screw it up here also because i pay for these two so i pay for these two things eight ninety euros so it's expensive but um then yeah so now they missed out yeah they might have this should be like you see the white thing yeah should be here not at the back you see oh i see the white should be there because the letter should start there you see like the m should start yeah just screw it up um but yeah let's practice because i practice somebody had ideas in the future than to have to have a new version like not for the school but to have a version that is functional uh that's that's the idea um by the way i also put the and a link i don't know the website if you saw it like maybe do you do a half host can i have can i share this uh wait a sec ah this is annoying i think now we can do it yes so then i did if i go here by the way the i like the your books uh back cover like with the code like hydra code on it it's it really looks nice when it's printed yeah i think i think it was nice i like eva helped me with that also because then we put it the in the front we put a a black thing to not mess too much if you see for example the front and the back is not the same the back it has the code but the front it has a black uh layer to not make it too messy with the white thing so it was we spent some time designing that so you see i hear i put here like academic papers okay and then and then i have put here uh laureate disease which is my disease let's lower it and then here then you have the link to the to the magazine and actually but also is more thinking towards the open source thought that we start thinking also in terms of like even the content here people can download it the content and i think i found that this is important from i i bring this back from dnl so like the idea like just let the material go it doesn't need to have like the property of like ownership just as long as it goes some people do something it's it's it feels good yeah i totally agree yeah i mean at one point i just decided like not to think about it i mean it's same for the chat like one at one point you know like i mean not at one point at first we thought maybe we don't publish or we publish and then we just started putting everything online and we just keep it doing and it's actually like it's like when you just put everything online it doesn't matter anymore because no it's not like like one thing doesn't stand out so you don't really feel you know you'll be ashamed to release this chat okay yeah because that's what somebody was giving us a feedback like the one theater maker from berlin that she a friend of an elena she was saying that that she found so beautiful like to go to youtube and see because i basically i just she just used the hashtag so i actually never said to somebody use the hashtag in youtube but she did hashtag it in youtube and then she found your playlist and and then she was saying that how beautiful it looks like you know you see all this content and then she was referring that how nice it just it feels to have all the content but at the same time it feels like because we were talking about uh croatian uh curatorial processes and how that uh box the process in a way sometimes because you're when you're doing curatorial processes then you're then you have an intel a clear intention towards that you're trying to make something out of it in our case for instance she was speaking from her because she's a filmmaker like she but that's what she studied and now works with theater doing ascendography and stuff like this and she was saying that the then she will refrain too much herself to what she published so it's going back to what you're saying because then she will try to publish good stuff but then you have so much material and when you're working with film then you have to deal a lot with addition and that means time at the end it's a pity because it's like you're slowly you're holding your back so much because you have so many ideas so many expectations of what you would like to do with this beautiful material but at the end you don't do it because you always you need more time and more time more time and i think it's a nice way to to not care too much about one and one in one hand also but it's just to put it out like in our case for instance we said like when at some point we decide to start doing detail this also because we realize how so there is not too much information it's good to somehow that if you go to internet that you find some reference of things that you can see um so to in a way not initiate but like just allow this like just the the dialogue to happen between technologies and dance because it's not too clear it's very mike it's micro niche at this point so what we do i think what i think is interesting from what we do is that it goes beyond if it's good or bad because it's the best uh but it goes beyond that because it's actually just more than the intentions to put it out and to actually for to people to speak about it so if people will come to say there is bad or if people will not say anything about it i rather will i feel better when people will come and say there is bad then somebody that then nobody's saying anything but what i'm saying is like it's better to try to contribute to the dialogue because there's no dialogue so then just to putting ourselves out then we just we contribute to the dialogue uh for people also like i think i was saying this uh quite a lot but uh like when i expect something in like i say contemporary dance performance i don't expect that is you know good or bad but you know is there something that we can talk about like if after we watch that which is i don't know it's not a maybe it's not a good perspective to watch performance but that's kind of like how i yeah evaluate if it's interesting to watch or not by seeing that like is there something that after watching the piece is there something that we can talk about like let's say in the chat because if it's just just beautiful then you know that's just one word but if there's something you don't like or something you want to change in a different way or this worked because i had this context but it doesn't work for you because you have different contexts like these things we can talk about and that's good and it's that as you said in dance tech it's always well like often falls into beautiful or not or pretty whatever this very short like it's just about aesthetics or i think the conversation actually is stuck in dance context or tech context and it's nothing but better between yeah in between or something that includes both yeah that is true but do we do it like it's best practice something that we can talk i think it's what is good about what we do or what's what's best about what we do is because it's something we can relate it's not like a crazy technology but it's something that is like zoom or like video call something that everybody can do in a way you know you can relate but also it's not something easy that it looks like you can do it but if you want to do it it's actually quite complex it's that also thick people can see it in that way you know like it can be interesting for those people or maybe not i don't know what what i think is cool is that we this is very i mean this in a way this is very cheap like uh like just you need to have a computer and as long as you have a computer then you can do it then you need the internet and that's it there was something that was like i was i saw something that i think flor was having some interview or something in instagram some days ago so she was live and then i was by chance like there and then a guy was asking her about i think it was something about the guy was referring somehow to that you need to have equipment and you need to that is expensive and this is partly true but at the core because i'm just putting like for what we do because depending you know like yeah for what we do just we need a computer and it as we we did the practice in the impulse then we have a performance in the impulses with uh from what what are the specs of your computer you have a a surface computer from service pro 6. i bought it on 2020 but i think it's from 2019 i5 8 gig ram and we did and we used to practice and we did the practice with with your computer so like as long as you have a computer like not an old computer you can do it um and then of course it's different let's say if you want to research about projection mapping or like i don't know like 3d graphics is different like yes then you need different tools right but i think for what info and what we do uh is so far not expensive um i think we are very flexible with that well i don't know no because this is like a to me it's not like a resolved thing like as i'm you know experimenting with hydra inside live lab like i really want to push this if we want to do like a workshop i mean specifically i think i'm thinking like a milestone um for the ccl that you know where we can like talk about it and actually do it in like a few days to you know not everyone but everyone interested in this can actually try it you know hands-on and in order to do it i cannot expect i mean maybe people gathering there they have good computers but you never know what kind of computer people bring and i mean for the workshop idea i know like we have different ideas um one is like something like along the practice or something more another one is more conceptual but let's say we do something like a practice or we share the practice of practice then we really have to think about yeah how to keep it lightweight and anyone can try uh because that's i think it's nice and um and it's also like we use a lot of open source tools and that's how we can contribute back to the community not just using it and not just fixing bugs but to actually share it with people and i think actually that's something that i guess that's what i was saying that i came back with this uh consciousness of the open source intention within the practice because um this is something that i can start thinking or talking or writing also in terms of uh concept to evolve with the practice you know like for us it's just the content let's say content how the content is being distributed to the net and and these things but it's along with the open source mentality of uh an ownership let's say i think it's i think the the talk is or is about ownership shared ownership and and this kind of things and and i think it's something that in our time is slowly we can start building up you know like how much how much we give and and how much how much politically engaged because this is in a way it's going in that direction you know on like how much politically you get engaged uh which are the flags that we start carrying or not because i think i'm saying this because as long as we have a sandbox then the chat will be a sandbox still in that in that case i will see the chat as a sandbox as long as we have a best practice sandbox as a project then anything that we do around there is a consequence of the practice it's fine you know say somebody we give the project with somebody to do footage uh film footage what's called found the phone footage or the project of a workshop or different kind of thing with the publication of a book like going to do like super serious or commercial things like could go in any any direction and i think any of these actually aspects can happen as long as we have a sandbox um so therefore therefore like speaking about something more consciously said about have more opposition towards open source or certain topics in the world that can't be possible to happen uh out of the sandbox because i remember at some point i was having some problems with my own identities or something i don't remember even when um when i have this one of these crisis and then i i think yes when it happens this thing with colombia and then i was feeling a bit like local sided you know because then i felt like in one hand i feel like as colombian that i should say something but at the same time i feel like as a practice as part of something very internal to me that in my pr in the practice is you know like back then i will have a different thought because i will see it completely don't i wouldn't know where to put it let's say now because i'm speaking like this i will know for instance that i can do something with this outside of the sandbox it's still as a consequence of the practice you see what i mean like while before say like before what i'm saying is like that i can set our i can have a position as jorge and from my own uh identities i can have a political position um out of the sandbox basically yeah as a consequence of the pro and still in connection with the practices you know you see yeah i think it's i don't know if i understand correctly but it's not that the sandbox is affecting you directly because they are in the sandbox and they cannot reach you but you are observing the sandbox and that's somehow you learn from the sandbox is that what's happened i don't think i follow okay because you said the practice is affecting your like how you i don't know think let's say but that is that what you said basically what i'm saying what i was trying to say is like i think what i'm trying to say is that let's say in the example that i was trying to put it like before when these things happen in colombia there is something that i wanted to say or do within the practice but because i understood the practice as a period space then you can go back to what i was trying to use the puritan space then i will not allow this to happen then and i would be very drastic because that's kind of my personality is a bit like that i do go party not sleep like not like oh on or i'm very very uh drastic and uh too much discipline it's difficult for me to be in between so in that example then i i guess i did not then i was feeling somehow like kind of like conflicted because it still is something that is really coming from an important place on myself so that's the the place for the the the what i'm trying to express comes from that situation and i'm trying to connect in this uh spirit of the open source or the political position let's say uh now few weeks after could be even months after that because now i understand that out of the sandbox i can do that but before i didn't know that before and somehow i thought it would i will i guess in a way i didn't understood some kind of limits or boundaries of what is the what was the sandbox i guess in a way like now i can understand even abstractly because i guess the image of what is a sandbox is different for you than for me but now i can start more confident that i can speak about uh open source or have a more a political position uh in a chat or in an old place and not feel that i'm hacking hijacking the practice basically so you are afraid of contaminating the sandbox the sandbox i was afraid okay because normally there's a space that i will be more puritan like pure puritan like that will go like that space is pure it's not for that right yeah yeah i think so like we can talk about anything and then sandbox is still sandbox exactly and i also think the projects i think that's the beauty that was talking with this woman from germany i think that the beauty of what we do is like because as long as we have the sandbox other side projects and things that are more serious you know said like money money-wise but also politically like different things they can go on as long as we have always the sandbox that we can go back and then just do as we did in the beginning right yeah and it's also yeah because it's because we have the image of sandbox like it's not in a way it's not pure it's really well it's not artificial because it came from the practice but we didn't again we didn't plan to build the sandbox but we found that in the practice but the thing is what i use like in following this that you're saying is and i'm repeating this when i talk with people in different ways but is this this is like the the practice for me is like the promise of something yet to come every time what we practice i don't know what is it but there is the promise so the sandbox for me is a promise of something that will come every time but i don't know what is it but i know it will come so and there was something in the book of one of the books of martha i think it was from martin or somewhere else the thing was martin he was saying he was saying something like um yeah no i put it in my own words in my own words what i said is like we know what are we doing and that's part of like the that what i write in the magazine we know what we are doing we don't know the shape it will take oh the result will have but we know what are we doing and that's what i said in an email to class when he was asking what do you guys need i said like could be everything could be nothing like we know what we are doing we don't know exactly what is going to happen but we know what we're doing so it's in a different words to say like i know so it's the promise of something yet to come with the practice every single time i don't know what will happen but i know it will happen yeah it's i don't know if that okay did you learn like async and promise uh in javascript yes of course yeah because that's i see it like you know it's not yeah it's like a metaphor because the word promise is like the way you used it and how it's like used in javascript this is so so yeah i understand from where it comes is absolutely that because i promise the promise of something that is it has to be fulfilled at some point yeah and it's not like it's not like c or c plus plus or this other most of the languages that you know it evaluates from the top to the bottom or it can be loop but it's basically from top to bottom but javascript is like everything is um not synchronous so it can go like anywhere really and the promise is something that it's just it's there and it's evaluated but it's it's going to wait for the event that's really awesome because in because in like you have in javascript also you have a weight and a sync that's like the advanced version i mean they you have promises and then from promises you have to use then right promise then i promise that something will happen then do this but then if you want to make your life more i guess easier because these promises can get so in cluster and in functional programming you can get so so because i did functional programming in the last semester and they just get so twisted in the way of the trigger and then like when you use a sink and a weight is uh is in a way more logical because you say like uh so it hold where it works like and i think function works within the weight it's like yeah you need to have an await in the async function at some point you said you have to say wait you said you declared a sink and then at some point you said wait yeah basically basically you wait until that function finishes i mean obviously that thing function finishes so it's like see that you know go from the top to the bottom like you never skip like this function it's just running and then you skip to the next one it never happens to see but in javascript it's always the case that you know you load a file that will not wait for the loading to finish to make going to the next line and that's why you need a promise or otherwise async which is more you know natural for us because you can read it from top to bottom right yeah um but promise is more like it gets really scattered and uh but it's in a way like it's more like a practice kind of way of doing it because you know you you it's kind of to me it's more like you leave like agency there but then what is because then our so then is the difference i don't see the difference between the promise and then the singing function i don't because because async await is that so let's say like one of the like most probably like used is like uh you load uh file or you load the data from other you know server json files yeah that's a json file and it takes time right so you don't know if it takes like a fraction of millisecond or it takes 10 seconds so that's why like javascript usually skips it until i mean it doesn't wait until the file is loaded but it goes to the next line and that's problematic because you want like for example you load jason and then next line you want to refer to the json but if it's scared it's not there yet so that's problematic so i mean like for us like logically it makes sense that we have this await a sync for the lord jason so the next line only happens when jason is loaded so everyone's happy okay so then but then it's only so then it works like that yeah yeah so the async function will happen only so as ink function then awaits uh it literally waits there the execution of the code but then the promise is you have the lord jason and then you chain another function as you know in the promise like then do this then do that but then i feel it's more interesting because it kind of you know like leaves a possibility there and anyways you skip to the next line also because you leave messages for yourself not like normal then yeah they promise the promise you have like yes and no and then they know then you normally you can define how complex you want to give a message to what was the error what was the no message so it gives you gives you some feedback of what was wrong in that right yeah let's see it's like something for the future whenever either if it works or not we don't know but and what kind of data we get of course we don't know that's why we throw the data right but then it's then when somehow then they are saying function anyway it's a promise it's something that but it's more rigid let's say okay let's say okay but let's let's agree let's agree there is a it's because i still have i have i don't have so much experience with both but i guess i got more used to just like using those things so then uh it's a it's a a rigid a promise function because it promised that it will execute once something is uh arrived yeah i mean like i think what's confusing is in javascript there's an object called a class called promis yes and that's like that's separate from async i mean it's promises yeah like so i think a weight does you know it's like a promise or yeah i don't know what now i'm really confused with the word promise but it promises you that it only the promise is like at the core because i know what the core at the core is just is an object because javascript basically isn't everything it's object and then you have a primer how you call this object yeah i don't know what's called but like like like like like numbers you have the different types you have types on numbers you have is object types and and a sink anyways an object uh with different uh properties uh right and and then a promise is also an object with the possibility of two uh object functions yeah object functions well i think it's just a keyword right it's actually like a function anyways like i don't know where we're going i was thinking i was thinking do we want to go there i was doing this like uh this how you call this bootcamp of javascript the last year by the way i lost the subject anyway and i have to do it again then i have to do it again this year but normally i was doing that when i met you i was doing that and then i was like i passed all the theory of of this thing of uh so like the theory is very kind of clear more or less the theory of where for what it comes from um yeah anyway so let's go maybe yeah but just to like wrap up i think it's like also with the sandbox idea like there's quite a lot of things that in programming we can relate a lot like you know how i see like why it was a promise oh yeah because of the practice the process happens then something but it's not something that's beautiful but i think it's beautiful the way how you make the relation because it's absolutely when you start speaking about that i thought like yes it's very much like that i see like anyways it's the promise of something yet to come it's like literally if you use those words in coding to teach about the promise i think is very a promise is the promise of something yet to come it will come as a as a as a negative or a something will happen you know for for yes or no yeah even even if it doesn't happen it will send it's a note exactly yeah yeah that's true there will be a no yeah and then you define no so if there is the promise of the something will happen with it yeah and it's so like funny like sometimes this like simple word like promise is so complex in programming and but we talk about it like you know we you know it's it's something natural like if you're coding you know if you you can talk about uh types or whatever that's like really simple word but when it comes to programming it has it carries so many things yeah yeah because i got at some point i confused i also remember when you know like a function like like the function of an object is not a function but it's a you know like a fun it's a function but at the end it's not the fun the function of an object is called different it's an i don't remember now but it's not a file i mean it's it's not a function it's called differently the function of an object and and then you have a lot of this the i think what i think is called from javascript is that it's so messy so messy but it has that's why it is the language of the web because it has all this asynchronous possibilities to do things and so many politics in the browser and so many ways to interpret exactly those yeah yes or yes at one point like i think it didn't it was not recorded but you said like uh olivia is like living example of best practices yes and i really liked it um and also like you know she goes a lot with javascript and i think that's there's like a lot of connection in there because i feel this messiness of javascript and how it's connected to our best practices like in both ways like also as an i conceptually like messy but also we use a lot of javascript in there and also you know how olivia's um yeah like basically all her work is like on the browser or with node.js all this javascript stuff and she's like really good at like um how do you say it like not duct taping but she makes the code that you don't know why it's working but she's a good cooker yeah everybody's asking me when i felt like when i think about peter that by the way peter uh answer so he wants he will join i guess in the coming weeks one of the chats if peter if you're saying hello um peter is some kind of like a purist like he's somebody who really thinks poetically about code i would like you guys also like to met because um peter is somebody who really thinks in a way like functional like this kind of like has more like functional programming to coding that uh is somebody who really tried to text he takes really the time to make the when you see the code is so clean like you know like he's always trying to make of course at the end it's messy because depending how much people you work but like in seeds for instance you see what we were doing like he's always trying to reuse functions and functions and functions and functions so he's trying to make like always a poetic with with the way how he approached the his his the coding the way how he sees that um yeah in this topic i think it will be so interesting to have uh peter to talk with us um yeah i'm looking forward because i found i found what i found interesting is like in the practice or is that how you can make the analogy in the in life basically from [Music] from this from this like so serious and gigi uh topics you know that how you can actually make some sense out of that in in in life yeah imagine someone who doesn't know javascript but like listening all the way until now and trying to connect it to the like it was funny but what's funny is like we thought at some point we were saying like what would we start saying like when we start we started like like going on and on like but yeah but i promise yeah but not up not totally because these and then this and yeah but no because of this and then you can go over and over and over and over and because i think um i don't know about peter but i think there are two kinds of programmers i mean most of the people are like you know it works then whatever like i'm that kind of person i don't know what actually promise is but other kind of people that really cares you know all these specifications and you know how things work under the i mean i i have to say i know a little bit into that direction than you know average programmer i don't know maybe it's not safe to say that but um i care a lot more but some people are really serious about it and they can just you know say explain what is async and like promise okay so maybe so that we have the promise of something to happen is like we will have somebody will give us a good explanation about how the pro i think and away promises like peter stayer will be with us uh we will have a good uh down to earth uh talk about there and then from there we can start our poetics actually that would be so interesting to start a conversation with peter like welcome peter to the channel can you please share with us what is up and a sync function and what is a promise and then from there just start going like oh my gosh that's next level um that's super cool that's super fun it sounds like super fun all right so okay maybe yeah we should maybe just close the chat here and we go to backstage so thank you everyone for watching uh please like the video something like like subscribe we need yeah maybe maybe you get the sticker if you like the video that's not possible we don't have your data yeah maybe like maybe yeah i just like we can't think about it we can make you we we are we are uh goodies deans we are yes we have yesterday we lots of goodies we have a lot of goodies uh stickers caps t-shirts we have so many goodies you guys have no idea so like yeah grind us and then i have the official program from inputs there's so much you guys like please just contact us we will yeah just subscribe and in the next videos maybe we do like campaign no i don't think so we should start like we just actually what we can promise like if we have some interaction then we can start thinking to be motivated to do something with it right yeah just just write in the chat what what uh oh yeah actually that's something i never said you know like please share in the chat what kind of goodies you want yes this is one of the best practices yes yeah yeah then maybe it will be realized this one day i would like maybe like best practices like uh i don't know yeah i have to think yeah yeah all right banana best practice banana miss practice banana okay best practice banana okay yeah goodbye thumbs up", "fExStCywwd8": "happens all the time it happens all the time it happens all the time the important part is not never recorded okay is it recording already it is recording okay so hello but we don't do proper introduction we just say whatever that's how it works so yeah that's the last day of now last day yeah last hours [Applause] and yeah [Applause] talk about hacking all the time well because you do hack the festival yeah yeah yeah we should actually show it in the camera so we basically printed this that looks exactly like other well not exactly actually looks like other pages to advertise our showing of the symposium and they like it so they didn't post it in their own they didn't uh add it to their social media but they like it meaning that they approve it so much like this kind of thing right like if everything likes your post like it's like acknowledged and this is what hacking is there is a there is an area where you can add something to create something new i would say like to put something on you but i will add yeah so something that you create but it's not for me something say that something that i created is not for me but it's aiming to give agency for other ones to express and do something that they to become something that is not defined like something that i don't know what is that i believe there can be something well i think it's important to add and not to take away it's not that you ripped out a page true and changed it you added we also did something like put the sticker on one of the posters and that sticker was removed [Music] after a few days so there are some boundaries like what they say fine or not because that was kind of damaging as well it's something sticky maybe but you again you didn't rip a piece of the poster or or crossed it out you added something yeah with the opportunity to remove it and re-establish the original so i think if you just comment out the piece of the program then it still works right it still works you don't have a bug you just add another layer so i think that's the positive before we started like we talked a bit about hackathon and i'm like a little bit kind of like this you know i i'm not really feel comfortable that this term is like i kind of called it yeah something more institutional in a way so it's like a you know we do a conference we do a symposium we do a hackathon exactly which i feel like you know this hacking element is kind of lost i agree and this is how our conversation just started because i was just invited to join a hackathon as a mentor and at the end the goal is to present some proposals so there is a defined goal of this one you have 48 hours and at the end something is supposed to happen yeah i don't know if i'm super comfortable with with this pressure and institutionalized okay but like personal and also sharing yeah but it's not always like under like some kind of umbrella does it need to have a goal that's that's so that's actually what i really like the reason why i stopped participating in hackathons is so much pressure and the ones who win is not the hacking one it's like the most boring idea that people come up with that wins the you know the is there's a war even the concept that there is a winner and an award at the end kind of exactly yeah it's violating some things and other things and who is to evaluate that again and we're back to what does evaluation how can you evaluate you're saying something about that like that you're invited to speak about what you you worry about oh yeah it was just the beginning of a discussion so in the sciences there are certain ways of how you evaluate impact usually citations from papers etc how do you evaluate impact in the arts say here we're in a performing arts space how do you measure the effectiveness and i was looking into it and there are ways and there are surveys that you know the audience can take to see if they have an emotional response to it but is this what what drives the artist very rarely right are they doing the thing they do or are we doing the things we do because we want to have a positive reply on a survey or excitation and i'm not sure if here the sciences and the arts are driven by the same so i'm just at the beginning of thinking about this this is very interesting because like uh so peter from seats uh he didn't start starting this plc and one of the focus of his phd is about evaluating this process the impact from that and i have this short conversation with peter and they're like sorry but i found this is just so impossible that wasn't just but it's it's how the industry works because you get the funding if you can prove that you have social impact that you have a mark in the artistic ecosystem so there are these two kids and measures to evaluate this but but it feels like it's two different this junk there are the artists that do their thing and then there are the institutions and organizations and and that influences i think the artists because they can only get the funding to do the thing if they meet all the criteria and it's it's a cycle that i'm i know this from the scientists i criticized it so and i thought that the arts are free to express more freedom but not if they actually what i think is like as long as because so this is like a problem that already we see but i think as long as there is a space for other things to happen then still the research can go on like this thing can go on as long as there is a space for experimentation but i think what's funny is we're talking about evaluation yeah and our project is called best practices so there is something about best and worst perfect i'm gonna go back to two weeks why did you call it best practice i will ignore everyone why do we call it these practices because i mean what we say in the paper is like let's say like now conceptually what we will set is like the best practices so we do not assume or say that we found the best practices but we rather imply that is true practicing is to practicing is one of the best practices it's true uh through the practice itself the practice itself becomes one of the best practices so you said it's not like i think it's the promise of something yet to come and i like to say that because i believe in that i think again i'm saying there's this thing about believing is the promise of something that will come but you don't need to know what is it you need to find the space to go there and repeat over and over and over and over and you don't need to know if it's good or bad but just you need to complain yeah but just by calling it best there's a certain amount of pressure to join it because it has to be the best no it was more also it was more i guess one can say almost like marketing in a way because it was something that it literally came from an inside joke that we started saying that we started working because at the time i was working with i was learning about best practices in coding and then we started talking about dance and then the best practices yeah so it was just something that came out like as an inside joke the best practices in contemporary dance especially all these comments like classical like dance they kind of have best practices like what kind of form what they what is considered the best but contemporary dance is kind of opposite because that kind of didn't work so people try to find something on their own and not that there is something there is the test so are you hacking classical dance or contemporaries or like what some people would call it like like a kind of a post dance you know like a dance that is something more than dance itself something that is not yet defined where these dots come into play so if something is being written now for us and other people who are pushing the boundaries and how important is this for you in the best practice that it's recorded that you have a legacy or record of it we i mean we at some point we've decided everything that we will break that we do we have to record it and upload it online because it was clear to us that the journal of dance and collaboration is very very immature so we found that it was very important to develop a language uh that we and other people can use so since there are not more references we thought it's part of our contributions to both the practice and the chats not because we said this this is this is the thing but it's just because we contribute to stimulate the discussions collection of recordings your archive yeah so but then also so this is archive and archive you think in dances like archive is a record of the path and that is a recording of the pattern it's stored in certain structure somewhere but then we also think we try to uh play around with the idea of like creating an act of archive which tries to not stay in the past but then in a practice sometimes like in the performance that i was saying like when we did here uh then we will use archival material in a current practice so in that way then you reactivate that archive that's what we try to do with an active diver but we when we started like we didn't really think about making a archive just as you said you know just recording and then upload why not upload it to that we said we said it like you know if there's something wrong with it we don't have to upload or we can edit it out or something did you ever edit but then we never it never happened for the chat we decided to have like uh the chat session to be uploaded and the backstage where we can talk about some random stuff any practical things or bad things about other people so sometimes actually when we start doing the chat we we're going to find that it's a chat but at some point we said okay this is a backstage because maybe we start we go to live into some place or is this a backstage right now no this is the chat so but i think like something that are very clear in our practices like we have the practice and in the chat and the practice is the place that we try to do an exercise of self-dissociation in a way so the idea that by practicing i am trying to get out of this main consciousness that is okay right now with you and also and just try to be something else that is not working which is impossible because it's just something that you have to come back at some point my identity will come my judgment will come but nevertheless it's again about believing is possible and then insisting in the format so that's one thing the practice space for self-association so in other words it's not rational and in the other hand you have the chat with the chat we're going to enjoy the chat do you want to join the chat we're recording i need to go but really say hi to the camera if you want if you want why not hello okay sorry so then you have the practices like say the practice is the place that is like not rational and then you have the chat the chat is the place with the time with two of us and sometimes we guess like you we try to rationalize what is it what is that that just happened or what is the thing going around so the chat is a rational exercise the practice is a non-rational exercise but it works in somehow because the non-rational space is grounded and somehow it becomes something rational that other people can interpret uh yeah what's going on during this performance did the two meet the rationale and the mom right now because you had an audience yeah so you had feedback but that was completely different because it's the first time that we were doing this so at the end because it was the audience it was really hard so then at the end we have we said it was a child but at the end it ended up being quite more like q a kind of thing [Music] so let's say it was not so close that normally we will do a chat um and i will say that in my personal experience the exercise of like self-dissociation was not so easy for me because i was doing from more people yeah and because i was dancing in the influence i'm a dancer and so this exercise that i do in my house now in front of a camera there could still be an audience no doesn't that change something can you just associate yourself even though you're being watched but i think we i think i feel that i'm comfortable already just with the camera so i have no problem with the camera uh so because we have been doing this for more than one year once per week so it's i'm used to that but with the public or with audience it was just the first time and so that i could it was not so easy for me to do your next best practice be different i think we we use we said this idea of like a sandbox you know that in computing like what a sandbox is sandbox [Applause] can you explain that in short yeah so for example like in a more technical term like if you want to test like computer virus for example but you don't want to test it on your computer because then your computer will affect it so the idea is to inside your computer you make a simulation of your computer for example and then you can run the virus inside and that's central yeah but also i think what's important in the sandbox is that from inside the sandbox they cannot reach outside so even if that simulation is infected with the computer fires it cannot do anything to outside so we are always safe yes and that's what we do in the like what how we think as a practice is that when we do the practice we are inside the sandbox so that's different from our personas for example and it won't affect our lives well it actually does but it's not like directly like changing my personality for example and let's say like the pressure of this kind of pressure is out because because then for reason like we have other ideas of if you want to do uh say like push the performative state more or the writing more or different aspects more then we can do it but still we always will have the sandbox that is the space that we develop and that we find pressure to go back and forth when it starts so the sandbox is very important for the president so can you deal with failures more easily when you say it's done with failures but i think like because i don't really feel like it's difficult to feel i never feel within the sandbox i don't think it's easy to say if we fail or we succeed because it's just it's everything and nothing at the same time i think and the way why i feel it is that i am beyond oh and i'm just trying to it's like an escape right fine and we speak about this thing that is like a if i stop doing the practice for say two weeks two weeks because we're busy once we do the practice then we talk afterwards and we said it like it's like some i'm addicted to that space because it gives me so much freedom [Music] but i think that's how we think now but when we started i think we had some kind of not pressure but i think we found something failure like for example at node yeah like when we really try to use vr space and mozilla hubs and try to do something kind of like good we were face design and then it failed and it was a fail that was the first time that we met the first time that we met in person was in frankfurt in this festival from node forum for digital arts and then we were trying to do something good for quotation marks right and then we failed but because we fell after that then we realized actually we just lose just between the pressure and then we understood that actually there is nothing to win or to lose and then from there on we did not kind of prepare things but we just we assumed the failure as part of the practice also so either the failure or the win there was just one same thing there was nothing like a there was not a clear intention yeah succeeding let's say [Music] nice that's really good i mean i i feel like in the arts i really value failing and or yeah and any kinds of horrors and mistakes this is where i yeah i feel really free to to do so so everything in science is not so easy to fail like it's there and i i wonder if this is because it's the thing that pays my rent or if it's something intrinsic to to the difference of science and art details yeah yeah yeah that's a good question this is this could be so true in bodies [Music] i mean we are terrified of making mistakes publicly usually although you know we have to make more mistakes openly i mean i think especially in sciences you you have to make them public before the next person comes up our like field like this idea of dialect is built from western culture on the search for the truth basically is then and this is something that you can perceive in a place like buffer it's a place that it has a lot of phds and people with a lot of knowledge and coming from academias and all these things it's normally the conversation that you will find is people who are really always like ready to convince you with argument i'm right and you are wrong and it is constant like energy of like like showing that i know and you don't know so i can write very much binary yeah so and then then we go back to this idea and then the glitch in spaces like that is very important because it doesn't matter like if you are right or not it's i think it's more interesting if there is if a glitch generates over their space if the glitch hacks the conversation and becomes a party [Music] the glitch is something that [Music] but i'm very interesting like because like what you say like in science is um the answer thing is because like there is some so much money i guess also is involved in research so then i guess like aiming to fail or like just uh have the possibility to fail is not something that i guess sponsors want to conceive if you are doing a research when you have to use telescopes i don't know like massive equipment for astronomy and then you say like by the way my research i might fail and not show something well okay that is different that's risky but i feel like so there are places yeah that so if there's a high risk high impact and then we're back to what is impact okay we measure that and then that might get okay so risk is not the same but then already yeah okay because i think there's a difference in what we speak in art because in art and you know uh and what we speak then we don't know we are not speaking about like a concrete way to uh capitalize the risk but for sure something will happen good things will happen yeah exactly i think there's just the same amount of even more personal impacts in the arts because the expression and the touching of someone experiencing the art is priceless i mean you can change lives and we forget how the social impact that art can have and the warning system that art is if it wants to be it doesn't have to be you also say that it doesn't have to have a goal it can just be an expression it doesn't have to happen but but is it because then in science then you will like okay is it because in science it's more close it has to be functional somehow and in arts in a way like the research is more at the core or i mean what is more we kind of like accept or it was introducing the way how we perceive science that in a way science has to be functional yeah creating an understanding is functional then yes doing an understanding yeah creating an understanding adding to knowledge okay i think that's the core of research okay to understand the world around us a little bit more okay and art has a similar role on a more personal meaning for many years maybe you understand the world better through your best practice or you understand yourself better through your best practice well then that sounds pretty similar yes well what i found kind of toxic in science like especially when i was studying engineering well engineering is not science but let's say yeah something around there um it was really binary like you know you should do this method you know this method doesn't work but it's really like um yeah like we talked about but then i really like i didn't really study neuroscience but um i was kind of in the crowd at some point and what i really like is it's more fluid i think in the past it was more binary like they were thinking like some part of the brain or function like um like responsible for this function and that function and people try to understand that way but then they started notice that uh because of neuroplasticity and all this development it's actually not that easy to define so that the research method has to be also fluid yeah i think that is that it's the case more and more and that's the power of infant transdisciplinary research when you just add methodologies from other disciplines so i don't think it's as binary anymore on the field but i guess depending on the field and also yeah yeah neurosciences fortunately they are not connected to arts but for example dance music yeah that's like recycled really related to the coordination of the body um so maybe that's where we should go next what next was neuroscience to go to go to links to freud's schools like to go to psychology psychoanalysis now like but it's funny because in our electronical they have absolute joe these artists that are working we're going there so he was telling me that in the city like the psychonauts is very very very dominant it's very it's very visible how uh influenced things around the city because you study in a school in linz [Applause] [Music] somehow there is this tradition oh earth should not be here like indiana i think the thing is something that is very the austrian though probably because he lives he's from belgium he was telling me on his experience studying there that he feels that very you feel it in the in the atmosphere and the way that you study and the way we're getting seeing things and yeah what is happening here now that everyone's leaving i think they have workshops constantly so they sometimes they are like periods with everybody just finished come here to have some food and then they just go [Music] i really wanted to try yeah but i got my souvenir what is it there's a bicycle inside yeah there's a little bicycle inside [Music] [Laughter] [Music] i keep thinking that bosch makes breaks but is that really true or they make everything you can make big mistakes that works for washington he does um self-driving cars oh wow self-driving cars wow [Music] what are you asking why are you crazy are you crazy what are you asking me [Music] oh no they asked me how many followers do you have on instagram no they ask you fortunately we have 20 no 265 followers on my youtube account yeah which this will be okay but maybe we should close the chat here yes and then we can do this tonight we are going to see a performance right uh so thank you very much please like the video like the nails like your nails thank you here too ciao thank you allah from vienna", "J1CZQaN45CM": "hey we're back after we were kicked out by the middle of the deal and then you're not supposed to see it in the grass oh you you heard it yes the guy was super gentle yeah it was fine then we came here and we had the chat that we didn't record obviously we have a chat that was a conversation frankfurt it was really nice actually if we recorded like like even like five minutes in that chinese party we have to go back to that chinese card just for that just to have a chat yeah something to maybe we'll find something in essen yeah but it's different i mean essen like where we do it is probably like out of the city because it's like the industrial you know so it's like probably like you can be middle of nowhere anyways i don't know we talked a lot so basically we have this we have all this content i mean we have been talking the whole day about the medium in relation to our content in relation to the medium that is being spread or which medium is uh used for the content right in different ways so the medium and the content in different ways we have been talking about the whole fountain and on videos basically yeah he was saying that this found footage which is like you don't know who it belongs to like old films or whatever you don't know where it's from and then you can reappropriate to yeah do something and i think it's kind of interesting it's really related to our not yeah what we do or what we want what we want to do yeah we wanted to work to create like a one of the visual content that is yeah so like to work with the content within the content that we have already and create an artificial piece that you can use as such as such well like we i for me i see found footage in like different ways one is well actually for this one is like we can use other people's footage which we kind of do sometimes like i did a few times especially with like dance pieces and then also our content can be the footage to be found uh what else or it can be more abstract um this methodology for other people to adapt content practice remix as a practice let's say but something i was already talking about is what if we kind of make the our because we have a whole bunch of footage like what if we make it anonymous somehow and distribute it you know it can be traceable but it's not immediately like labeled with best practices then what's gonna happen what people will do it or but it will be a shame if they make nfd fortunately i would be fine with it no that's not really the point but then the question is how can we make it anonymous how can we make it how can we distribute it the footage yeah because if we put it online then it's obviously that we put online so one way i was thinking is to burn you know dvd or sd card or whatever probably no one has optical i was thinking who is using these days like cds like optical disks but this could be actually a thing what if we burn it into floppies for example do you have no i don't know because then because of they will be barely possible because how heavy are the videos so that's something we have to think somehow we have to compress it into small images or videos or you know something that can be put inside a floppy disk and distribute it then you know not many people can read it no then stop the material then is the opposite of like visibility because the material gets stopped no because i don't think the distribution of the media has visibility in this case because it's more about a performative act of this or that yeah the performance or the let's say artwork itself is the distribution yeah if you frame it as such then you can distribute this action as something else yeah but then i agree or not but then i think like the i will say rather as a cd than a flop it is because the cd is still like not so many people have these things to read anymore right uh and it's still so it's kind of like it's not going so drastic you know going vlog this is very drastic yeah i think i said it would be nice and i have a machine to burn like five of those i would say this can be like different projects because if we think about flow feeders i don't know how big is it that's that means that's less than 200 megabytes because i remember like sony made this huge digital camera they still quarterback that saves on the sloppiness and you can take like three photos i think there's no more than 250 megabytes no it's like a few megabytes yeah not like no not even a few hundred wow but then what what makes me think or what i think interesting is how to compress the data of practice or whatever into floppiness and still like meaningful in a way no not like that i found i understand that it's interesting but i wouldn't use that medium to share with people i think that's more like a special case not for some specific uh occasion then yes but not not as the act as the performance to go in different places it's 1.2 megabytes [Music] that would be cool to bring something like that to you now you know because then you know in a crowd like that somebody might find a way how to do it you know right so if you if you give away 10 or 20 if at least one two person they do it on their own then it's just successful or you feel like at least somebody will do it and it's not in a random space in a space like that and i'll say it makes sense like the object is special but we can also think like because floppy disk is such a interesting object in itself and we can like print stickers as well on the floor if we make it as a kind of souvenir then maybe it's something else and then still has data but you don't have to see the perks yeah i don't know just saying okay the other thing we would like to say is that um that we didn't mention that i have my notes is about going back to what we did on saturday is um the idea of the these days you heard and you can see very often in different places online that people talk about hybrid performances uh it's kind of a trend i mean because of zoom like now like not hybrid understand like like using technology different ways like uh but it just literally is online and offline that's what they meant with hybrid festivals that's very uh very much that was the case of the iwe right there was a hybrid festival and they promoted as a hybrid thing and then when you do what we did it was hybrid we don't really think it was hybrid but it was just something that we can underline in order towards the idea of visibility you know we consciously said there's a hybrid thing where it happens online as always but also there is the performance that we just mentioned before in the park this performance quotation marketing we can just like not define but yeah like we can define our practice as those with those words but we are you know detachable i mean it's just a name [Music] what i found interesting isn't the word itself you know it's like because it's something that i don't agree with people say this everything because it's not hybrid it's just the way whole people yeah we have we are getting used to these offline this hybrid space [Music] and we find another space [Music] the festival itself it's always [Laughter] it was very very nice to be invited the people that have more than contact with uh so class super thank you because he just joined last night he did the best like to try to let's just imitate what we were doing [Music] i will see you in brussels um thank you very much", "Jugg51NvrnI": "all right hey hello hello we are silhouette we'll be back we're back in the shape of a silhouette in the building museum in vienna in vienna vienna we are still in vienna last stages now this is going tomorrow we're going to germany yeah tomorrow night with the night train i did it because no one i was trying to buy from wednesday anyway there was no option they were full already oh but in this one there was a possibility so i thought okay 30 euros more but then i just wanted to try i never tried that so curious [Music] so what happened when was the last time we talked like chad was with lisa i mean i actually uploaded the morning chat today the just no no video live today yeah okay yeah okay so you did it already yeah ah okay that's the name before yeah so basically i added the color bar oh yeah okay it's already there yeah so this is like a second chance of the day yes maybe we can talk about what we did for like [Music] that the foreign part was it felt like a performance somehow right right i mean the practice part the practice part because it was the first time we shared we did this with public right it felt somehow as a performance yeah i mean at least like well there are two things like how people received it and how we felt i don't know or something else yeah and we talked about it like wait was it i don't know if it's a recorded part but we talked like performance like we can frame it as a performance i mean we can sell it another performance this format over practice but we can keep it as something else i know what we said literally because i put it here is it yeah somebody can call it performance but it's just a practice with more elements within the concept that we build so if somebody needs to call it performance they call it performance but we just we know that this performance is just a practice with more elements so their audience the audience is also another element as the pixel the computer they delay my body your body yeah the audience audience yeah but what can it be we also talked about like there was i think maybe some one something that we can mention in that regard is like there is this idea but class was mentioning that uh about duration original time the performance must be durational like long length more than one more than one hour i think at least it should start from two hours on you can go even longer if you want depend but what is the configuration but i think the people needs since what we propose is something that is there was also this idea we shared his career house party workshop that we were part it was basically a workshop that started from 9 pm goes home in the morning and the idea is really i think he was saying that institutions institutional spaces in other words more like i think to soften institutional space i think there's a more uh a word that i think i feel more comfortable with to make it less rigid so they were one of the elements that i thought that we could use perhaps uh i just like the idea to soften the space through simple things uh so it could be like nail polish then you know what it does using it is [Music] [Music] and this time like definitely came to you know try it out which was quite nice because that is it's subtle but it's like audience being part of the yeah okay right but because of because there are so many elements it's necessary the performance in this case takes a long uh longer format that i think at least should start from two hours and we can even extend it and i said it before but it's important like not like not it's not our task to suggest you know you can do this you can do that but they can kind of feel it but that's why it's exactly the time because we are not suggesting that you should be free or something it's just through the space itself so we speak about this very often about that give back agency to the viewer through uh long streaming formats so in this case we'll be give back agency to the viewer is through long directional performance so in the case of the video one of the main aspects is because you have a playhead so they can decide when to go where to go all these things yeah but in this case it's in the space so it's just the people in the space decide where to go within the space and how how much attention they want to give to this element that element and so on i just really think because you said the playhead like what would be the yeah okay thank you so we have to stop it here and you can put it together uh yeah somehow i just like to stop here and we'll see like we see next year because we could not do this here you're not supposed to put the belt here in the frame in the frame it's like a disneyland yes okay let's do that see you in a bit", "Mk8egbXcDmg": "okay finally no i i just wanted to like record the sound are you using the sound of this recording through obs or something okay but then you're using them and um yeah you can do that in real time yeah that like it works as an audio interface cool it's somehow like before the trip i think i replaced the battery almost yeah but then now the battery is gone this is something i thought about you know like when we were eating at the restaurant you were recording a sound at one point maybe a breakfast place wasn't it oh yes i said but i sent that to you yeah i got it i haven't listened to it that was the breakfast that was breakfast yeah because like i think it's super nice to eat and chat but it's hard to record it with a video or like a good you know because it has to stay long long like long is like when we have there's so many times we have this happened in tranquil before like i mean at least now we have also we have done already some chats but in frankfurt it happens that we just have these conversations that are so nice right and then just we lost a lot of them yeah it's not that everything is lost because it just comes back in different ways but because we just sitting and talking it's basically it's just yeah it's gone like now like so that was i started to think like i should just record it yeah yeah like because without video you know it's hard to upload on youtube so i was like oh should i do it or not but then if you have just sound material that's also fine but else is good because we just become we can still upload it in youtube which is we have to create an mp4 file yeah but then if you want to watch it on youtube well because it can be just something that people put in the background i still i think it will be still interesting to just put an mp4 file there in the chat i would say we can try everything like do it doing there and also like we can have like best practices soundcloud soundcloud i like no i like the idea science best practice is soundcloud soundcloud cloud yeah because that's what i understood and i like that yeah it sounds like a launch it's not like a cool thing let's practice this soundcloud and then we can invite people into more good things without you also you but that's why more like the idea of the audio club so i like this kind of look it sounds really cool you know like a launch area i see no but that's that's something like i thought about like no it just like reminded me of something like maybe i told you this already but uh at the schools um how to say it like we had the outside space during the festival city festival in cologne and we had like one week for the school to do like installations and whatever in the space uh it was actually quite dusty and shitty place in the like really the under the under the bridge the bridge yeah with a train not humid but it's just dusty okay um and you know cars passing by all the time so it's quite noisy yeah and trains passing by as well but then what i want to say is i did an interview at one point with the lecturers three of them and i just that one was with this microphone and the camera and i you know edited it so that it's uploaded online which is cool and then afterwards one of the participants she makes music which is track maker dj and she also has a project at the school like a radio um like every week or something like they have like different hosts so she's doing it maybe monthly or something and for that edition she did something about the festival like she did dj during that week so used to use that material and also she asked everyone to contribute like just some kind of you know not the interview but you just talk about the experience so instead of recording something new i sent her the interview material that i did with the lecturers and sadly no one else contributed but it's good that i did it because she what she did is the spoken words like she used the um the sound track in the background and these spoken words are like not um like it comes like you know like it's like a sound piece it's not like we're having conversation but you use these extracts to make it more like yeah it's hard to explain it without listening to it but then it's basically she makes some soundtrack of that yeah with the song with the you know the music and the the interview yeah she like broke those you know conversation into different pieces but still it's like a sentence yeah um which is really nice it's like you know made me think you know we could also do that use the chat this process chat in the practice in a different way we like we use it sometimes you play it sometimes we we played in the impressions today yeah yeah that was cool it was by chance i didn't plan yeah it was just the next track right like suggested yeah yeah so that was cool and it's good that i did upload it like yes yes yes you didn't upload it yeah yeah yes so but also like we can for example like you we can work with a musician or a sound artist yeah to do something a little bit more than that could be also interesting yeah you're almost like uh at the influence of the one point you're saying that we should have a dj that's right we should have some somebody working with sound that will they will release yeah because i mean we're doing this youtube thing but they just would be so nice and kind of if let's say if you're doing a performance or something there will be somebody in charge of doing something with someone yeah because that would also introduce an element to us exactly that that is surprising that we have to adjust to that because basically now what is it like i i decide what music to put or you decide so it's like basically one is ready and the other one is not ready so i think there is an asymmetry in that in that thing you see what i mean well if the music is coming from other plays then just we both will be in the same position like okay now something is happening with this and the music is uh the sound is is is very once the music is there it's super strong now you start dancing with the music without the music there is all this dramatical thing depending up uh the music so it's very very very dominant in the space yeah also the way how you move how you feel it's so important but about sound i really felt like during a symposium they were like sometimes projecting zoom call on the projection but then you won't see it like if for example this kind of workshop kind of presentation where people are moving together and and then you know like people joining from zoom like from online they were also like you know trying to do something together but this doesn't really feel to be in the same space right if it's just like a projection also that configuration wasn't that good that project the screen was a little bit higher up not close to the ground which i found it's kind of weird but then i was thinking like how annie any abraham's the lady does that this practice with um also with daniel they closed eyes for 15 minutes together but then they asked everyone to unmute for the whole time so you hear the environmental sound which i don't you don't know which person it's coming from but i think it's a nice way to connect yeah the remote people so that i'm saying this because of the sound that we're talking about and i seen that in connection what we were talking before is because there is there's a way that i think it's about the ontology of the medium and then i think it in this case in the example that you're putting with any i think it works is because said if you just put the people just to meditate uh might be interesting or not but i think what makes it special is that you you said you're gonna share the space and you're meditating but the whole time this is you open your microphone uh so if you're watching and you're following the the practice you're not gonna see anything right but you you will hear what is happening and i think what is interesting is that this is like the zoom call is an audio visual thing right right so now the visual thing uh but always i think we are visual people like that so most of the information that we get in terms of cognition are uh uh processed through visual information and the sound somehow what it happens is in somehow is that it's like a granted thing you know like you will you won't really recognize um wait let me try to not get lost with this because what i'm trying to say to the exams yeah what i'm trying to say is that humans i think i think humans are very visual and then when you put them in space to share the to share that space like the meditative space in a zoom call once you close your eyes and then you are just hearing in a way you can i think you can connect in in a more deep sense with the other person which is uh in the sun called then when you're talking with somebody i mean i think it's yeah but so when you're talking one to one with somebody soon call with video and sound right you already are used to that that the medium is like that so you you agree that the medium is like that i think when the two people are closing their eyes and they start to meditate at the same time listening to what is there on the other side i think they break that first understanding that the sun call is a video called so the ontology that's what i'm saying like the ontological uh this ontological speaking assume is a video called uh platform so when you when you deny the vid the visual thing and just making an audio thing it allows you to in that case and to connect in a better way right better or different way at least i would say that i wasn't not better but i would say is more uh strong the connection is more strong it could be but also like i wouldn't point out i completely forgot which presentation it was but there was someone saying that like we like this visual um sensation is dominant but that's like really western male kind of idea i i forgot who was saying it but like if we think about decolonization that's something to the sound isn't the one thing that you can think of yeah and also like i started thinking how can we use touch or smell or things in the practice that's because i think this that you're saying is so important because it's a way how you can hack the like or the life or things that in the western world is because since there are so many conflicts and many of the companies they are is because of uh a visual representation so difference are because you can perceive them with your eyes right so if uh sound is a easy way to pass these things because then you don't see you don't see the difference in that then the difference that you will perceive will be more with sound so is it's a waste of weight at going through sounds and it's a practical way to decolonize knowledge i think it could be yeah it could be i will not say knowledge but i would not know it because it's not true it's not knowledge but it's not information yeah that's i think i would be rather subscribed more to that idea like since the idea that humans are visual is some conception that comes from western world that we assume that we perceive a lot of information through our eyes then with sound one can decolonize information somehow or try to decolonize information tomorrow because that's about information it's not knowledge it's just information you know you're talking about gears about information no i don't know i i need to i don't i cannot unders uh not understand i cannot answer at this point but it's also like made me think um oh wow like now i really feel that with the microphone like the tone changes a lot you know like how we talk by the way oh yeah what i was thinking is uh p5.js like processing you know like javascript version let's say the community is like pushing accessibility and one of their main accessibility project is to have text or like a spoken representation of the image so that blind people can work on it as well because it's processing or p5.js it's so visual like you can do sound with it but mostly like you draw images and they mainly have like two approaches one is to make wait what was it how was it i think one is you write the text annotation in a sketch itself so you just describe what it is and the other one is to understand the canvas with some kind of algorithm like which part of the canvas is filled with what color for example okay it's not very practical i would say it's completely different than processing in a way it's different than processing what do you mean like because what you're saying is that so this is this this is some uh to speak uh what is happening in the these cameras yeah yeah yeah instead of the visual representation so like that's i found this really interesting like whether it works or not it completely changes the medium yeah that's what i'm saying that's what i'm saying that that's not processing it does not bad or good exactly but it's just that's not processing yeah uh it's and it still is processing you know because it's within the framework so yeah then ontology is different it becomes something different yeah i mean we also had this idea i mean one of the professors well she actually retired already but julia she told me that you know i should make like a narrate the practice yes which i'm still interested in this idea i should do it we should do it happen we can do that and we can live within the arsenal we can just watch what we see i just talked and you're still okay yeah we can do that we should do that because then we do we are together yeah we should do this because we put it together and then you start watching and talk at the same time but is it like a performative talking or just chat no this is the chat i think it's just chat we can try different ones i mean not today because it could be very different but at least we need two hours to do it yeah i wouldn't i wouldn't even like concern too much if it's a performance or a chat well it will happen like it will come not naturally then you will feel after you finish like this is more close to a practice or this is more close to a uh chat yeah or this is something new i mean it is new because that's what what i have done i was sharing with the with england that that i go from what we do gladly surprise is that this that we present here this practice that's on the sandbox that this is something new this is what we did with the people that's something new i wasn't expecting to to have that as an outcome but this is close to a performance thing yeah yeah totally uh yeah so so that's not the practice that we but you and me do that sandbox stay like that and we'll stay like that forever you know the meeting that we have every week and that will stay like that i guess forever because it's the safe place the sandbox um well for me like the the eye of d was something [Applause] hard to say like i mean it is something new for sure because it's not but for me it's not a performance but it's not a practice but it's you know like something like also like it's really transforming during the practice itself it's not it's not a particular thing for the whole time but how i based on how i see things like at one point i was looking at people the audience and they i i had a feeling that they are just there as kind of a prop of the practice then then i really feel that okay i'm in a practice mode that they're just there somehow like we just you know there are computers they're people but then at the same time next well not the same time but at one moment i felt like they're watching us why why are they watching us and that really makes me feel that i have to perform i mean not have to perform but i naturally come to more like a performative what i felt what i can say like i can say it in the relay that regardless is that at some point i have this feeling of um like being comfortable in the sense of people are there that they don't know what is what is happening and in a way you you are you're comfortable you know you feel like this is happening you are in my house basically that's the feeling that i got like you're in my house and they are like really not scared because when they're watching they're not scared but at the same time they don't know exactly how to behave or you know mostly i didn't even know how to behave um then i felt um very comfortable like uh i mean this can sound a bit like how how i would i would put it in in a performance state like if i'm dancing and then i i'm all overly comfortable with what i'm doing okay i started to think like it can be i mean it can be framed as a performance but at the same time in a frame of performance like in a program of you know like festivals performance but we could do it completely in a different way that is because i i i said it that the audience was a kind of prop but we can also play with this like what is the audience like like for example like you know traditionally dances on the stage in the theater but then nowadays they do a lot in the gallery spaces museum spaces it's you know people like in and out and something is happening directionally yeah that's kind of completely different medium and in that sense like we can explore something that is we say it's a performance but that's just a word and what actually we do is exploring something i mean okay we do it already so no i think maybe if you can finish what you're saying is that so we said it's a performance because somebody needs to call it exactly but then for what we think is it's just a way to explore the practice because if you you see this is what i mean it makes sense so when we go there actually it's just a way it's just the only thing that is different is like there is people so then it's just a way to explore the practice in a different configuration because and then it will depends of the space but at the end is the same you know it's the same practice but there's public they're just let's say they're just new elements there are new elements in the play yeah so it's not the same because there are new elements and it actually like in a way it's expanding or going to but but the core is the same yeah but the core yeah the core is the same so somebody can call it a performance to put it in somewhere in the paper but then for us it's a way to explore uh practice with new elements basically that's nice it's very nice but and that actually really relaxes a lot but now you understand ah okay so um somebody said like when is the performing person at some point daphne came and she she said like so when is the performance and i was like no it's on the performance you know like now if i understand this then i will be more relaxed and you can call it that i know what is it you know yeah i don't have to politically correct her no i mean it's kind of both because it's easier to frame it as a performance but also like i correct it all the time because it really affects myself but that's what i'm saying that's what i'm saying like because that's why i correct her but if i know that what we do is somebody can call it performance but then i know what we do is just have practice with more elements yeah then i don't have to correct her because in my head i'm like calm down it's just it's just a practice with more elements because you say it in your own words could be you call it props like i could call it differently it's just in in in the contextual background of the practice are just elements right but then if you go further how the audience can be [Music] equivalent of pixels elements um that's that's the question because then it would make sense if they are somehow involved or not i have two things to say that so because i want to put the question so how the audience can become pixels yeah i mean it doesn't have to be exactly pixels but something equivalent i mean in a way what olivia did with like everyone becomes like cursor yeah that was quite nice just saying no but yeah so one thing that i have to say is like the thing in a way like how would the ho ho i mean this was implicit we didn't spoke about it but in my understanding it's like you and me when we talk about what we have to do on saturday we basically were denying the public it was never spoken but it was implicit we didn't thought about the audience because we didn't want to get that pressure uh but that was implicit that's my understanding right now we didn't want to take the audience into consideration because that's such a responsibility right so but so that's one thing but the second thing is what it happens in the space is that we engage the public sometimes at some point i remember i don't know what happened you sometimes share some at some point there were some small interactions with them like i did one i remember you were doing something that uh freaked me out a little bit and i made some emotion or something but it was more in relation with them because they could because they could see you and they could see my reaction also and i did something that in in that regards in communication with the audience okay and at some point also you communicate something with the audience so we did a small interactions that were not planned but just they came natural they were small into interaction with the orange so we did not deny them but so what i think is that is cool is that in a next step could be that we can explore the audience then perhaps could be let me look look at this perhaps and next performance if we have a space to do a if we are inviting in a place perhaps the next one that we could do is like consciously try to explore the audience in the space in that sense i think it worked that i brought nail polish because it was definitely like she was somebody was painting her nails yeah yeah that was definitely yeah that was uh i thought it was really nice because somehow it connects also like we had the you know printouts and stuff um that it's a little bit like directional but it's something we could you know explore a bit more how they can use it it seems to me like you know what like that we kind of kind of uh could try to hack chris idea of like this queer powerhouse party yeah in a practice basically that makes so much sense you can talk also with him in that like just talk about that because it's just it makes things so easy and also if the performance also going back to what class was saying i think the practice in that performative state let's say practice performance needs to be have a long time for the people to get used to what to understand the space basically to get comfortable that there is something for me just to have a a queer house uh spirit without us defining without that without us telling because like what we want basically is to that every element so you and me and them and the rest of the things are equally right but until they don't chill the out then it can happen i mean will happen for you and me more or less but they won't chill out so they need to say it it's gonna just break them no you cannot just say chill out right now there's something that makes a hierarchy already it's no we demand something no so but then it has to be we can hack the spirit of the queer house party in the practice say nail polish work very much yeah could be other things also yeah that would definitely like because we need just to soften down there is nothing there to understand you know that was the thing people were trying some things to understand you don't have to understand something i don't know why we thought we could try to understand afterwards but not in the practice just paint your nails move around do the hippie practice that you were doing before all is good oh yeah that's actually all it's good always some people were doing that at some point some people were doing some contact dance thing okay", "uwWDDK-OI2Q": "okay so thanks for being here and sharing space with us they're special for us because this is the first time that we do with people actually because the practices we have in our own studios we do this so maybe i'll just kind of start somehow talking together to define what is this so i say class introduced like in short best practices is a framework to practice a queer form of communication between technology and body so the story short story is like in april 2020 during the first lockdown we start meeting weekly online to practice for an hour to stream the store and alter the videos of ourselves and each other another important aspect of the practice is the chat there's basically this time the practice is an irrational space in a way we try to do consciously an exercise of self-association maybe we can go together in that aspect and they challenge the cognitive process we try to understand rationally what is that but in practice i try to get out of this main thing that is me right now uh that i realize this is is not too easy with with people right now i realized it's difficult to get out of myself very good learning process so along with the practices and chat sessions all of them are recorded and uploaded in youtube and we do this to create a massive online archive this is very important for us because we believe that the field we believe that the field of dance tech collaboration is still very natural and in its early phase so the dancers choreographers and coders they we need to develop a vocabulary uh to develop a language rather than using superficially technology in that species that's why we said it's a queer form of communication it's no dance functionally for technology and it's not technology functional for dance to make the nas look better say projection mapping other dance that's functional and it's binary it's functional let's say that's why we said it's queries everything in between the two spaces uh you know that's it uh yes uh so basic practices is a framework where the medium in warsaw mcluhan the medium is the message it has governance and agency in itself where the content is void of meaning shaped and morphed by the mediums ontology it lingers on the threshold of exciting and forgetting so it holds the viewer just enough but i never will interfere to tell you what is there for you to see we are not trying to impress you um and yeah it is we think it is potentiality in itself it's the promise of something yet to come every time that we practice so we do not define beforehand the two of the things that we do that's why like we don't apply when we plan this is yeah we try to do not define the things before and we deal because part of the practice is like technology is very unstable so we just to deal with it and just go through it so this is like the short like kind of a text i wouldn't define that as choreography like i if i define no i wouldn't define it to do something like that okay if it's said can you elaborate on what to say if i said something for one hour i will do something easier with my body i don't think i don't think i understand what you're saying it's okay okay um maybe we'll try to define together what is uh what do you guys see or what is this rather than doing a q a we kind of have this inside joke that we see like q and o like questions and options because we don't really know what is it so we have all this uh research that is this is part of a thesis that i was doing a bachelor for multimedia communication technology where naoto was my mentor he has more knowledge in technology than myself i come from dance and our components are working with technology now can i say something i'm here yes it felt like contradiction in terms in a way when you say let's divide it together where me to try to define you if i understood the word i think i i am very comfortable with what you say like completely we don't really know well thank you very much i was very much interested in the in how you deal with images and the different layers you offered so i saw at least what i saw is different layers and the funny thing was that i had a feeling you go kind of through the screen so as if i could see you from the other side of the screen and that the blurriness of it is a nice way to reflect on questions of archive and dance documentation so at least i understood it in that context and i thought that was very interesting thanks yeah in that regard like i can say that we have at some point this in the childhood now we said like if you don't need it please do not show myself normal you know like that's we call this native being naked just blend something don't put myself in if you really need it for some intention to do it but normally don't show myself blend it somehow because i don't know i might end up naked it somehow protects uh somehow i feel that we are naked when we just saw myself like this i'm trying to get out of this felt uh in the beginning it felt like very kind of fragmented and very casual the movement everything happening somehow like scrolling through a facebook page or whatever you know like and once i had that because i was questioning myself what's going on there and once i had it kind of formulated in myself what i felt then i kind of could drop that and then i i could enter a totally different level i was kind of lying there and yeah continuously moving and it was a completely different way of what's going feeling what's going on and then i could really enjoy it in a completely non-definable way in some sense it was very interesting i found myself asking what is the thing it's really like a basic philosophical question this whole ontology and it's the thing now what's on the screen is the thing in your bodies is it what's in between it also relates to the question of image and what is it beyond that i'm trying to figure out what you're doing on how you're doing it and then there's a whole question of archiving and documenting that i feel like um something that we've been dealing for long term with iod that on one end of the spectrum there's trying to capture real sense as a sense of something and make it stay to put it on my end on the other end is using documents creatively but then it becomes a new thing and not necessarily an archive of what was there so the and of course there's many options in between so these were the questions i found myself and then also i also found myself nesting in the in between but i also found myself asking beyond effect what is the end of it that's the question i think so okay the end of it i i know that is the promise of something i believe there is a promise of something yet to come as i said like it's it's in the practice that i know something will happen i don't i try to not know what is going to happen so it's something that it lingers that is between so it's not dance and it's not video but it's in between both and it has to be in our research we try to make it functional so because in technology you work with the electricity and that's one series always coding is very effective so we try to not make functional but we do but it's difficult because you you entering you know as a dancer uh i think the best the beautiful part of dancing is when you start let's say because then you know uh it happens to me personally my career at some point when i was working professionally then and then i started losing the interest because i it was just in a way you know or you judge too much let's say the joy of just this first part is lost and i relate that uh with a kind of like a state of like trust trusting they know and try to aiming to be in the space and just embody it experience without knowing what is going i just know there is a promise of something yet to come i believe i try to believe there is something coming with this every time that i go there uh i have a question for you because you said that it was the first time you had witnesses and i'm wondering what kind of an effect it had on you because then it's it's not a research it's a performance is it a performance what does it mean to have the live witness while the video witnessed because my question is also was it for you and you know the first time meeting in this place like this yeah because you were in colombia so it was for you to also the first time being in in the space uh three months after we met but then we were aiming to do something uh special i mean we were trying to do something good it was three months after we met and we were like really okay basically like okay this is gonna work and it just we failed somehow it didn't work because we tried to use our beers the art space it's just really complex the chroma key a lot of things with technology didn't work so we failed but after 10 minutes of like feeling like this was horrible and it wasn't a big festival uh they were trying to put this there like let's say that's a multimedia festival and dance is new there so in a way like this here is like new technology but in the media festival that was that was new and then uh that was for us super shock now we were in a shared online space where people can join online to see our performance at that time i kind of ranked it as performance and i think at first four people came from 83 and everything was not working and like literally like everyone left after like 10 minutes and that was the time it really like really liberated myself and now i'm like i just take time and do whatever and i can yeah like no one's watching so today unfortunately you are here but um it was i think it went fine no no thank you for coming can i repeat my question now what went fine because i'm curious what how you're experiencing it uh for me let's say what i found difficult is that i mean for me i stopped dancing in 2017 because i couldn't handle the pressure of being on stage and these kind of things so i started working with computers and at some point i met this guy and i i started dancing again the last 2020. that's the short like beautiful story for me i start dancing i have some traumas with my own dance and in 2017 i stopped i didn't want to do it and then now i dance again and promise like an addiction to go every week and just go there and move i don't care i don't have the pressure of nothing for me it's just fine so whatever i can say that this because i'm trying to get out with my own trauma my own heart here this thing that is here right now when i go in the practice i'm out of this and really release a lot of my attention so it's an addiction for me to go every week so i can say in my experience today to get out of myself was not too easy but very difficult that's what i can say here yeah yeah because yeah i don't know i'm a dancer yeah it's just something with myself thank you so much for the offering i really appreciate that you were willing to liberate yourselves here you know with this practice being live and you've never done that before thanks for letting us be your witnesses i always appreciate seeing something like this you know when it's just that it's sort of new infancy stages of discovery and i was curious to ask about the fact that you're working in these frames so on computers you're working in squares trying you know like rectangles but i see these organic shapes coming up in the imaging that you're choosing to capture i'm not sure if these are the correct words to use with the process but um how are you choosing what to capture what to repeat like is there some type of practice going on there is that all you mean like the technology like technology yeah like when you're choosing an image to capture and then have it repeat or when you're creating a new line of code what is going through your like what is the process for you i think we have a completely different flow like nothing myself the way how we do the way i do is i put some motion somehow so or i try to define i move or the image move kind of a bit at the beginning and then from there i will start we have this software that allows stage design oh you can talk we have i think we have we use a lot of these hashtags because we come every week also to talk we have a lot of con there are more than 200 hours now on youtube of what is what we do we talk a lot and there's a lot of hashtags that we use through the magazine you go through the hashtags one of these things that we said is a stage design you know like basically how you stage is the stage like the best of the sign in a way you said like so i don't know how to answer that no the reason why i said stage design is because how we choose image like windows like different images sometimes it's like a grid that's like a whole stage design for us like the whole desktop like on the computer is what actually is like part of the state i mean that is the stage itself and it is like architecture and that's where um also it is a practice to do the stage design basically i think actually i wanted to refer to something like also that you're writing and i'm just saying some words now and also in terms of um i feel like there is an amplification of disinterest and disengagement in the practice which i find especially interesting in in an attention relationship to how you actually restlessly move around the technology in order to change your environment and surprise you in the same time very subtle narratives and stories can sneak in but in a very flat way and i found it very interesting in terms of how to actually create narratives and and give stage how you create the stage like it can sneak around you know and you can see the stories inside and how there is a lot of intensity but how so flat how you create environment for it and now of course with us being there so because even if you do it without us there is audience and with us there is no audience so in this kind of tension um i found very uh beautiful uh what can happen within that and also i could see some so for me there are offices associations like to electronic disturbance theater even television kind of like i don't know i don't say it as a projection now on it but also how you inscribe yourself into your practice in a very daily level in terms of yeah queer a queer way of storytelling which is quite interesting because you create characters in it that meet daily or in a certain period of time so you overscribe also i find it very interesting i don't know how to find words for it but i think this i mean the way because you describe it and i completely understand what you're saying but in the way how i see it it's like i consciously try to not uh to get away from representation my research one of the questions is that is i talk about uh posthuman uh um yeah how to make it short uh oh just kidding myself um yeah in the practice i realized my aim is trying to get out of here because of how i hate him and i love him so that's what i deal with every day so um is but i cannot avoid my my identities they come but then what i try to do is because i'm insisting it's just i try to hack the moment and then i will agree with you and then i just let it pass through and sometimes the hurricane needs to say something so something that let me do my thing so uh this is a negotiation and that but as much as possible i try to get away from representation but on the other hand um you said posthuman and i know that some people has hesitation for this work but the reason why we refer to this is because um for us we kind of become pixels in a way that uh because we do it uh often i mean almost always online so we both how we are represented on each other's computers just pixels and sound waves and this is very interesting because it it's not just like adding this character but also now we're kind of equal like we don't have hierarchy between ourselves and also like windows and cursors and all these elements on the desktop so in a way it kind of makes the like breaks the priority between the human and technology and this is possible because we work with images but it's still like really alive we're not like dead on the videos but we're alive and we're still like interacting with maybe if i can add something on that is like in our research like we found it what we present is something that we call this a new audiovisual body because it's not my body it's not a video but it's not it's a body it's an artificial body it's a pixel body um i wonder too with the experience of people looking at this what you just did on zoom was even with ours because there's you know level visceral understanding of what's going on we're not just seeing the squares right we're not just seeing the screen we're seeing your bodies doing the work yeah that was the most intriguing part to me there was such a performance going on in the room you know in a lot of ways so just to throw that out there for you as you're doing your research it's a very intriguing thing to watch it's not the way so but there were people that where is our way home and we know we would like to hear you guys is it possible to hear you we're having a pretty nice conversation i just i just wanted to say i mean i thought it was beautiful i thought it was great and i'm i'm really curious because our perception of it because we we're filled with it we've got the full screen we've got the intimacy that's a different kind of um caliber or a different kind of space can you hear me yes yes you are here yeah i mean i intentionally kept the screen to my upper right so i could see you live in a very minuscule in a very minimum sense because i wanted to that was my agency that was my desire to see what was happening in the live moment yeah i'm curious i wrote something down um about um and i thought it was really beautiful that you were saying about what i call dissolving the indexable that you're that you're in a constant desire to um to dissolve the index meaning um the identity of whatever that image is or whatever that image relates to that doesn't mean that somebody witnessing or an audience will see something and they carry it away but for you for you in negotiation together but i'm curious about your organization of your archive because your archive is huge i can tell um and i know i've worked with this guy carlos um and he has a humongous archive of video of sound of stuff and when he does live performances of the the choice making that goes in i think there's some pre-choice making that happens that may slip into the choreographic but then there's other things that happen in the moment that he has a realization of what he's got and uses it in that moment so i'm curious about that for you i think the way i mean it's just because we start doing that and we didn't know what i mean just we started meeting with this guy and then at some point it was it started like now to propose some meetups through a group choreographic lab and then somehow i was the one who was always there and then in time that they became this thing that we always practice in contemporary dance just without which is going to create a massive online archive we thought it was uh we wanted to store material because we couldn't find so much about it so we thought it was important to incentivize the conversation with we are not trying to say this is good or bad but it's more interested in just put content out for people to to actually define what is it and the other thing that in time that it was more advanced in time that we said was uh there is a concept that we use that we said there is like an active archive uh hashtag active archive and is the act of sometimes in the practice we try to activate the archive because we do things in real time so in a way we do post editing in real time uh in a way so we use sometimes materials from the archives that's actually we try to do many times but because we get too excited we don't do it but we try we say many times like we should use our guides like because as part of the things that are in paper in a way try to activate the archive but we did it today no it's not true we did it because we put lisa lisa who was what the one of the presenters before we have a chat with her and that was their kite and she was on the performance today yes the practice today lisa also an interesting thing i find is your languaging is that or are you consciously aware or interested in that you're using the functionality of the code you know but at times when you're trying to figure it out and you're speaking it as you're doing it and i find that really really interesting that that becomes part of the palette of the performative and just any any things that you'd like to say about that uh we have a lot of to be honest today was super easy in that sense like we have a lot of frustration but we get used to the frustration because say like my understanding of code of this this this code is way less than auto so then i get oh that's why he was asking sometimes are you okay because sometimes i get locked and like okay which function should i use um uh but to be honest we have like pro in some practices we are just i'm cursing in spanish and all the time and yeah and so yeah it's a very frustrating thing but then we try to bypass what can i do with the frustration if i stay in portugal i stay frustrated but if i try to put it in a performative state in a way then i can do something with the frustration that's great it's great use it use it the obstacle is is fantastic yeah and i think i think too it brings us more into the the realness or the vitality of um the elements of the materials because i believe you know i believe they're all materials everything from the keyboard to what's happening in the line to what's happening in the visual and to the overlapping to the words to the hashtags to the they're all there they're i mean they're all they're all material absolutely yeah thanks for the comments yeah especially i want to like uh like have to say the last word about the words frustration that sometimes we make it playful like we transform into a hashtag so it's like nothing so serious but it's something you can laugh about and also we've played with languages because we have different routes uh i'm from japan or is from colombia and we speak different languages so that's kind of where we play and we think about decoration of technology poly everything which is a huge topic so i will close here before but you can still talk onto i think please have a nice conversation i would i would like to i would like to acknowledge the marathon the bubble is doing because i don't this you have been online for so long that i'm just wondering how is it for you you've been online for so long how is it going for you um pretty uh i mean you know isn't this the standard of this here at least for me this is the this is what i'm used to now okay this is my chair and i can rock and these are my gadgets that i can use to navigate my experiences it's quite lovely to be moving between uh a sense that is so extremely local in this room right and then unlike last year where i felt like i was vibing with all the other locales this here there's this there is this so like looking into a world of this room that you are in um which i think adds at least for me um either like a fantastic perspective or a sci-fi perspective there's there's there's a there's a sense of unrealness to it which i think becomes poetic relative to all the things that we were discussing all the topics and and the experiences that are being brought up um so that's pretty uh i don't know sense inducing i think it's amazing how we like we get into this matrix we get used to this uh i think we have to close yeah uh i was uh thank you guys uh thank you pablo i will see you i will make thank you so much jorge and yotos awesome thank you for the stimulating conversation everybody we're going to take a break for 30 minutes and maria and susan are going to set up their their set up", "mtl9W-YhLLc": "all right so hello we're back in arsenal arsenal yes oops today my my windshield is gone no um i hope this windshield actually works hello we're already recording yeah hello hello i think you can introduce yourself but beyond the formal introduction i don't read like your biography born in anyways wait what do i say like your name whatever you want you don't have to be formal okay that's the spirit of this okay yeah so hi hi hello um yes you actually pronounced like lisa like okay yeah it's the l is not dark l it's dark l it's not dark so it's not dark it's light l and the dark is at the front of the palette blue yes and the light is in the back of the palette so this is the lisa yeah so it's very different from lisa wow it's already already something but you were saying something very interesting the last thing you said was that what was this this is like alzheimer's is the language of improvisation yeah and i mean somehow the the relationship is what we do that um is an error it's some kind of error in a system in the computer at least what it means is there's an error that it corrects itself you see when you when the image is passing at some point you see but it comes back to normal that's what you call a glitch it's literally a bot in the system that it just becomes just it corrects itself um and then i somehow it makes me think of when you said like the alzheimer is the language of the conversation uh because you were sharing a personal story but in the way who i make the analogy is is like that do you see some relation into the to how you see this is some relation between like the way how you see alzheimer's as a language of improvisation and glitch [Music] i i got really excited at some point when you spoke about glitch because what i've realized is that we're glitching from where to where we're glitching from where to where not from a to b but from where to where yeah that's really cool where to wear where to where yeah go on yes please um what did you understand the thing is like how i see normal when i see communication like straightforward is you need an emitter and a recipient and it's always a message that goes from point a to b so that's straightforward but what i found interesting is you say like it goes from where to where that's that's more rich i think it it has a another dimension to it absolutely right because okay um and well i'm thinking about i'm thinking if i want to be concrete or very abstract concrete for me is more emotional because it has to do with personal experience with my embodied experience okay this is concreteness for me it will always touch something okay but not the mindfulness that we know the practice of mindfulness but rather being literally full of mind so like aware like very like the scope would you say would you agree and saying that the scope will be bigger i mean or there will be more focus when you try to be more uh concrete and would be more uh the scope will be bigger when you try to make it abstract an expert in language but also micro and macro vision is something that in different discourses would mean something different right so i know what what i know what i mean when i say microvision and microvision but um macro vision but but then someone else who's coming from economics they will hear me use this this language and they will they were like wait what are you doing like you're misusing you're misusing words and i am i am using them in other directions so i'm misusing the the the purpose maybe that the purpose for which it was created somehow you're hacking the purpose like they go back to this idea you're hacking the language itself yeah and i think and and but then again we are all hacking the language i'm not i'm not alone in this act of happy i am now aware of it because because we're talking about it but that then is when it comes in play what i was saying but you said like did you speak about this thing what i learned from this or what i think about that is more a culture than a knowledge you know it's more something that rather you cultivate and you try to make it in your life through awareness then learning you know it's not knowledge-based it's just it's then when speaking about culture you are interestingly for me mention the word cultivate repeat the last sentence you said it's not it's not a practice right was that the word used like hacking is not a practice it's not something you do it's something no actually it's not something that you learn somehow it's that's something you can teach somehow but i see that it's more like a something more a culture something that's more cultural or that's the way i perceive it more something to know that you will find in books uh i think something just you cultivate okay okay what is cultivating oh wait so you said hacking yeah but what is it like like what hacking are we talking about i think that what i'm talking about here hacking is the way ho basically so uh i think maybe we can make the differentiation between them again like uh like hacking and then cracking you put it like straightforward and technology but what one person one myself i thought about hacking when i started studying computers like four years ago was about this idea of the hacker who is breaking to the into the bank and breaking passwords because he's just malicious or doing something uh but then you have so the cracker it will is the person who is breaking into the system with malicious purposes but then the hacker will be the one who is more finding failures in the system you know in order to build things so you know in order to actually so he's not breaking things but he's rather building things that's the way how i see the hacker is the hacker is some somebody who is seeing how the system works maybe some failures on spaces where the hacker can go into the system to create agency for other things to happen that's that's what i'm speaking but i speak when we're trying to speak about this hacking issues mediation so it's a relatively new profession i think from what i remember but it makes sense to me because it's it's it's a hack uh it's hacking into the judicial system and rather than uh for instance not a lawyer but the judge is something in between he's something not even in between he's not on that scale because is to actually prevent the arrival it doesn't go on on your right you're wrong you you were the bad guy here and you are so holy [Laughter] yeah i remember this friends in japan they kind of initiative like basically like they rent spaces that are kind of like not usually like rented or like housing like maybe some like diy renovations needed or you know like it's not like a normal flap that you can just like rent so these people like try to use make use of this space like for cultural or art uh use and this was a lawyer but he was basically you know advising the artists how to make things happen because there's like always like borderline like for example in japan like if you do a kind of party with like selling tickets then you need like a approval from the city or something like that but then with this space i think they i had a lot so the lawyer was saying that if you do it like for friends and not like not with official ticket sales then you can do it without approval oh yeah yeah how how does he check the that the level of closeness between people friends or yeah so that's kind of the great the great thing yeah exactly but i feel like your friend are you a friend or everyone's friend right but that's like a nice uh example i thought about it and also like that it's exactly like what i um associate with hacking hacking the system basically yeah yeah i think you know in a way the way i see it is one thing we can agree or i i i dare to say that we agree is that basically is it's the willingness to try to uh generate agency basically uh for other things to happen uh like no in a person not in a personal level because actually when we're speaking here often we are speaking about groups so it's yeah i think i think that maybe that could be at the core also hacking is like when you're trying to uh use this or break into the system uh maybe not break but like try to see where you can go in the system to generate something new is because you actually you have the idea that other ones maybe can do something from it uh which is agent agency is put in challenge the agency what is the agency for you [Music] agency for me wow i'll make some sounds [Laughter] we always talk about agency but what is agency what is like because agencies like you know we see it in like real life it's not just like article text but i think travel agencies also agency that's something but i think at the core i think like i would put it more in the aloe vera i think there is potentiality and potentiality in is agency in itself that's the way who i see it more potentiality what is potentiality potentiality is it's agency in itself it's just the possibility of something to come sometimes possibility of something to come something to happen yeah perfect in that case agency for me is everything and this is ridiculous to say that but i agree in a way this is ridiculous because if you assign if you if you assign a word with all the possible meanings in the world then it loses its meaning it is yeah but that's what you go like like you are really into like uh what we were talking then i think because of your practice then you know the vida the like and the idea of like the construction right it's the first person to start like proposing the construction and when you speak you you make this macro macro micro like very fast and and i absolutely i can get from where it comes is from um so yes but i said yes but at the same time i think when we talk about uh i think the difference in this case what i was trying to say is that i think it's just then the awareness of when to zone things because one can say like so if agencies everything in a way then you still need to have cluster to make some things to show up at points in order to define in order to because you could be the same example you have the main awareness but you need to have micro awareness in different moments i'm not sure awareness is involved or maybe i'm not getting what awareness is yeah so what you said like every everything is agency i i really like it because like how i see it is basically like if you start to see this not as a table but you know a camera mount then i can use as a camera mount and you know like i i really like to like play with the chair because like not like really i don't want to fall before the symposium but like i sometimes play with it because then it becomes something more mobile um i don't know that's something i associate a lot i mean about but from what i get from what you said like is it is that something like on that line or is it something else so who is the agent in this case for you that's also a question because what i am suggesting in this case specifically is that perhaps we don't need awareness to be an agent the table is an agent yep the chair is an agent it doesn't have maybe it does have awareness i don't know i i was never a table before yeah or a chair but this is also like this question like it was a joke but also that kind of creates like a different perspective because maybe i was actually a table and that for me really like relaxes and makes like different perspectives and then we're going into embodiment that's also true yeah but then how you make the leap between the ah because you relaxes you relax already you assume that the table is no the representation of a table for you is it's a place to relax on at this given moment which allows you to become relaxed as soon as you imagine that you are a table yes is this how it works no like uh relax like how it works i don't know how it works i don't know but this is like already like a really interesting conversation because now things are like kind of less defined yeah right because we're not talking about you know table should be this or our perspective should be this but then like i maybe i don't get what you mean or you don't get what i mean but that's where you know we're still having a conversation exactly yeah and also what i think is cool also in this is that if you go back to the conversation that we have before it's like this like this is awesome when you have when you have like an eurocentric thought in philosophy is always not only philosophy that i think in life normally is based on dialectics which basically is always is like in search of the truth so when you go to high-end places where people are i don't know our phds in philosophy or people who let's say know a lot of western uh culture they always will try to have the last word you know i need to convince you with arguments with rational arguments that i'm right and that you are wrong and that's gone and on and on and on and on and on like with the day club debate club i like that right isn't it all about all right no no i'm right i have more i'm more convincing right yes yes yes yes and this is this is judicial system as well okay someone is right yeah okay yeah i see your connection so mediation comes and says no no guys nobody's right or wrong we just want us to feel happy and be able to have a conversation right it's a heavy [Laughter] relax here relax relax and we wear suits and everything but that's just we're all tables for a moment they started meeting let's all be a table for right now everybody hold her everybody came in their ties like with their [Laughter] this is how mediation is done wow wow like this feeling that i i totally get it and i totally don't get it like this this weird feeling you know exactly because we are tend to be uh we we are used we as humans right as [Applause] as the culture that i come from or the culture that i i think anyway you take the way to to where you need but but i think that we are taught to think in in a very linear way yeah and when we are taught that way we we can't see the value of something that is outside this linearity and we are invited to focus all the time on something very specific but what if my focus right now is going to that person walking there what if i don't feel like looking into your eyes like i should in a cultural uh in a in a friendly conversation my focus is there but my and i'm also listening to the music and and i like this song what if i'm there for a moment and not listening to what you're saying right no you should listen there was something on alzheimer but i think for me that's like really makes me yeah interested about neurodiversity for example like you have adhd you know like the attention is everywhere if you're autistic uh whatever i don't know how to explain it um if you're ocd you can just not let things go mentally this this really like creates the like glitch or error in the you know communication or basically everything and that makes adds the you know richness to the but that's what i think i was trying to say that in both cases then i think what is interesting from the glitch that you have the glitch is there is an error they didn't fix it somehow itself so it's something that actually just there to refresh something it just refreshes uh the linearity nice it comes there to break the lead the linearity refreshes but then it keeps on some going somewhere maybe maybe there was no linearity to start with perhaps i was thinking and then in that case alzheimer's it's the correction is the correction to the glitch to the glitch to the glitch of linearity yeah it makes me think like i know somebody who got some accident in her like oh when you have like they have an accident and they have a yeah they overnight an accident in the brain and then when she was back then it took a while until she's recovering but so let's say her consciousness is back but then uh speaking wise or something that she's struggled with things because she has the accident when you have like beings in the brain that explode you know this name for that so it takes her but it was not strong because from the outside it was it was she have a hair concussion concussion yeah i think it's concussion it's more like a brain damage i don't know how it's there it's one of the brains in the brain that they they explode basically and then you have some bleeding in the brain and you can basically go or you can die from that or if you are you're alive basically you have 50 50 chances to stay in coma or not because you cannot recover or you go to the other part which is really uncertain because it's like you will recover so let's say your consciousness is back somehow but then it takes time until you understand all these things because you like 35 years of your life in a way of how you two like all the nuances the differences between how i should understand social cues all these things are gone i should understand how to hold this well all the little things like uh so then something that the person needs to build is slowly slowly and it needs to somehow i mean he has to deal a lot in the beginning because i saw it with frustration because the person understands this is me but my body is not yet there and it feels it feels like that it cannot express itself you know so it's like super freaking out inside which can somehow make me think a bit of alzheimer's i don't have experience with alzheimer's but it makes me feel in this in in the case that i'm explaining that the person i know the person because many times she was crying so just because she's just i'm nervous i'm okay with just like i'm here but i cannot express why somebody has to help me to the toilet i mean all these kind of things because life is new and then it slowly becomes like this becomes it just recovers in their own time that in the place where she is now for instance how i see that she interact with the people now that is like one year almost one year after is that i pay way more attention now because i found she's dutch she's a part of the family of my girlfriend they're very close to flemish people from the countryside and before in a way i thought was now i found this more interesting in a way because in a way it's more rich also for me she doesn't have so many filters you know so because she don't know yet she's learning the filters just now and i think it's very interesting aren't the filters the glitch the social conventions i don't i i would say they're more like filters i think i would say it actually is more like layers like the way i will see it is the social conventions are more like layers that as you get older and older and older you put more and more and more and more from like when you're a baby yeah and then you start putting more layers you start learning more things that you're supposed to do because somebody filters serve what purpose what greater purpose i think like in short the way i see it like to not kill each other basically that's in short like the way because at the end how i see it like that's my microvision of the wearing away like we are freaking animals we are just monkeys somehow but in somehow we managed not to kill each other and we are in a rock that is turning super fast going into the infinitude and infinity is flagged and so so many ways what it's like it's like a joke what we're living like we are able to kill each other at any moment right that we don't do it because we have the future define it for we have to we hacked reality i mean i don't know the whole story with the cosmos is like it's absurd like you know this is going super fast right now somewhere in the space the planet you know it's the end entropy is going into the infinity this is a rock that is going into the infinity tube of space right now you want to say hello come here it's going to be uploaded online yeah class will be one of our guests in the coming sessions we are here in vienna i just woke up sorry good morning arsenal i had a conversation with my dad today i told him so i'm teaching tomorrow at the arsenal and he's like i was like yeah this is this place where world war ii was planned it's like i don't know what they don't but arsenal is a place where you keep stuff it's right it's a warehouse yeah and i was like actually no one told me that i just assumed this is what it is because i don't know the word and somehow arsenal connects to me in my mind yeah for me too like the first time i heard it also i just thought like where are the weapons but have you seen the museum no you have to tell her yeah so this morning um i met a professor from our school which is a bit weird because she's teaching in colombia she's based in vienna and we went to the museum basically uh we saw the collection from world war one and world war ii so that's you know something really coming back but i found it's quite interesting like the okay so let's not talk about world war ii because that's just like just heavy thing you know like weapons and propaganda and things like that it's just toxic but world war like they started with like really like their costumes like so many like you know like fur and those like accessories they really try to make it like you know i am the i'm so cool yeah i'm so cool it's so cool to be fighting is like wow you should wear our uniform yeah and if you compare to world war two it's just like portraits of you know uh politicians that's just like just you know like sitting in front of the desk they're just like so it's just sad there's a horse of course so this is where is that what is that exactly airplane why didn't you sign up for i hang here to ride a horse or wear like fancy feather and now desk work like a bureaucrat just signing papers what is this is war crazy but they get so efficient by having people sitting or they get so successful by showing people like politicians yeah basically they have how they say it yeah they have to lead not with the power but by the speech or by the gesture right so it's i don't know what to do they shifted their commercial [Music] that they they shifted the way they advertise themselves yeah basically yeah and there's also like propaganda like posters they only like happened like maybe towards the end of world war one but in the collection like mostly from world war ii and who who who was the hacker of the propaganda was it the hacker or uh i see a lot of cracker a hacker yeah well i would say cracker because they're evil but but it's it's really like you know they try to put like simple message right we're talking about propaganda now propaganda and the question and the question and the question is are there were are the propagators hackers or crackers the people who prop uh the people who made the propaganda are they hackers and trackers wait i think it's always with the bands from i think they just provide a service no for who's the but the audience who is the customer the customer is the same if you put it like in uh nazism will be the theater uh so it will just they provide a service as a designer or whatever for the general to transmit a message uh i think they provide just a service but no one paid them i'm sure that you'll get paid wait is there job is it i always thought that propaganda is grassroots no propaganda is from the government why do they think that it's grassroots that's more they probably don't see the purple and this one but it's like grassroots is coming from the community from or maybe i'm thinking about um oh the other way around yeah yeah that's because that's more like protest process yeah and at some point can become a manifesto like a manifest is more like a person demanding a manifesto is a call to action against what is happening most likely yeah not only necessary but i would say yeah because basically somebody speaking with a loud voice from something that is happening and the person is not agreeing with the system at the point so it's calling to action to people unite for something manifest what is the difference between or what is the relationship between hacker and art and activists that's interesting because you have hacktivism maybe now auto can you speak a bit of this well i don't know about that but i like hacktivism and there is something specific only about activism don't know but there are separate things right because activism can be doesn't have to be hacking you just you know stand up and protest for example and that's not efficient or if it's efficient that's activism that activism is somehow associated with against something but rather not in yeah because i think it's something that you think something is wrong yeah so you have to go against the current regime or whatever i think yeah would be i think you cannot imagine uh i mean whether we think language now like it's difficult for me to imagine an activism that is supporting the government you know it's difficult to imagine language it's possible but in that case you will hack the system i think like knowing the language i think is more seen as the activism somehow is it has to say something that is not agreeing with that in the system that is happening like act it seems to be something in the present you know like something that we want now okay there is also a noun for that act in a plague right what what how do they relate how do they relate i think like the act is i would say it as a verb you know i mean it can be both but sorry what are we talking about now activism yeah i can say what i'm uh trying to understand and i'm kind of asking you to help me um let's help each other yeah i'm trying to understand how come we came to associate activism with protests because there are all kinds of activisms i'm thinking about for instance people who speak for people with a particular illness asking with the purpose of changing the um the policies the governmental policies to do with this illness or to do with this condition to help people to make them more feasible accessibility activism right think about that um activists for um people struggling with mental health it's people who is calling to action oh it's people who demand some some change or they so it's a matter of what is change because what has changed for you [Music] this swift uh between states so change basically i think can't go in a physical like the water change the eyes change into water uh so the something that it changed the core is the same yeah but it just the the form changes i think activism and protest is is more like activism is the act or the not act how to say it's more about the idea right and protest is the action that they often do so it's not like something that it's not synonymous right but uh it's just a means of activism can be processed this is one of the forms that activism takes on yeah right by the way there's also articles oh yeah i don't exactly know like i hear it like you know once in a while but isn't like something that's like a definition to it or just like people use it when there's cross-section of art and action it brings me back to the same idea we talked about before with me coming to people from one discipline and speaking and saying particular words that mean to me something one thing because i'm coming from a different discipline and then once we start speaking it clashes we don't understand each other we judge we say he we talked about that as well like this identity issue how do i present myself to myself in a particular circle how to present myself to others in a given circle to avoid judgment personal me judging myself i'm not a good enough dancer i'm not a good enough teacher if i'm in the teachers convention right i will switch if you say you're a dancer yeah yeah for example right if i say i'm a dancer at the teacher's convention i'm good if i say that i'm a teacher at the dancers convention i'm still good right i'm not don't like don't judge me who am i speaking to to myself me personally and yeah and then projecting to others of course um but if i take responsibility over this this this ability this ability to [Music] to give the attention needed to every word i use and every word that another person uses where a conflict arises this is where we start we start hacking this is where this mediation process becomes um a way of life so you mean active yeah so i mean art artism is kind of the way to bypass this judgment judgmental process for example yeah you're playing right an art is to play it's an art dance like anything in in in hebrew it it works very interestingly it's it's a language to do with roots all the words each word has a root and and everything is interlinked like all the words are somehow interlinked and so there is the word emit which is truth there is the word which is faith and there is the word which is art and they're all connected and it sounds to me they are maybe to someone else they don't because someone come can come and say this is not from the same rule or start explaining to me the ethology of the words and and why they are not connected but for me in my in my experience of of life they are interlinked to me when i do art i speak truth your truth yes of course is this important to say who's who's truth and this is that to me this is the ridiculous thing when we go to new the news this channel is speaking the truth this one is not but there are so many truth in this world right how can i speak about what like how can you i'm telling you the truth of course sure first yeah i think i think it's a good closing for the for the chat yeah i was thinking with this topic and then you know something we have to we can you know we think about all right so thanks for joining us in the chat thank you and we can follow your workshop or talk presentation tomorrow yes at 2 to 3 30. great p.m so please check out i don't be i don't think i'm gonna upload this on time but check the website it will be there yes yes thank you for watching uh please like the video and thank you lisa for being with us today and talking about your art practice it was a pleasure thank you so much and thanks for watching", "IQ9JTec5zfI": "the frame yes okay should i also do the sound recording with the other one no the way the sun was okay just with that one the last time in the point they practiced i'll try no oh thank you i was playing with it while practicing this is this right so we are back to the chat this is the chat yes so we are at the arsenal now we are at arsenal yes we have so without like a general rehearsal [Laughter] kind of oh my god it's hot it's hot the computer was like blowing yeah so like at first i thought okay my computer is like you know crap but then like my computer was blowing out i have a new computer kind of like basically for me like i couldn't open obs and chrome at the same time like this is just like a joke yeah right yeah yeah yeah yeah but anyway so from at home we should do it like to see yeah that shouldn't be okay because i did it at home and i didn't have the problem because i understand to have the the wi-fi connection problem but just the any application my computer was like the mouse was like everything was black oh yeah well now it's the sun is you know low so so much better but yeah um so i wanted to ask like i want to talk about this like do we actually need live lab if we are in the same space i need live lab i i need live lab okay yeah because today i was playing with live love because in live love is the easiest way how i can feedback my name my own image but it's like for the like feedback for your feedback yeah for people with myself okay because i think but also because also yes yes say what you were saying yeah it's just like uh with my setup it doesn't really handle like if i want to do like live lab and hydra and there's no feedback all the things with obs i think it's not going to work [Music] but then at the same time like because we're in the same space it doesn't have to be you know because for the regular practice it's really important because i mean that's how we connect but if you're in the same space actually doesn't really matter so much i mean because also like i can you know direct the camera so you just appear in my screen i think what i will feel more comfortable so is like then we basically we use one computer i mean uh that was what i was trying to invite you sorry sorry uh to then somehow we kind of play a bit between so that we have to actually jump in the tool of the other one which we normally don't do so like for instance you come you see what you're doing but then now you know the i will come and then i do something different uh and then just we deal with yeah i mean that's how like at the end of the note we did it yeah yeah yeah but so now i think what we can do until we do this share with them is then we just we have to get used to that space where how can i use your tools you're going to use mark tools also because for instance like the way how i approach the hydra my the functions that i use are like maybe are four so like it's different for me it's easy for reason but you do something then i start corrupting based on what you do you see what i mean because for me i cannot start because i don't know them that's why i said like put something there and then from there i can start moving these things proceed uh and then we use your um i don't know what you're doing with yours but we can use that i mean as something similar to what you were doing today yeah i was just using obs like obs color key obs color filter and stuff like that because what i liked it was i think we could in my opinion what i felt it was maybe we can play more is with and then i would like to do it also is then to use the text and the text and show it there yeah that was cool yeah that was cool yeah and also like i tried not to make it nice like it's just like work pad because why not um but this is like the stage design we always do right like with the desktop like how we play with the desktop and stuff and i think it's like important for me to yeah do it with the wordpad and it kind of worked and well i think it worked and just we have to do it then you give it to me i mean just we have to do what we think about what we do today was good technology wise given the conditions you know what's good because basically at some point we just do something from what we have we're getting you getting better at this and this like whatever okay now is this what can i do with this yeah um and then but then it's more the practice of feel comfortable that i can take your tool and feel comfortable that you can take my my tool you know that we can because that's somehow something that we haven't we don't have the practice and that's kind of like a private space you know what i mean yeah we don't have that practice yet right well i guess we'll see we just have to see i think and something that i wanted to say for me was it's difficult like in the space that we were doing as if it's very difficult for me to try to do the exercise of like the self self dissociation try to just stop being trying to start not being jorge because the people is around and then i start thinking i should dance good or you know and then i will start judging a lot that's yeah that's really true you know this kind of space we're in because you know you're very well vulnerable yeah yeah so definitely the exercise of being self dissociate is not so easy to to get into because in in our own studios i'm protected from the corruption of the image and the glitch but i guess it's different when we present it with the people because they expect that we present something something like that yeah so it will be like a stage which is not a stage but it's a stage so which you know it might be awkward or uncomfortable i don't know but we'll see it's gonna be fine really i don't know it will it will be fine even if it's not fine like when we got lost today like the end we took the best road going up i'm like the last the last curve when the instead of taking the the bad road oh yeah we took the nice road and just by yeah it's kind of coming to arsenal yeah yeah yeah by chance and it's always that so and this just happens this weekend and we're not gonna do it every week so that's gonna be something you'll witness something yeah yeah and also like for online people i think we just don't care we i don't even think about streaming because that might you can try we can keep it anyway like we put one stream in the website because people are already so the website stays there and then just we put uh what's that today yeah i don't know like i thought so many things to talk about but i think it's it was quite easy i mean we have to try it uh yeah tomorrow we do it do it again yeah yeah come here sometime same time same place same place i'd like to see this studio too but i think there should be people there because that's the only thing it's quite busy place yeah you know what would be nice go and jump in the water we should do that i would i would love to jump to the water which water the the new uh sit down yeah so we still switch far though i don't know i'm kind of low in energy right now i mean yes and no yeah to be honest if it's if it's there i would love to do it it's a bit far it makes it far far you know what like we're like biking like 60 more than 60 kilometers already this week i can check the exact number it's 67 kilometers so 20 minutes by bike getting there yeah that's about i mean i would love to have ice cream the good one ah yeah good vegan ice cream because it might be a little bit cold i don't know maybe not you know maybe it's the only thing i feel uncomfortable is like the laptop maybe i'll just pass by home and maybe i just go to the water yeah that's true sure it would be nice to have like a practice in water i just like randomly thought how it's gonna be you have to dive to like type and then you come back and then you have to dive again compute laptop is on the ground ah okay no it's i'm just thinking about the dance walk guy because he had this in a water session but i think maybe we can close here it will be uploaded so so please like it like the video thank you for the four people like the video last video laura and someone and my mom the cat my cat and uh yeah we'll probably upload another one tomorrow or something we do the practice now so check them out tomorrow bye bye", "0uip4OabhIc": "right so we are back to the chat this is the chat yes in the chat so we are at the arsenal now we are at arsenal yes we have without like a general rehearsal kind of oh my god it's hot it's hard the computer was like blowing yeah so like at first i thought okay my computer is like you know crap but then like my computer was blowing also i have a new computer kind of like basically for me like i couldn't open obs and chrome at the same time [Music] and i didn't have the problem yeah because i understand to have the the wi-fi connection problem but just the any application my computer was like the mouse was like everything was lagged yeah well now it's the sun is you know low so it's so much better but yeah um so i wanted to ask like i want to talk about this like do we actually need live lab if we are in the same space i need live life i i need live love okay yeah because today i was playing with live love because in live love is the easiest way i can feedback my day my own image but it like took for it for the like feedback for your feedback yeah for people with myself because i think but also because also yesterday do you say what you were saying yeah it's just like uh with my setup it doesn't really handle like if i want to do like live lab and hydra and digital feedback all the things with obs i think it's not gonna work it's gonna work but then at the same time like because we're in the same space it doesn't have to be you know because for the regular practice it's really important because i mean that's how we connect but if you're in the same space actually it doesn't really matter so much i mean

yeah yeah but so now i think what we can do until we do this share with them is then we just we have to get used to that space where how can i use your tools you're going to use smart tools also because for instance like the way i approach the hydra my the functions that i use are like maybe are four so like it's different for me it's easy for reason but you do something then i start corrupting based on what you do you see what i mean because for me i cannot start because i don't know them that's why i said like put something there and then from there i can start moving these

uncomfortable is like the laptop maybe i'll just pass by home and maybe i just go to water yeah that's true it would be nice to have like a practice in water i just like randomly thought how it's gonna be you have to dive too like type and then you come back and then you have to dive again [Applause] no it's i'm just thinking about dance walk guy because he had this in a water session but i think maybe we can close here it will be uploaded so so please like it like the video thank you for the four people liked the video last video floor and someone and my mom and the cat my cat and uh yeah we'll probably upload another one tomorrow or something we do the practice yeah so check them out tomorrow bye", "LCA43GclEQE": "all right so recording it's recording it's a good start i think hello um we are real again different place yeah wait so we can start this we have to start this with a the cookie of the fortune this is super crush right now is it i thought it would be at the end it must be wow [Music] so this is on actually anyways why this is so crushed like a mess okay dude by the way like can you eat these cookies of the fortune are eatable they're cookies they're damn cookies oh yeah you can eat it they actually are trying that yeah you want some no no i just brushed my teeth i mean i still sugar so this says sure charitable activities will stay of loneliness what charitable activities will stay what is the state of loneliness what is this state sure to stay off here of wind what is wind so so that's i don't know if you're going to volunteer yeah yeah yeah like if you do like yeah so like uh free work or charitable activities then we are not lonely no you're not alone exactly yeah cool okay i don't know if this is charitable i mean i mean we give you guys a lot of content this is more than charity somebody starts paying way too much content okay okay let's start yeah um so what did we do today we went to see this yeah i mean we took a workshop and then we went to the performance dance walk and what's the what's the name of the artist again i cannot i thought the choreographer was not there but he was there no no he was there he was yeah the guy at the end at the end yeah he appeared no what's new post football never post who for is the company or what should be yeah i think sometimes the people don't put their name you know like joe when we do sometimes he don't put his name but he just put the name of the company i see this kind of people yeah but we we use our names you know we are not best practices all the time but so what was what was the idea like well can we start uh maybe you are good at summarizing so i try and you can follow up because if you summarize then i don't have anything to add um so basically the stage set was like you know the projection was in the back and also on the floor oh yeah they were just double there were two projections yeah it's like nearer so yeah yeah the performers the performer the performer is yeah it was yeah just one person yeah the performer is uh like mostly frontal facing us so it's not a huge theater um and basically the the idea of the video was this artist who did dance walk which is about like i don't know tens of kilometers like walking and dancing at the same time and like documenting the whole process and then it was like kind of it's not really a documentary but like kind of summarizing you know like what happened during the dance walks in like different editions i don't know if it's like five or six years of process in 2015 and 15 yeah and then the video like time lapse and some videos and uh also the performer was talking about something narrating yeah sometimes yeah and uh yeah and kind of recreating mimicking what was happening during the yes so representing somehow and then somehow also talking um in an artistic way i guess what is the project about so say for instance because i thought at some point is ah this is kind of similar you know we have to explain what the project that we do is about and then we have like the text that we have that's very formal things you know it's a very formal text very understandable text and in the case of the performance then it's kind of is is being said as yeah as a poetry kind of thing yeah in an artistic way so uh the way hope she's saying what it happens is just a structure as a yeah with some dramaturgy or something there that it makes the thing a bit weird um and i don't know which exactly cities they walk but yeah i mean at first it's it's around france or you know in europe i don't know if they're based in france or switzerland somewhere around there french-speaking yeah and i i think the first videos were like more like um the artists himself like kind of really dancing while walking you know like there's some steps or like sometimes a bit like contemporary dance kind of you know like there's one edition that's like naked and yeah like the in public space and stuff like that um which was kind of i felt like that's really like a dance walk that you know yeah so this is this is actually yes this is i think but it was not from the pc itself but from the project in that sense that we can relate with from the practice you know like if somebody's gonna go let's say this saturday to i dognate and for some reason they don't like what we do or something um as in this case like somehow the performance like things uh in short i guess um but something you cannot deny is like this thing the dance walk you understand what is the dance world you know it happens it's basically somebody that walks a lot and he does what he walks so he needs he has a goal to go from point a to b while he's dancing not i mean he needs to be effective so he needs to move so he just find a way how to keep on moving and he's doing that for many years and that's something that you get as an audience that you receive like ah okay that's the dance well yeah it's a lot it's a lot of material i don't want to finish yeah but then i don't know if you want to add something more of this description oh yeah that's that's the kind of thing but um like first ones like they were kind of experimenting with like very specific specific themes like naked body or whispering uh no whistling um like there was one kind of diving in river or something or see and then it became like a little bit like less dancy in a way i found it like there's one that has the like they're like rolling a huge yarn yeah yeah string and then they're like unrolling it and that was really like a video that i it was i think the longest footage yeah yeah like the one that stays the longest yeah yeah in in british in these things that we did in the cup in the melting pot in ostendi there was this thing also a huge threat thread from the train station all the way through the city until you're right in the in the performance thing so and it was pink also so it made me thought uh think of that you see um yeah whatever it was in that film like footage it was really like not dancy in a way they were just like playing with you know like what's around and you know just like jumping on each other or like they don't have like a step so like they don't kind of try to make something they're really playful they're really playful they're really playful and that's part of the things like this when the texts uh help in saying that not because then she mentioned that it's playful uh i mean things i see a similarity from things that we do in the sense that there is in a way not really uh they're not really aiming to create like a amazing dance or something also because you're just walking for hours so even if you try to be like i don't know well the most technical dancer of whatever if you're working for five hours just it's gone you know after some time you just you just you need to walk from one city to the other city so just you just basically you are in a survival mode right the the shape or this beauty of the whatever is just gone and and you are just functional and just walking and dancing all you can and and they become very animal in this they're super cool like some footage are like yeah the photos is amazing because you can you can see that the guy or the people who are involved in the project are really um they're transformed they're completely transformed yeah they're they're the self is there this self dissociation thing that we speak and i would say uh about the piece i think that was kind of the the middle and then the last part was about it became more like activism i think like there was like this kind of starter like kind of marching or parade with many people and that's where it become like they started tour like really like worldwide in africa africa asia and yeah that part i started kind of you know question a little bit you know what is this because i mean we can talk about later but it's just like a description of the piece and then afterwards like they also came back to like france and like they put like you know for example like the artist himself like the is t-shirt a new man like human and uh you know they started to say like talk about more like a human justice stuff like this during the dance war which became really i felt found the strict activism which you know is i'm not saying it's good or bad but it's it's quite an interesting consequence let's say and there's also like this story in uh iran where uh it's prohibited to do that to dance which is kind of absurd but it is and basically they tried to hide the camera and filmed a dance walk which is not really obviously dancing but you know doing little movements and then uh i think the story was that the the curator or the director of this um dance like underground dance festival was uh arrested um banned he cannot do work anymore as an artist that i found super horrible stuff yeah i mean yeah it's that's also like kind of questionable because i think they said it's like 2 20 18 or something and they kind of continued afterwards so i don't know i mean you know obviously like they don't have to stop dancing but that's kind of things that started to find the political and the intentions um yeah so that's kind of a very opinionated summary of the piece i would say yeah i mean like for me that what i think yeah i put some notes and i in relation to what we do and then i thought one of the things i think like that it works somehow is because these there's some it's just some small things that in a way i kind of like think on that and we we talk of this like you know like the clothes the guy is always using clothes that it has the guys the guys branding what he's doing and and it's just simple he did all the time he was wearing or pants or a t-shirt with something that it says that's dan's walk and that's for me this is just on point because it's very close to this idea that we tried to do with the hashtag of best practices in contemporary dance or at least in my head with this idea of the stickers and just pushing basically the idea behind branding what is branding and design basically and marketing sorry i think my computer is super slow and i don't know if the recording is good but i don't know should i stop it and change the resolution settings yeah yeah change no okay put it 720 cool okay so we're back um i will somehow stitch the video so there shouldn't be any issue but let's see okay so we're talking about the the branding kind of thing yeah yeah so i think this is very important because for me that's part of like the i have this practice the designing art is a kind of a life project that i have is this idea of mixing design and art and in in what i think in the project what it is really catching the tension for me i think it works as a subliminal is the guys always using this thing of the dance block like this is a sticker that is there always with a qr code it's just very simple but it just it really works the the day we were talking like why we didn't put this kind of things and also and so you have that so that's one thing so this the the logo always in the clothes for five years like the recordings always or the pants maybe not very first but they kind of try to like you know no but the guy always because i checked that i was following that or in the pants or in the teacher the guy the guy who appeared at the end because not everyone was all the time but he was always with that because i was checking that and um other thing that i thought it was cool was the way how at some point the way how they start tagging the recordings because they're imagining whole they should have humongous amounts of recordings right like so many so this is related to what we were saying yesterday sometimes ago we were speaking that in a way we don't in a way have a structure in the way how we structure things we don't have we don't really structure things um and that's the way how we do um but already also yesterday we were thinking that that we want to uh we know that we have to develop what we want to go towards we want to create installation and we make these nodes you know you so we want to uh create all the from the best practices that we have make an installation so kind of like a stand-alone installation you like a classic installation that they don't need us a video from the content uh kind of branding with paper stickers posters this kind of thing also we also start speaking about that like kind of fashion if you want to print because well dance walk was doing that in a way as a branding yeah yeah but then so then so this is one thing but then the other thing that in regards to the structure that i'm trying to say is about this you know so normally in the video to the left it says that dance walk uh i don't know narobi or something but when sometimes he did it in the water or talks because sometimes the guy did it while he was in the water or when he was talking also he did want and him the way he just structure is before he put water that dance walk or talk dance walk and and just that way of structuring it's just so simple yeah that's like the i said it like edition but there's different like um different runs of the the dance move because like i the first impression i had from you know description or what foreign was talking me about the description which before we watched the performance is like i thought okay this guy is like going from one place to another and one place another which is actually the case but yeah at some point he was like experimenting with like different team which was like in water or naked yes whistle run kind of running yeah yeah talking yeah yeah yeah yeah so that was like that was nice way of um i don't know well yeah that's something we can so we can do it like you know i think it's i mean what i thought so this is one thing you know like i'm talking about the structure now that's just the structure this thing in terms of how you speak because what i'm trying to link to is this thing with the practice is because it's about a massive archive basically the guy has a massive archive we have a massive archive that we want to be utilized in different ways so then uh i found there was a very effective for instance how he marked the this thing which is what i just mentioned so that was one thing um store data collection but maybe you can talk about it a little bit on that like kind of transforming or like you know hacking the medium because basically the problem with the dance walk itself is that you cannot frame it as you know like performance for improved sense for example you know i mean maybe some kind of intervention now we can talk about that but it's not something that you can sell it as a like a one hour performance i'm very curious actually to know what the dancers uh how to say this like the thing is because yeah okay so there are two things one thing is i so for what i think is the performance no like as a totality what i see what i feel i fall asleep by the way like few times and that doesn't mean anything it means that i was tired and also that it was something bored by the thing but nevertheless i can say that what i saw was brilliant i mean i don't i wouldn't say that it's good or bad because then i will say it's just very interesting it's very it's something that i think is very interesting for what i'm for what you're doing um this is me as jorge just thinking actually what we do in our personal research but then also i can set us like more objectively thinking and also uh taking the voice of uh class that's uh he's more at the classical dancer somebody more like he's used to see more uh dance i guess more classical dance contemporaries yeah conventional is what i mean like classical contemporary dance conventional uh dance so a lot of motion um he was in a way like saying that there was so not what he was saying but what i will think objectively as a dancer let's say or he put in my position in somebody like coming to the impulse dance paying 35 years to see expecting to see i don't know people doing something yeah special or dancing spectacular something that i would think oh my god this is dance uh it's not isn't this this is not uh it is somebody as you said basically what it happens is just there is there is projection uh about all this content that is so interesting and so rich in many ways but then it's one performer who is just speaking in an artistic way about the project basically what she's doing basically in a way because i thought is maybe that's what we have to do in the in the symposium is like what she's doing is she's speaking in an artistic way about the content that the people is seeing that's it period she's just describing in an artistic way with some emotions what is happening and a part of that then you have because i put it also in my notes you have this clear because i checked that there is a kind of a bj with the video so it's not a linear video there is somebody controlling the video so then the dancer because i checked that then the dancer at some point do some things it's like i saw at least i catch like three times where the dancer is the one who's doing the queue to the guy who's controlling some layers of videos yeah i checked that so because it's kind of like djing it's controlling the so it's in real time the video is responding to the uh to the dancer and what is clear in the proposal is that sometimes uh they give a focus to the dancer by blurring the image you know something that you understand now you want me to watch that answer and then the dancer will do sometimes very few times some things they are more like please look at me or it will take a position in the state okay good so that's the third time so yes they were talking about the blurring the image that that was uh so it was literally blurring the image like yeah the blurry image i found it it was kind of effective for the first one but second one i was like oh again no anyways but i think yeah because i think there are different things no details about the piece than then what i think is important or relevant in this aspect is that because class mentioned that and i agree and what he says is that in the way we propose he says something like um [Music] i think if yeah he said literally because the projection was just in a in a classical uh canvas in the background you know just classical projection yeah and then he said maybe if they put something that instead of being white just translucent and then the dancer could be in and in the back or so on so i i don't know about that what i mean that i agree with him is that the proposal is very boring uh so did you as an audience you understand what is that you're proposing very fast so uh in the class was just basically saying i think that would be more interesting i don't know if i would agree with him but i agree that the proposal well it's it's more like he was expecting like kind of something more multimedia kind of stuff so but what i'm trying to say here is that uh in the sense of like i agree with him in the sense like as a critique of the piece as let's say just as critique of the pieces uh yeah could have like i guess the structure could have been i don't want to go there actually because this is not really interesting for what we're saying but let me try to finish this what and what i'm are you recording a little bit uh i'm checking if the sound is actually recorded uh should i just try to stop that okay so this is the fifth time now you're going forth fourth time and next time i'm gonna have to do something yeah man wait so let's do this like okay okay are you talking you know what you know what yes like what i found in don't rub too much um what's really hard in real life is i it's it's hard to find written to be honest like like zoom is fine to find but what do you mean like reading with one of the conversation because i'm not good at cutting the you know someone talking in real life especially oh and i can let you go on for like forever because that is because then i just speak and speak and speak yeah yeah yeah you know because also like now we're not looking at each other kind of so is it's so hard so let's slow down a bit um but let me try to close what i'm saying and then no you don't have to um so what i but this thing with um i really get what uh curse was saying and that was kind of the question i had that does it have to be good because you were talking about the you know the movement and movement and you know video uh mixing and stuff but also like the video was really not good right no no of course not like the text and this it's just like the quality was horrible it's like home videos yeah yeah of course yeah and and also you know like dance was like you know not something that's like you know stand out um but it's just the piece is a piece because of the whole research and how everything is connected but although every piece is not really something that's you know at the that level with don't i mean i i'm not on position to criticize that but yeah you see that this kind of amateur thing because different parts of it yeah yeah but i think well i think what i have to say with this is that uh because i understand i don't know but actually people will get what you're saying but i completely understand from where it comes what you're saying uh what i have to say in that regard i'm sure is that yes but so i can agree with you partially but what i cannot pass from my from my view like what i would like what i can not pass is that the the demand of the attention like as an audience it demands way too much attention uh because it's in a black box uh is basically showing that but class there is a documentary so it's basically you have to see this very interesting footage that is very long it's interesting but it's yeah it's a guy who is dancing walking that's it there is no more happening than that uh so in that case um i think the proxy what i'm saying is like what i cannot pass is that the black box thing it was just too hard for me i fall asleep it's just it's just too hard so i understand you said because i can take us the piece as kind of interesting for what we do so that's why i agree but you said i said it's a good piece it is a good piece but i cannot pass if i for what i'm doing from my aesthetics and understanding in our research is like an audience needs to rest from that if it's just that they are we need you need to give back agency to the audience but in the black box is different that's why normally you need to put or what the class proposed or you need to do something that i don't know if it's good or bad but i would say maybe yeah this is not the point here trying to say what i will do or not but what i cannot pass from there what i see there is a problem is like the black box in the piece is a problem because the man's detention you're sitting watching that yeah true i mean um besides all these things i said it was a bit long for what it is [Music] yeah this was a bit long like first part it was quite like engaging in a way like also like you see the development of you know how he's like as i said like it was really interesting he's like really dancing at first and then he transforms to like more super cool um let's say animal right yeah something transformed it's playful it's playful there yeah and then this activism part which i don't know but you know this but you follow it but you know it at a certain point it becomes a bit repetitive in a way and it's kind of as you said it's i don't know if i would really like this you know just watch it but that's that's the point where i connect this with the best practice because if you think what we do if we do a live streaming of six hours and if we do the practice itself for two hours we repeat a lot of the things that we do i mean the change is just but we are not support i'm not expecting somebody watching for two hours so that's the problem that for example like in the symposium we have i don't know an hour an hour and a half or something yeah how do we deal with this really should we like bring some snacks or like what no they i think we have to deal with that there like that will be because we would be in a vulnerable state there because we cannot be protected by basically like it would work if we you know like bombard people with information i like the magazine like things that can just pass around different things that they are not yeah but like magazines just you know maybe you can spend a few minutes you can read but it's just one book so i don't know like we can we have to think about well but actually it could be a good idea you know like kind of like create things around the practice you know like there are some things in the practice we can bring so we can have elements kind of like an installation of the you put the magazine you put the stickers like that's not a bad idea at all because it relaxes the people from that because yes absolutely tell them you know if you you can just go out yeah we're gonna go this so basically yeah we say like we're gonna do this for one hour after one hour we're gonna talk about what is it but just feel free to go in and out because this is a practice and might be super good or might be super bad in three minutes or in ten minutes maybe i'm keep changing obs and you know yeah yeah no but that's a super good idea then then then we have to take the t-shirts i think we have to do the teacher now i'm more convinced of this like just any kind of like goodies you know like the people something that people just don't do this too much because it sounds getting so nervous sorry um you know like i was also thinking about it yesterday at the park because you were like playing with the nails at the end i was like no don't do this for the time but anyways yeah but but i think we can try you know different medium maybe we can bring some snacks uh if you want uh it will be cool actually we can make a fortune cookies it's too late but you know like if some artists making fortune cookies with uh uh you know like you print out the message and you can make your own fortune cookie it's so cool to have like this cookie of fortune but all of them they say the same best practice in gothenburg or something from the document maybe like hashtags like hashtags hashtags they'll be nice could be cool you know what could be cool like that we could pre we could have different prints you know like the magazines for instance very nicely layout of the text uh that we wrote together with joanna there are two texts there the layout is in two pages in the color yeah and if the color is very nice the font is very nice like we can select that actually is a good idea that uh there will relax the people in that way relax ourselves because you know if something is not happening on the computer they can still see something i can bring some coffee i'll be so cool i think that was the easiest way in a way that's actually if martin c martin is here by the way i will send him a message also martin martin spumber isn't what i mean is martin isn't martin is founders in the influence and we read some of these texts and so we i will send a message to invite him to the symposium i don't know if he'll appear or not but what i'm saying with is that we cannot hack part of these things that of the just they put in the snacks the drinks and stuff um [Music] yes i think it's a good idea and then just we said anyway in the in the in the email the we said like bring your laptop it's not the it's not the end of the war if you don't bring your laptop you bring your drinks i don't know we provide something how many so you're weak as well some bottles of something and some cups we just have to provide something something something because that's what i was thinking the food that maybe the food actually i don't know how much about the idea of the food because if that's 300 people have to pay for 200 people food even the snacks will be costly yeah just pay prices and catering uh but then i i really think it's a good idea to i will so rather than buying food actually i'm more in that because that's more close to what we're doing now it's like rather than buying food i will pay with my own money for four t-shirts you know like uh something like that and different colors just because it's just somehow if somebody asked me what are you doing that i don't know you're like i don't know but i just i feel is right and actually when i see this performance i just absolutely feel this it's just it feels right to do it for there's a reason in that i don't know what is it but i just feel it's right it feels in my guts it feels right the stickers that you were now to was the one who start working with the the nice stickers that we start putting around the impulse dance um it's gonna be everywhere so and that's cool because in a way this is really that thing is related you remember to joanna you wanna at some point you joanna chicao was that you're there hello by the way i saw that one of the hashtag when you're typing in google hashtag best practice and contemporary dance one of the shows is is joanna in twitter i didn't know she said like we are live or something yeah and i thought that was super sweet thank you very sweetheart uh that she did it when we invited her that she put that we are live live always practice life or something that's super nice of her so but what i was trying to say of joanna is that joanna was the the person who started talking or i remember in my head in this conversation about tracing or like polluting the the web you know polluting tracing like leaving traces in the in the web after having that conversation with i think what could be one the first conversation with her i started thinking really i wish you we should really start like polluting the web but this idea of polluting so basically it's about visibility of the web now this is how i see it this is part of the same ideas polluting the world with with how we can with an installation with fashion with videos with performances um because at the core i feel is is something uh good yeah and interesting for other people to see a thing maybe not good i would say interesting for other people to see yeah i don't know because well i think that's kind of the you know good way of um like polluting the web is a good way of you know becoming famous on the web because you know otherwise you will be like you have to be an influencer or something that's just you know feeding more content to instagram or facebook whatever but if you're like really like trying to produce something i like i think the good example is uh um like when things on twitter like when there's like kind of like racism hashtag appears uh some um some fans of korean band they start like tweeted with those hashtags with uh with their you know like images or like gif of the korean band to literally pollute the hashtag i think i really like that idea i mean we're not doing that same same thing but you know i i see something seeming some kind of similarity it's also playful maybe it's the playfulness that's what i want to say okay i see anyways yeah i think i'm just dramatic i said it because you said it's playful i please keep it playful i like drama [Music] but maybe we can close soon this chat i think yeah i don't know if anything else i mean i can we can go on but i think we should record tomorrow again and uh because i don't know if chris is yeah anyways um so we're going to a source to socialize yeah to the launch and i have to put the videos together i hope that everything and also so and also then because i have to answer also from email to the editor also but uh why are we talking to the camera anyway so we're closing but wait no i want to say so i just wanted to say that this is weird man like i mean i don't feel weird that we were talking you know like because we do this without recording anyway but when you because we were just testing the the the sound of the video i found was just so weird you know like just seeing ourselves together in the video divided no divided it's just weird i mean we can try that too you know we can have like two computers together no no no no we did have that in note but i think now we can go to the same room but we just like only record one sound like one person is muted and person's not no because i think that no i think it does i think it's part of what i thought it's interesting because this is odd for us we are not used to we are putting ourselves in a new in a new situation here like being in the same place yeah this is not safe what we're doing this is not this is still super weird this is this is weird like being i know i know you i mean now i can talk to you i have no problem but then seeing the video of this is weird ah look at the frames uh there's like a frame image just you and me like when they're clicking maybe maybe in our documentary oh the other i think one thing i really want to say about the performance is it's really important that not the you know the creator of the dance walk was on the stage like no he was not doing that but the other dancer was doing it i think that's really bummer now something but did you find it interesting or like um i don't necessarily think it i mean it's i don't think it's good or bad i would say it's interesting i wouldn't okay what i will say is that the intention of putting somebody in the stage was a good idea but the way how it was executed in the choreography it was it didn't work somehow no that was really you know it's just not good uh yeah because in a way if we talk back to like that's the way how you bypass the politics you know then you don't deal with him exactly because that i mean that could be also something that can potentially this piece to become something or just a really bad thing you know yeah i mean also like for me what would be problematic is you know this white guy doing this again you know white guy and then like the last part was really horrible with them and then why did that i don't understand why they tell the story that by the way when we were in iran the guy who helped us it was in jail he lose his job and now he cannot work anymore but now we keep on walk dancing yeah it's a little bit weird also like this kind of you know like kind of parade you know kind of thing with people it becomes like you know it's it's something different it's not like maybe it's a matter of authorship but in a way like he's of course like he's motivating people in a way but it's not like his work anymore and it doesn't have to be his work but like it feels like you know he's like a guru of this whole thing it becomes like a kind of cult in a way which but you think so that i cannot tell you the way but that i cannot say because we in the images that we see we never see somebody talking you know they were always just like parade or dancing so this about what you said of the cold that i cannot i cannot say i don't really think that in that way but i feel like you know because it's it's effort of like people it's not his creation anymore i mean it doesn't have to be his creation but are they are the people like acknowledged you know like enough or not this kind of starts to get a bit tricky for me yeah okay and i'm not saying like this this was badly executed but start to feel weird and then if if you say that okay they are actually feeding the content to him then it becomes like help but not sure i mean not the cult but the power balance is really weird i would say yeah yeah that's something you know so like the first half of the piece was really like interesting it was very interesting really kind of start to turn around but also like i feel they needed some kind of change like for example they like worked on a specific theme like you know the color they started with that's the things that they think was just not good yeah i mean but that was like okay so i'm not judging what they did but i can't understand that they had to work on like different themes because otherwise it would just get stuck in like something i didn't understand because if they start to like do the same thing all over and over and over then you mean like if they keep on just doing the first nice part it was it kind of i mean as a practice if they you know just walk with you know this thing this thing that thing then maybe even if they change the you know whistle to talk to whatever but maybe i mean actually if you think i don't i mean i cannot think for the guy because i don't know him but if you think for instance like maybe if he could have done on the impulse dance uh i think this is the premiere by the way this is the because so this is the world premiere of this show so and it was i think supposed to do it last year because yes the first the title was saying you know 2020 it got crossed in 2021 yeah but what i was trying to say with that is that it means that i guess the impulse on somehow somebody the creator they decide what he's doing with the videos i guess it's interesting and i guess the guy they did so he was commissioner or someone maybe he was working on a piece but they didn't saw the piece because there was no peace but so the the world premiere will be in the impulse dance right what i'm saying with that is that maybe he got he i think i will have just take the risk of not trying to make i think he was trying to make good looking good uh the piece i think he was trying to do a good work uh at the end you see what i mean i see and i think that's why it failed because maybe if you could just like keep on doing somehow the practice that he has on the stage somehow taking the risk of not doing the dance because he just present what he present was a dance in a theater right so something that is can can be presented in a black box so maybe if he could just have take the risk of i'm just gonna do my practice somehow in this black box maybe it will have been a disaster but but it could have been uh very very something actually that's something we're trying to do in the symposium yeah in a way yeah it's a it's a kind of frame but we try to do the same thing which is a different i mean because also i mean the thing is that this uh that's part of the things that we want to know we have we have to put it in the document is like we've been asked to create a performance for a blackboard ah we have this idea with the chat that's a performance yeah that's a performance i think i think we should keep sandbox outside the stage i don't know for now at least so we talked about the idea of like transforming the chat into a performance performance in a way yeah but what i just want to say is not don't make the practice as a performance because the practice itself as a performance then that's something to become something will be really wrong no but i think like then you know okay but i think maybe just the time we'll say like i think a good a good at a step in that direction is do the chat that would yeah that would be a progressive thing that would be a choreography that that can be presented in a black box sure sure yes arguing with this but yeah yeah yeah um yeah yeah but we have to find kind of to make it yeah playful in a way and so so this dance work was really nice i mean as a as a whole i think it's nice reference for us i think it was it was on point i think it was on point on things it was very interesting for us so a part of all the criticism is a constructive uh guy you guys it was a very very interesting word that you you're doing how many stars uh i think would listen to it um you can do it i'm not gonna do it i'm gonna do it i'm not gonna do it uh yeah yeah okay but we can close here uh thank you guys now to we'll put together these five videos four yeah and then you bring his surface comfortable we have to see tomorrow how we're gonna stream from your computer because like that's fine but we did it with this before no the live streams we'll figure it out we'll see tomorrow let's see okay thank you like the nails by the way and then also uh yeah the merchandise coming soon somewhere ciao", "utvgxFZkaoY": "okay so hello hello beautiful people we are in vienna and so this is weird because normally you see us in a different format yeah so maybe it's a bit too far i don't know let's put it closer so this is the second time that i see for real now yes it's very funny we have more than 180 hours of content so if we have think about if we have more than 180 hours of content how much time because we don't upload everything that we when we need you know so how many hours how many hours should we have of conversation a lot and this is the second time that we meet uh nice to meet you not nice to meet you my pleasure but let's let's keep the you know the how do you say this this thing uh what what is this and stuff like that yeah let's not let's not talk too much because it's a chat and this is not work so we're here why why are we here we were invited for [Applause] yeah i mean kind of yeah we said you know we're gonna give a talk and then they invited us yeah the idea was so at some point we found that there were this co-founder that they were doing that what who found about this thing no because i i subscribed to the imprisoned newsletter and at some point because you know i don't subscribe myself in 2017 i unsubscribe i still think later yeah because of the historical reasons i have some connections somehow we have some clinics yeah i cut my connections into in 2017 apparently and then yeah and i knew that the symposium i i knew about it yeah yeah but i never attended sorry about that probably but you know i think it's nice to present something at impulse and that's kind of the one of the what what i thought when i saw that it was like the way i saw it i don't know still like too much about what is it but when i saw it like it seems there was a place where people go and really research about methodologies in teaching that's what i understood and dance so and then you have these images of like people were not like young dancers let's say but more mature people more with gray hair so if it was very interesting to see like they have a lot like the pictures that i saw they have physical stuff you know like uh some pictures like i don't know doing like weird an interesting thing and it just sounds to me like when i saw this i thought like anyway i want to go and participate of the symposium yeah and then we just said like let's just write him as an open call kind of thingy but already i knew like if if they don't invite us like i want to come and see what is this because it was our research yeah it's funny that yeah like this their open call was never open because when i graduated like to say okay your open call said like we released information in march end of april or something and i was contacting in may like this is not happening and at some point it answered more like uh we would like you guys to come and share this thing yeah yeah they the only thing they ask is are you coming to vienna or not so we said yes we are coming to vienna and then we go we go to slaughter yeah i think so that's exciting it's on the 31st yeah of july in yeah in a few days yeah yeah and so with the idea that today we just heard that paul the guy who i was in contact is not coming because he is something with kobe like many people um but today i'm really excited to go to meet uh the people from i talked the e because i don't know yeah i'm very excited just to go and talk with them because it seems to me there is something you know like that's very focused in order in dance workshops or in performances but this is very about research yeah it's a bit different like we were talking yesterday like you know before like if you were like working at the dancer you know you have you want to be successful and you want to be you know have next opportunities and you know you want to be big basically or if you're a choreographer but i took these a little bit different kind of motivation yeah i think it seems more like you know when you are happy for whatever you do that's the way i feel and what we do that that is just yeah it's a different thing because it's not trying to to the way i feel is not trying to really reach out to look at me in a way or uh well yeah i mean it's it's a bit of both but it's not that we we want to use this for net well it's kind of networking but you know it's not that we have to show it to curators and stuff like that it's not we need to we want to show best practices and next in person which will be funny though at uh how to folks how how funny would be like to create a a performance for something that is not supposed to be a performance but that's the thing now like in general like dance you mean no not not like what we do but for the contemporary dance scene it's not like on the stage it's dancer i mean there is there are performances like that but there are also like performances that try to do it as an installation or i okay like breaking down yeah but it's still still like the the idea will be it's very there's a train passing yeah can you show the tree there you go high-speed train high-speed train i see probably doesn't delay so much compared to apparently there is a stop here okay but we'll continue somehow so yeah but even if it's like installation like durational performance kind of thing they have to frame it so that they can sell it to other festivals right because there is there is this idea of this i was reading an article about there is thing is a concept called how is something like object-based performance or something is basically the idea that behind before you start doing a creation you know that you will have a product so like that's the way big companies work you know like before you before you agree now in a way before of having a performance you have the performance i mean that's the you sell the performance and you create you work towards a creation so you're working towards something that is gonna be something yeah i mean anyways you need it like if you want to you know write for grants and you know these things you have to have some kind of frame at least but i think there's a difference maybe that's the thing is that the difference between uh i will sell in adobe and the performances or like more the regular flow of the festival is that research in the research you can apply and say we are going to do a research and you and you can apply you can say like what is your research and maybe you don't have an outcome of the research is there maybe it's just the research itself but in the performance people are expecting that at some point you're going to show something right but then it's totally wrong i don't know what kind of people we meet so we'll see that's the impression we have so far and but we still don't know what we're going to present right [Music] [Laughter] no idea but i was thinking today actually thinking that since we always work remotely so then i was thinking that perhaps could be interesting to then anyway so be in a place that you and me the same place where the people are but maybe invite to the people to bring their laptops then the people can be at the same time that could be interesting you know like not everybody has laptops that we can set if you can bring your laptop and then we have in a way we are in the stage or in front whatever that we are people can see what we do but at the same time people have their own view of what is happening online see yeah that would be interesting that the in a way that there are different screens all over the place yeah i see and that in the way that then we bypass the complexity of if we have two beamers one beamer of all these kind of things true yeah because i i had a feeling that if we so one idea was you know we could say we have a projector and show one of us or you know both somehow and show it as a screen but then that's a little bit different i think would be nice like the idea of the laptops also because yeah it gives i i work with a choreographer called andre that you met the last time when i went to this dinner andre yeah we worked in a project in finland that it was he was working there was a around the gesture of filming yourself that was the whole thing and i think what was interesting the concept is that you have uh the possibility of going your phone and see what is happening but at the same time is happening in front of you so it gives you a completely uh different feeling and also give you the gives back agency to you as a viewer you decide i'm gonna watch the people who are in front of me as people that's in common flesh or i'm gonna watch through the screenplays and decide how do the stage design of yourself how i place this as an audience as an audience yeah and i think that's interesting because then it goes in line to what we do in the sense of giving back agency to the to the viewer right not telling what is the most interesting thing and it's just the people who need to find what is there for them i see yeah yeah we really have to have a good network we'll see y5 yet so this practical thing is that we have to talk with them like we need to see what is possible yeah but we can try and if it doesn't work we'll see if there's anything else yeah we just put a hard drive in the middle just explore our videos that's another thing that at some point we said you know like because this is uh we are talking about something there is like real time in in a way like so yeah but that we have to think at some point or for you now for for other applications how in a way to create an installation if you want something that is there without the need to for us to be there right it's like an idea on installation basically how to create an installation somehow yeah yeah i mean that connects to the archive right yeah yeah this is like i i think keep thinking about it but we haven't had time to work on it so yeah we were both busy for some time but but maybe it's actually something we could discuss during the symposium because they must have some people should have like different practices they could be organizing that question for them actually how will somebody create from this an installation yeah you know or how do they you know archive the the movement this is more vague question that also connects to the installation idea because i'm pretty sure they're not like you know just film it and show it like probably they have something beyond that yeah because in what we do then what i think when we talk about uh archive and then we call this like an active archive is this idea behind that in a practice then sometimes we will use uh past archive material as background or things like that and in that way so then the archive material becomes active or alive so but in that in this example still you have the real-time thing that is not the case i mean there is i i would be interested in finding a way how to create an installation that is a real-time yeah yeah sorry i was distracted because i was checking the new now festival and we are we're on it finally finally so it's we can talk about it and uh there are quite a lot of famous artists like us so it's actually i mean there are quite a lot of people like from node new tech kind of crowd yeah it's uh it's exciting and it of course improves sunsets there are famous people i don't know can you send the link to it and what's up afterwards sure yeah i can do it now actually but it's like this was a bit random but we always talk about the visibility and somehow it's starting to work something that i was thinking today now also is i thought because i was uh that would be good if we do it in all the archive material i can have you one with that you have to give me your password then to put in every time like a hashtag you see because now when i when i hashtag it i just see like the videos that i love with my channel because i use the hashtag but all the videos are in yours yeah so i think that will take some time yeah but then to put in all of them the hashtag and when you google the hashtag that is what basically we are putting around in the importance then people they just like what is this hashtag best practices in contemporary dance and they just see the bunch of things yeah at least for the last ones i i try to put the best practices contemporary dance and some random hashtags around it but it would be nice to to put in all of them yeah what yeah i think it's good that you added the hashtag to the page which means yeah so i think if you search for uh best practices and temporary does without space then that shows up at the top and then there are a few related contents yeah what i when i checked today i see like the first thing that appeared in my search list was the twitter my twitter account best practices contemporary dance the only thing it's just hard to type best practice in contemporary dance oh and there's a idoc the hybrid doc if i search on duckduckgo but if i search on google i don't know what else shows up oh it's my my blog as well the nautojira.com this one article that i wrote actually it's a really old one like last like around this time last year i wrote one like a summarize you know what where we started what was the academic paper that you did no but because that shows up on google i thought like maybe i should just keep editing that page like i so i added like a new contents or the write up from you know the the one we always use with the massive archive blah blah i think yeah it's a fluid discourse um so that i added that text and uh i'll keep updating that so that shows up but i think like this is a bit connected to what we just talked in the in the in the breakfast uh let me try to with this sure so i think there is something fundamentally wrong in the way how we're uh uh hashtagging or like let's say we don't have really a structure or how we're doing this and that's why this fundamentally wrong way of like no methodical way of doing this thing i think is good in the sense of it's just not a structure you know so then you will find so many things that i mean we didn't plan to do it in that way but then for reason like i was not expecting to see the twitter account my twitter account i never used that but for some reason appears there and i think it's nice like all this mess in a way i think it's cool yeah because i think it has to be with this idea of since we are not trying to do it good or right that's why we just do it like this and works and and it relieves the tension of succeeding in a way like are we doing this good yeah yeah totally yeah like it's how do i say it like also like i started to kind of do this practice like not to first frame like how to uh collect the data like am i working with like images or of my working with text is you know kind of vague but really strict um how to say frame but i just collect things and you know uh maybe i start like even i start with actually web page where i put all the things because you know if you're working with for example like a database then you have to have a structure yeah yeah proper structure what is the name you put a tag category a time but if you work with a web page you can just put whatever on it and then you start to see some kind of you know maybe similarities or whatever that could work as a structure so it's kind of flipped the um like outcome and this database structure i think what is cool from that is that in a way then at the end then because there is not because it's not structured then you don't have control at the end of what is happening you know it just basically is it's going to once we decide that it's uploaded there is almost every time when we do a practice that's just it's uploaded it's it's out of our hands you know it's just out and because yeah there is not a structure then it's just it takes the shape that it needs to take and if some people watch more certain things because they found them in their own way and but i think the other thing that i think is cool is because this has this changed constantly if you find a document maybe six months ago and now you find a document like now it's completely different like i mean there are different things it's not the same thing yeah also like we often talk about you know how people receive it but it's also like two of us working together in the best practices so we see it in different ways which is good so and we don't have to agree on it no no no and i think that's something that i was thinking that for the idol is important in a way to show like to talk what is actually the story behind like uh like what is because in a way for in the way how i see it personally then i connected uh very much in the research that i do for my school so far as i was doing my research at some point with 3d images and stuff like that and at some point and just we decided that for the school i would do it in this way with the best practices and so i have a personal view in the way i'm seeing the work that is different from yours although we both are working together and i think it's interesting to to see how how how basically what it what what what was your path since the moment you start and where are you now from this thing and what is my path also from what i start and what is my path now and where are we now new now i know i got like new now so this is the new now that i'm here now should we close now or we i don't know like i feel like it's so different from like talking on zoom yeah it's the first time like we did it this way like we didn't do it at node no we talked so much we talked on online even if we were on like for we had a chat i we have two series like in because they were scheduling the in the program to do it but we did it online so we talked a lot but we did never recorded it and probably this sound is horrible i have to i think i have to take the sound from the microphone because i think you don't hear it on the microphone the camera anyways do you like manner man the way the vapor thing give me the format no the the it's a brand i just saw it on the train because it has uh you know this pink color you know the packaging oh yeah like it's some kind of sound called sound color yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah my house has a very similar color okay yeah i like it but do you like the this wafer chocolate thing no no i don't know which one is it it's played for you you never had it glitch because it's quite like the package is quite obvious with that color and then uh there's this um oh they sell actually one is like a bag and one another one is like a you know the really square package thing that has wafers and like like sandwiches like chocolate cream hazelnut so you have to have it yeah because it's from here i think yes by the way now otto has very good coffee always yeah because uh at node i didn't drink i didn't have it i have mine yes i remember that's why i bring this i have my nail polish oh so that was that i think we should just keep it uh recording and then we'll be talking yeah nice uh so i have these two colors be careful with the noise also i might use i may not i don't know whatever can you maybe help me to do my nails like now like no i have to clean it first ah you cannot do it like this okay i don't do it now no i can do it but yeah so maybe use this tree when did you start painting your nails uh when was it 2018 and i have three years of experience three years of experience yes well end of 2018 actually and at first i tried the press on nails okay you know this little chip you put it on yeah but then like i was like why not just do it my with my fingers i have my hairs and you're good in that you're really calm yeah you're secure with your yeah but i think i had coffee so what i like to put like these uh layers in tomb but they're not clean is that you have this kind of uh map thing you know uh feeling because there is the shadow on there so it looks like a map it's good yes it's very good thank you very much you're welcome so that's that oh yeah maybe just here and here i really like it yeah i i started like because i met some artists from germany they are really into that well actually they have like one of them really has like this kind of like she really likes to scratch nails so it's always looks really horrible but anyways i i don't do that so they they chose me a color for me and uh that was the light blue so since then i used light blue it's a good color for you yeah yeah green is a different difficult color i mean for yeah to suit but i was thinking also like we have you ever think like we never have to really talk of this idea of colors when we do the practices right but in somehow it's true like that without talking it's very often that i will end up using more red colors yeah and then you will use somehow like more blue or something like that yeah and we never agree on that that's super fast that'll go super but i really like that color but that goes really fast yeah i see uh yeah the colors yeah we never talk about it no that's true we need to find a color specialist and talk about good color for us but also i think like so far the way i see it colors and what we do is that basically something that i think we can agree upon is at some point we said like when we show uh let's say we have our bodies in the space in the in our own studios and let's say and there is a background uh there is there is or the chroma key or something that is just simple and that's something that in a way we kind of agree like we don't show that uh because i call that as like a naked body or something uh and in a way so then we just show the image once is a bit more corrupted right yeah so the colors in a way goes in with that idea like to in a way it's functional without thinking you know like it it has the function of covering my normal self my normal color or your normal color true is to not show just naoto as when now to say hello to me but i used to say now to own the practice which is not the same in auto asthma yeah yeah it's true nail polish it's like a nail polish yeah yeah i feel completely yeah i think i like this analogy it's a it's a good analogy yeah i feel completely different uh with the nail polish and every time will be different yeah and also like true well some people change colors a lot but you know you kind of stick to like same yeah more or less yeah and that's because that's that's when you are living as yourself but then if you're in the practice you can have different colors of like i tried different colors nails but at one point i was doing it you're trying at some point green ones green ones i have pink white yellow but that's like not my normal self it's the sandbox the and we should actually never thought about the sandbox idea because we're in a park here we are next to the sandbox literally so we can just play i mean this is just yeah we are next to the sun so i'm a bit lost but yeah playing with different colors in the practice but not in the normal life outside sandbox i think it's something to somewhat think about anyways it's very challenging i mean that it's what was i think could be so good when i was thinking like this ccl the ccl is gonna happen in berlin and that could be interesting like it's like sharing basically a sandbox now like yeah where people can actually just jump in and do things within the sandbox yeah what do you offer sandbox sounds cool i think motion bank people will be happy but at the same time i feel a bit afraid of like the same books we need to basically just like to buy people uh and try that with people you know we define just this is the sandbox yeah i mean you know like for instance like because like straightforward will be like almost if you invite somebody is then you uh like when i when i was going on today i show him basically this is step one two three uh one two three and from there then just you go you change things just not too much and you move uh so kind of like an extra instruction manual like how to access that um which works completely if somebody is not really comfortable with other things you know uh but if people are more comfortable already with this software or these uh technologies um it will limit their possibilities you know if if you tell them like this is the step one two three four then just get stuck yeah i mean that's yeah that's a big question then that's yeah it's hard because you need something and but but we have to know that we have both like you know background like i mean i work with those things and you work with uh what is called bdmx and this you know video mixing i mean you do vj so you we kind of share that already although we don't use the same software but if let's say like we go to like ccl maybe because you know some people have already the practice with the videos but then they don't have practice with body maybe i think something that that is like we didn't really we haven't really talked or think about it but it's it's embedded in what we do is that is this idea of the real-time stuff in terms of like video uh production say that and that was part of the conclusions of one of the things that i put in my magazine is like whether with nanji pekka when he started like doing these things uh with video art or these things when video art you will create effects of things like that but those things are made in post-production yep so there is a clear intention before you that there's a clear intention how you're going to do something afterwards um and i think in what we do we do a similar we do changes so we do effects on the image we corrupt the image but it's in real time so the real time is we never talk of this because in a way it's like granted but it's very uh important in the in in that yeah yeah no that's something i one of the practices when i used the mirror's cutting down video i made with my dungeon pack verse by mars that's super interesting because as you said it's post-production but what we do is kind of like there's a lot of similarities in the video that you know yeah it's like moving and then you know keys like uh position changes um and there's like he's like walking or like running uh in the background of the you know moving video like took taken from the train or car whatever and there's like so many things we did i mean of course they did it so much earlier with less technology basically because i don't know how they did the the post-production but it's of course it's so much so much challenging than we do it today so we cannot compare it but but the interesting thing is they try to find some kind of framework like kind of a methodology let's say that's how they frame the piece because you know this choreography was made by mr mers cunningham specifically for tv frame or something and that's something that they it's not that they just produce something but also it sounds like there's like research i think like something that if i cancer that i think there is a similarity in this and i i stand on that point is that if you compare that one like the image like there's a uh video of ninja pegs and what we do is that there is the intention of being grounded uh to be to do something new you know like to really force and push and say this is new you know i don't know if he did it like in or like to succeed or something but it's something that is clearly is like pushing and saying this is new and that's something that i stand for when i was talking with somebody in rome two days ago and then there was a choreographer who was more used to work with i guess more classical things uh he was saying that this is could be i guess more specific for people so like this my it's a micro niche so like very just for not for everyone in a way to enjoy i guess our practice yes and then there is a train again and yeah but i i stand in this point of like i don't know if what we do is good or bad because then there are so many practices and then you can like one practice because it's good because of the colors that we decide or the internet with fruit or the music or the dancing or you can dislike it because of the same reasons and another one so you are you can be completely biased and but what i think is relevant from practice is there is a it just proposes something new that is just not trying to be good it's just something new it's just something new that it maybe give i think that's yeah but i'm trying to say like the the similarity that i see is like in both cases i think it's it just gives the possibility for maybe other things to become you know i think in the way i write it is like the one of the conclusions that i have in my research in my paper was like the the main answer is not a final answer but but instead the promise of something yet to come every time practicing the best practice in contemporary dance that was literally the thing that i grew then i wrote my heart it was like so steaming from because i put some questions the main question is like there is not an answer but yeah it's just the promise of something yet to come that it comes every time won't be practiced and it's not the final answer but it will come every time and if somebody is trying to do something in relation to it it will come something yeah and in that case i think it's similar because then the words of nancy peck gives the possibility so all this video are to happen yeah and also like in other words because we work with the medium itself right it's not like we work with the content i mean we work with the content in every practice but the whole thing is about the working with this medium and that's where it can allow other things to happen and in regard to ccl what i've seen so far with ccl is basically you come with your tools and you want to work with the content because you meet new people and make something new but it's it's more about you know you already have your body your tools software and you try to you know fit some like ideas and make something which is a bit different from the which is completely different for practice but we can go to that direction too but like what other people can do from the tools that we have sure i don't think that's really interesting but that's kind of you feel safe i don't know yeah i don't know we have time we have to think about the idol d first you know in essen on september sunday [Music] so i guess we wrap up around here yeah we can do that it's actually hard to talk to the camera i'm not looking at the camera so much it's very different from the video call yeah but we'll get used to it so yeah please [Music] like the video like the nails the nails subscribe and share this with others and what else come to idope come to new now come to ccl whatever okay yeah and i think we try to publish like a lot during this week videos so let's check them out i think i'm just gonna we should just have to bring this on all the time the recording yeah true but no editing no it the next video will make 24 hours video okay thank you", "Cr3O4BuRoDE": "hello so so we just spoke a lot about the cyber manifesto and you missed it but now we are talking we are talking now now about saying something that i'm going to uh it's it's called silicon friend camp or something like that silicon friend silicon frame silicone friend camp wow i don't like this i don't like why they put the silicone in front well i have no idea i mean an iron is an irony that's an irony to silicone yeah i think so i mean they they took a photo of the mountains and they say this is a silicon valley but let's see oh i okay yeah yeah i mean like what you said which you missed but um yeah that's that's not you working the viewers missed um yeah or you can be jorge as well uh as a viewer i don't know what i would say you know that exactly like what you said is something i would be interested i mean that's kind of the big problem also because i think most of us most of us it's weird most of the people in the group are from europe um white i think and then you know gathering and then talk about robots that like what is it like robots and ai and you know like obviously there's like this confrontation or something like maybe that's a bit too much but i i always feel it and you know um i mean it's also the narrative of this this whole thing as silicon friend camp talking about robots in the mountains proposed by white people proposed by people living in linz which is something in in the digital art is you know they kind of have already had this clear standpoint where they want to start with and like they have the background of whatever that is happening there whatever they they have seen they have been involved and then you know i'm japanese and i'm not kind of in the digital art scene i would say i mean i mean i'm outsider let's say so that's something i mean it's nice that uh other um japanese friend will be there also there's one um participant i think she's brazilian uh working in the uk uh which i think is very interesting in the group because i think uh maybe there's another chinese girl um but yeah like that's like you know only like a few out of 15 people or something is from outside uh europe your eurocentric world so let's see how it's gonna happen i don't i don't want to you know say anything more than that but that's obviously right before now to get kicked out of the camp so he just arrived and he just arrived tomorrow like okay by the way we watch your chat yesterday very inappropriate what do you say or or the other other option is after the camp i will be baptized oh yeah but you know i was thinking because after um i i have this uh when like one week ago when i was thinking about like gender and this identity of being male or being female and and then at some po i mean it's in regards to the same thing like there are some topics that say uh i think it's in regards also hard ways like basically what i'm sharing with naoto is like what it makes the cyber manifesto interesting back in time and i think it still is right now is the approach of speaking about something very serious which in that case was with an ironic tone to not define a position where one speaks up with or from the truth you know and then we go back to when we speak about the truth and which is something that in western politics or in philosophy you're it's very present you know like who has the absolute truth or i know you don't know you shut up because i know more than you and this kind of things and then i think in the practice then what i was thinking is how i mean how can one in a way mention a topic without hijacking uh without without making the let's say the practice the events you know when in the practice we we speak about like in a way it's not a political statement or we try to not make it heavy in that sense they practice it itself but it's a different space nevertheless like i think i think it's just if one is uh grounded of what is happening in its own life i think this question will pass there you know like this if it's for some reason i have some questions in those days about gender somehow it should be reflected in my practice without the need to stop and start speaking about judith butler or whatever is it that i need to speak or you know what i mean yeah i totally understand and i think that's what we do but this is hard um i don't know why no because i think it's like do people do that like we do it but i don't know like if other people are doing something like that not being like explicit about something but somehow manifests manifests through but through what i mean i mean what what jorge said to me it totally makes sense because that's exactly how i feel as well during practice i mean not during practice but reflecting in the practices but is that something that people actually understand or it doesn't have to be understood yeah i just know i have this i remember i have this conversation with one of the dancers of melting pot some time ago when we finished some project in april and then the guys from brazil so he's i think he's moved he moved to europe maybe two years ago and luis if you see this which i doubted hello uh lewis is a is an actor from brazil and he's building his career in he's based in barcelona and he's building his career in in in europe so at some point he was asking like uh how how you do or how yeah how you do up duplication process or how you're dealing with these things here and for what he showed me something like automatically you know what i what i thought i it was not working in terms of efficiency basically in terms of like give me money uh institution give me money select me because i need the money is that his performance he what he's doing was socially uh it has a message it does it was a performance so it has very strong message about i guess his context as brazilian and then right away basically i say something that it was not working because of that what i realized in practical terms what i realized during the conversation was that somehow i was and was like uh opening mind for me because it was that in some way in my path here in europe for 12 years i realized that i domesticated myself you know which is normal let's say like you can call it just you you you just get used to the the system how it works here but in the other way also i think i just domesticate myself in the sense of i know let's say in colombia or in brazil like most of the performance they have a heavy charge in political things because there are things that are happening so the people need to speak about these things uh but then when you put it like those things in the context here in european context in a way or in a way basically is i think people don't want to get confronted with these things it's not really it's not really the way it works things here you do it in a more sophisticated way or let's say you can try instead of like doing a political speech mean i will deconstruct the thing in a very high level uh approach to making art that was the way i was thinking when i said to him basically i thought like you can do the same but you have to deconstruct it more because otherwise basically white people in europe get uncomfortable with the message that you are saying and although in terms of effectiveness is true because i think you will have a better chance to get selected uh which is this is about in terms of efficiency and money and the other side is that is is what what the this means you know like what so it's this is effectiveness but the other one is like do you have to always let's say in in if you're in a wide wide context or in europe do you have always to domesticate yourself to not make feel uncomfortable the white person and and yeah and that's that's and that's the base of colonialism you know like when you speak when there are jokes in between i learned that i was in practice in safe space like empath when there are some jokes that normally you will joke about it i don't know say a racist jokes i remember a friend of mine at some point saying something about spanish spain or colon colonial something in a conversation in path and i remember that i laughed but i have the reflection to slow down and say wait now in this moment i can actually reflect and say this was not right and that's that gesture is when we actually just we perpetrate colonialism but it's just really deep in our system it's just difficult to catch uh because we we perpetuate the thing yeah i mean yeah um i don't know what how i can bring this to a constructive discussion um but that's why like i always say you know white male is toxic because i mean i think i i've said this a few times in the chat as well but just to you know to start with being being white being male or being white male is like already toxic and you cannot just say i think yeah we said something like this before but you cannot just you know do something good for others you know because i'm privileged to do something for others it's it's the worst thing that can be really toxic so i i think if someone's privileged we have to start from the standpoint that i am toxic actually and then from there what can i do you know we cannot just say that you know if you're black if you're you know people color you should do this way that way you should you know i mean but i mean not saying about your case because that's you know you're both from latin america and you know it's more about how they say no i think i think i agree with you like absolutely like when when is this was very clear at the beginning when we started doing this asymmetry thing i mean buffalo like the confrontat the realization of one's privilege because we all have privilege in different levels and then it's just if you are basically at some point you are ready to to to be accountable or basically to live part of your privilege because then you yeah in order to give a space for other ones to access that privilege in different ways i think i think that was a node uh caroline cinders she's her in her presentation she was saying that she she talks about feminism but she's white and she cannot talk about like black women for example and that's something that she really acknowledges and that's also you know you know and i say this like about white male but also i'm privileged as male 1 or playing privilege that i'm from japan obviously so um that always think about i mean but another thing i wanted to talk about your story uh with the the dancer from melting pot is waiting can you wait for a second i need to come back for a second so i have to do a solo again i guess um today i don't have my nails painted blue but i just have a little bit of glitter which is hard to focus it's kind of nice i i removed my nail polish this morning and then i kind of liked it like this but also a bit shy to go out without anything on my nails so it's a bit of tumble but it's actually actually um you can see it on the camera maybe because of the reflection it's supposed to be a bit blue but the one i bought in hong kong but it's a brand from japan but they say it's made in france which i kind of feel so funny and what it's called it's called nailholic i think the name sounds really funny and the one interesting thing about japanese or maybe asian in general the nail polish is their brush is like so thin like here what you get probably like with one stroke i can paint the whole nail but from the one in japan i have to do it like three times okay yes please yeah go back to you said there was some something else you want that story i think what's what's important um with let's say like writing an application is like the idea of sandbox because you don't want to write as yourself then that becomes really toxic to yourself like like you said um so i think i always try to do a bit like it's not like yeah it's a practice like when i write i write in the sandbox and not to mix up with my identity because that could that could kill yourself but then it's still like so i completely i understand but i think what is interesting i think from what what we are talking here is that he's not there is one thing of the other one you know is but it's just to have the reflection for instance in that conversation i just realized uh that i i'm just functioning what i said in my words is like i just get domesticated in a way like to not do things in certain way how i would have done it if i will still be in colombia i think what is what is interesting and i think that's my i'm very i'm curious of that since the last few months i guess maybe the last year is how can i still uh that's more of me like with things that happens in colombia or more basically i guess more i feel more comfortable with my own identities i think as mail the funds once or with all the things that comes with my identities is that still i think there should be space in what i'm doing too slowly i mean to just give space for basically a space to take me out of the sandbox slowly you know and then just try things out i remember for instance when we have at some point we were writing this with joanna chicago and then i i mentioned at some point the the i i felt that we should give it a little bit more of a space to speak from one's uh identities or like well yeah and then the idea was exactly uh not to hijack the this the space but just to give the space to have reflection of it and not just go in automatic mode to do what we know it should be done to get what we are searching in that case and a grant yeah i i that was really nice because if i write it's always the same tone that you know i know that i i'm good at writing grand applications i would say i mean um yeah let's say i'm good um but that also is because i don't it's not that i don't talk about myself but but yeah like i i adapted my writing style to what they want basically and that's not something that come from myself but you know it's gradually trying to i don't know but also like i think how i write fits well sometimes so it's not like completely like you know i force myself to write in a certain way that probably they will like it um but still that is true to a certain extent and it's nice and then i think what's more important is to explore different ways of writing because also that you know opens different collaborations and like with you you know it's at first it was for me it was really hard to write with you because um i don't know what's the common ground for us like where to start with how to write and but since that uh grant application which failed but i think it was really good exercise yeah yeah i think that this we have been through this exercise few times and we now more or less we know what is the style that the one and the other one will write and and kind of kind of uh but also we share like text for instance like yeah you saw also my magazine and stuff like so then we have shared these things we know more or less what is in we know what are we talking about like in in which boundaries are we we are still convening because basically we are just going in yeah we are circum being in the same topics but what i was thinking is what you were saying is in regards to vienna because we go to vienna to the impulse dance today is that what i found interesting in this conversation is that so that we say that more or less like we if we have 90 minutes that we would like to use maybe half an hour or something like that to talk in a way that we just said uh it's everything can change but that's what we just said um but then i was thinking in this idea of talking you know how seeing going back to what we were just saying or like how to keep a tone that gives space to to become odd at some time so like that say that for instance if you just try to speak in a way that people understand um and also i guess in a context like that speaking about identities or things like that are it will be more possible said because people are more used to like uh hearing things about yeah performative things uh which deal more with identities so in that space i guess people will be more prompt to hear these topics uh and less about i guess technological stuff you know um then what i'm thinking that might be interesting is like find a tone that is just flat but then sometimes for no reason it's just kind of a choreography for some for some reason it started explaining how hydra works you know something that it gets super complex for you know like if you're in a conference and somebody's speaking something that you understand and for some reason from nowhere that person started just going very in depth of something that you have no idea that like for i don't know say two minutes or just for a few seconds that in a way just make your brain thinking what what is just happening you know but but then it's just so it passes so fast that you don't really have the reflex to think about what it happened so i'm thinking basically that the chat could be interesting to have like a flat line something but in between we can start just basically hijacking the conversation for one minute two minutes and they come back to a flat line uh which i think makes more dynamic the conversation um i don't know if that it somehow it makes sense what i'm saying um i think i get the point now it's like this is a public chat so it's like a public brainstorming for the sessions but it's nice brainstorming and we'll have public rehearsal and whatever um i was thinking like should we like should we really talk from the top or should we do it like practice it um because i'm not good at explaining things no but you know actually it could be the what i was thinking right now it could be the other way our way we could be that we just do and then we talk i think that's what uh what i think that's more interesting that's more interesting than just talk and then do because like because the thing is if we talk like they're like people don't understand i mean not because there's no reference now absolutely no i think you're right uh yes i guess and also the other thing that i was thinking is because i think like let's say in and i have been thinking of that is that what might be actually interesting from a personal point of view and i think as a yeah is that is what what is your story with best practices you know what is my story with best practices is this a different one and i think that's when i think when i present my story in the school it makes a lot of sense because it was my view on that so basically that i started building an installation it didn't work because there was covered and at some time think at the same time i was already working with you i just realized shazam this is gonna be the final work it's gonna be best practices so and that was my story with the practice uh in that context and um so and somehow i think that could be interesting to to share a bit of like what is this what is the practice for what how was the practice how is the practice um maybe we should do this exercise maybe once we are together in vienna and maybe as a public chat basically yeah it could be it could be definitely a good way to share this thing and time it you know like are we talking for two hours oh not working we can do it for six hours no um but i told you like in in one of the seminars i did was just show the video a show real that this is long and then after that i collected questions and then i started like building story from the questions and it kind of worked well also like i i think i liked when i was not like answering like from one question to you know another but i mean like like a conversation but i collected questions at first because then you know it gives time to digest there's questions to digest there's not much something that you know it's like running and running if you just answer to one question to another then but then if you collect them and then let it sit and ferment and then we can start talking about something and then if they come up with other questions they can talk about it again um but we can you know explore with different yeah yeah but this is you're saying it's interesting because like this is the then you're bringing things like there are new uh into what i was thinking what to do and one thing there is for sure and then i actually that experience when i did my presentation was the the the you need time to digest this thing um and it's so dense man i mean for us we are doing this for one year so it's just fun to do right yeah yeah but there's here's what it is you just go like yeah something will happen it will be cool it will be fine if we fail it will be fine one hour that's it yeah yeah goodbye and see you next time bye bye enjoy thank you thank you stick here hashtag and people are just what the just happened so but no i think that as part of that i think could be interesting to take this as i see it as a choreography in the sense of like this and understanding as a structuring something uh not with hard things but just like understanding one of the elements for sure is that this pause i think and understanding also what i think is cool of the public that i didn't have when i did my presentation is that it is that it's a people it's people who come from dancefield uh so that that's something that might be interesting to explore you know like maybe show something say we are doing a practice but maybe we just stop it for a second and then we just give some space for just a stop and then just keep on doing i just acknowledging that there is embodiment embodiment to be processed yeah it's gonna be fun for sure but i mean like i think as a whole thing like we can just think about it as a practice not like strict timed strictly planned thing but we just make a sandbox for this thing and then we'll see and then and that's what i define but that's what i call that is close to the idea of the choreographic thing with the element basically what are the elements that we are going to take that into account i'm going crazy trying to imagine how the are we going to deal with the because with naoto we are used to working in distance and now we're gonna be in in the stage i open up now we're gonna be in the same space so i'm in my head i'm going bunkers thinking like how are we gonna do this how how we're gonna what is going to happen [Music] um because i have like i just have the the memory of hearing daniel or seeing daniel and lisa when they were because they work in the distances and i think what they were trying to work together on the stage it just didn't work yeah they did like residency and ended up working in the separate rooms like performing in separate rooms and i just and that just silly you know like that's just that's just strange oh that's an option right but yeah that's an option that's always absolutely that's an option but i think we should try to like go to the arsenal or go or in or some places and start just maybe trying to do a practice where you are when you where you are in the space you like i think an example of that we did that and notes at the end of the performance because we were just crazy and things were not working i don't know then we just started jumping and then i we were separated by a but some ball and then at some point we just started running to now it's computer oh now it was going to my computer and then we just we were just doing that i think somehow um yeah something where the the this we never were confronting somebody was asking me this when i was sharing the the format with some of the andres friends and it was very uh the person was asking so what is the space you know like and for me it's usually at the space it's just a green key or some other function to give this possibility to blend your image on my background and that space voila but the thing is if you are there it's not so easy because like then i have to or once it's like i deny that you are in my space you know then it's just like the same that i'm here and then i just decided with somehow i will put it in my background or even somehow i just acknowledge that you are in the same space we we we haven't deal with this thing of the of the space right we'll see we actually we also we can just start from that we we can just share absolutely it's not that we are supposed to do our performance this is not the project is not intended to have one performance and the project itself is a practice itself you exactly it's one of the first ones i wrote i think like the one of the you know like main description i think like with the thing that works always the best for me that is when i when i share this because i use some of these words then it's that for me it's very clear the idea like the practice is a clear conversation between technologies and bodies and but i always so that's because that sentence and then i was explaining to a friend like the idea of that is a queer thing is because it's not dance at the service of technology so say it is like when i was doing my first semester uh using the kinect on notch so just using the dance on the surface of the 3d space because it's cool and is not technology on dance piece to make uh so it's not video mapping of the dance piece to make the dance look cooler which is in that sense it is functional or for technology or for dance but that's why that's why it's queer it's something that it cannot be one only thing but and it stays constantly jumping between one thing and the other one okay what is it is something that is in between is something that actually it's it's in between or something else i guess in impractical terms will be in between but i guess i would like to see it i think it's something else that's that's the way why defining that is like the way how i how i said that this is in in a problem is that i assumed that there was prob the problem of the virtualization of the dance and then because of the dance as and the embodied experience suffer from being classes classes and performances becoming soon calls through videos then the dance suffer because of the medium in this case the video so in this case the medium becomes a problem so the video becomes a problem while you try when you try to put dance or classes through video so the medium is the problem itself so in and in that way how i present the my solution on my approach to propose something was to blend the digital platforms technology and body to propose a new medium uh and i call it a new art medium uh because then i see and then for me the the simple way is to see it that is a new way to like a new epi like a new epistemic understanding of the body in relation to the video so still the channel in the ways the video to make it simple because my problem is the video the video is the problem uh but then you can go more you can go more in depth and say like yeah but maybe is the internet maybe it's the maybe it's the web the way i put it in simple terms it's just the video because at the end is from what i see is that it's something that it will be recorded and at some point it will be stream so that's a different topic but at the core is body record somehow and so a dennis then i said is a new art medium not only a medium but it's an art medium that is not dance and it's not video is something in between but it's still so then it's a new thing it's something in between dance and video and it becomes something new and uh yeah yeah yeah that's really nice and it's not from my writing um no no um i was i was thinking like i was watching um performance from floor i think well she i think they recorded uh before and then they showed it i think yesterday i don't know um so it's like a you know life coding performance like she does like go with the computer and the partner is doing the you know the sound stuff with um controllers and pads and whatever like electronic stuff what was interesting to me was the camera it's so dominant i i don't know if it's because of the practices i do or it's because of how it was framed but you know like someone's holding a camera and um showing the you know electronics or computer or the keyboard or whatever and then sometimes the cut changes to you know the frontal or from the side but that was so dominant and i would say it would be more interesting if they could control it because i didn't have a feeling that i was watching a performance it's a recording of the of the performance itself yeah it's a recording of the performance but because i don't know how they edited it but the camera was so strong i mean also the visual was kind of um let's say ambient it's not like changing like yeah so is this thing that was it was more like blue yeah yeah i saw it and i answered something to her i think that was very cool i thought that was very nice i said to her that i thought because it's more yeah we talked about this in the past that it was something there is there is not so many changes so you can follow actually in a mesmerizing way sorry yeah but so you were saying that that's why like i thought like i'm just like like visually it's about where i'm watching not about the content of the performance so as a totality yeah yeah i yeah because there is something that i think i have this feeling with the live coding graves or live performances live coding how it's called live coding algorithm like yeah yeah what what i don't like is or what i feel i don't like no i would say like i feel uncomfortable with it is that is the showcasing of still somebody uh in front and there is of this very is part of the is part of the stage that in a way it seems it seems that is not very flexible it's just this there is people on the stage and there's the visuals happening so then it's basically let's say the format is very straightforward so over and over more or less is the same somebody goes in front and and let's say the stages sound would be very similar if you want to say it's not correct yeah but then but then i think that will be though maybe i guess that has a reason why it was like that at some point but i think in order to become something else then i think the the the person the human has to become [Music] best strong somehow because it as an audience i don't know like i feel as if i'm seeing that or just in the video i see there's a lot of focus there's a lot of mesmerizing in what they do with the computer you know that how how cool can how can they do this you know um so yeah there is there is something where like the human is not so human somehow it's not that i expect me yeah it's not it's not that i'm expecting them to dance or something but i guess there is a missing some motion or yeah it's like a instrument instrumented or well not even i mean it's boring like i i like i i hate those like code performances um from the beginning like when i started watching those like you know and it's just it's just boring because i mean you cannot change a lot with a code that's one thing and then also if the person is you know just coding then it's you know what am i supposed to watch i watch their hands if they have nails painted that's interesting but then you know what what is it really like i mean it's it's so funny that as a medium like as a concept i think it's super interesting because you're changing something with the code which is like i i like that idea but as a how it's framed in a performance like you know who's going to watch it i'm sorry if you're if you're a life coder i'm very sorry but i have to say it's so boring oh like what yeah the way how i feel from that is that yeah i i think is i think it's very similar like when you say like analogy when somebody's playing classical music the difference is that with classical music then we are because then it's just at some you get yeah you get something more excited or less excited so i guess it happens something similar with the with the computer as instrument um but i don't know i think it's just like there is there is a the dehumanization there in a way yeah i basically what you said like would be nice if at some point maybe just they painted their nails or if anything whatever something that it just refreshes the the thing that it makes the experience more human this actually reminds me i think i never told this story but three years ago i did residency in korea and at the end we did like a performance at the open house and i was working with a dj but like she she's she makes sound and i was making visuals with processing by the way processing um and what did i want to say oh yeah so i made like really complex um like timeline and visuals just with the code uh but not not like light coding but i was like controlling the midi controller and i don't know like it's i think it's like 20 minutes and like doing something for 20 minutes with code is so hard um but i managed to do it um first part was like geometric things you know like lines and stuff and i was so you know confident with what i'm doing but i think the most of like it was like open studio and like most of the audience is not like artists but they're like local people just you know coming to like a festival thing and at the time like i had like half of the performance uh with with the camera and i was showing my face and doing some you know face morphing like face tracking and like morphing and stuff like that and as soon as i showed my face on the big screen like people just started like laughing and that was that was the best moment i was like you know i coded like hours and hours preparing this frosting whatever that no one appreciates and as soon as i show my face that's like the the best moment like you know yeah this but i think that that was really good that i it happened because now i i know that you know i just show myself and that's that's the interesting thing yeah yeah yeah exactly because that's what what i mentioned what i was mentioning like the dehumanization of the thing like even let's say if the performance in any way presents something that it has the magic of code of this kind of thing and this feeling that is that's cool whatever but if the people cannot relate to the work it's just like masturbation somehow i mean it's alone so i think that's what it's like super good example like you put the face people have face and then i just i mean there is not too much to think there is empathy happening there right away no yeah yeah yeah yeah so yeah i mean that's a that's a good lesson let's do it so in the impulse down we're going to do a live coding rave this is quite yeah yeah which is why we go there put some headphones at last one minute like we show ourselves let's start dancing yes i take my leggings with me and my rebooks great um yeah should we close some something around here i don't know yeah i don't know wait let's close here and then we speak about practical stuff okay okay so whatever whatever please whatever father and see you in vienna and see you in vienna and they will be so cool because there are these social events i will be so looking forward for dancing go dancing dancing so", "zDiNIxvz5pw": "okay hello hello everyone hello just like we just met yeah we just met is this is this triggering and all a different self when we speak like this in the chat when we know it's gonna be public is this not the same now also that we were just i was talking before oh there's no no to before anyways no um for the people yeah i know um that's a good question i mean but it's you know in in our lives like constantly we shift different personas right like personal our personality because you know it's not always you talk with talk with friends but talk with some sometimes you know more like rather formal context so i mean right now we cannot you know talk about uh i don't know something bad about other people i mean we can but now i cannot complain and say names about people who are not paying me enough to do my work but this is actually like i was thinking like um so we go to vienna right uh in already like two weeks so three weeks man this is really happening i was thinking that already like because i feel i just finished this like big uh work sessions for three months and now i'm thinking like okay i can't rest but to be honest like we we have to be in vienna we said we will be in vienna the 26th of july and today's july and and then before i have to go to rome and and arrange other things because then after also i will go to liens and so i have to arrange things before i go things and when when are you going to to leave austria i didn't two weeks so yeah so you're leaving also so two weeks is when you travel there like 20 so i leave on 19th to lynch and one night there and from the next following day i'll be in mountains and then uh on 25th i should be in vienna right if you want to follow us gonna be fun it's gonna be fun to do chats from different places this is something so the reason why i said it about this vienna is uh you know at impro stands there's always performances so what if we just do a chat every time like we watch performance and then we talk about that performance in the chat i don't know what's it against it again i didn't i didn't understand so we go to improve students and you know there's like performances like every day everywhere so we just like watch performances and talk about it and uh in the chat most likely we just talk about performance yeah this was really bad bad this was not good at all but this is fun i mean you know like this make me think in this thing that uh i saw yesterday from alan plateau in the coast you know standing this festival um [Music] and then it was so good because also it was not super good i don't know how to say it was i mean it was just the the the the piece itself gives space to to criticize to enjoy uh it has a lot of um agency yes yes yes yes yes absolutely as an audience you you feel uh agent to go for whatever you want to go true yeah because this is like the the tricky part of the you know like perfecting something that you can only go worse than the perfection yep you cannot exceed that you know well i mean some people would receive something more than perfection i don't know but you know you just spot all these you know there was a mistake there was this lighting was this bad this is you know we can you can talk about these things but that just doesn't make it interesting right if something is you know i don't know like if if that performance was bad in a sense that like i don't know what sense that you would say bad but if it's bad in a good sense then yeah we can just talk about or you know at least you know you just say you know i would have done this way or i would have done that way which is not a fun uh it's not a constructive discussion but it's at least you know make conversation going uh i don't know yeah yeah you know i think that also something i was thinking this week was that because we are used to now these formats like so digital and this is something that i feel very comfortable between like dancing digitally then i was like more in a classical dance contemporary dance setup so people dancing on the stage and one of the things that i was really not comfortable with was performances uh in the sense of close to visual art performance like uh so dealing a lot with identities and people who really have something to say in certain way could be because my position is is in this way right now like where i don't feel so comfortable with a message basically these days then i was very i was easily irritated fast when somebody started just just saying something um it felt pathetic to me i was very very i was very drastic because the thing is i was in my room i was facing the stage from my room so i could just basically from there more or less following up and then even though what i was not like following i could hear sometimes i don't know people speaking about stories or doing them performances more than the dancing itself when there was dancing i guess the only thing that does the thing with performances you cannot because they use cognition like or wording but you when you use words and out loud it's difficult to ignore somebody telling you something is very strong you know if it's difficult to ignore somebody speaking about immigration or somebody dying in the sea you know it's it's not the same while it's easier to you can avoid uh people if you see people dancing in a way they can catch your attention but you easily can just let it go because it's not really sinking too much on you um yeah you have to kind of actively extract something from it i think i think one of the texts that we saw the one that from the book of daniel i think from what daniel wrote i think he used to say that we talk about the daniel uh blanga goodbye which is the director of uh the constant festival in brussels and we talked at some point about his text which was called here and it was called the movement as a living body and he was basically using at some point he was saying that at some point he was falling in love with certain uh uh characters like he in the text he was saying sometimes that that he sometimes forget about himself because basically he fall in love of this dancer or this one or something like this and yeah i was thinking that in in the process of how i experienced the dance that i saw yesterday and the last time i saw something that was not melting pot um [Music] it was long time ago i didn't see a piece in reality it was quite was long i cannot even remember when was long time ago and and so this one was very nice because it allowed me to do whatever i wanted to criticize to just go to one one of the dancers to [Music] uh yeah give back agency to me and then i could enjoy the the dance yeah i that reminds me of this um choreographer once we are in uh it wasn't a panel but like a short presentations and she was basically talking about her piece with um like using projection mapping to basically make shadows to animate so it's not you know like you cannot project shadows but you can just project like white color with a cut out like silhouette of the body that becomes a shadow and it's not just like on the on the backdrop but everywhere on the stage so it really looks like someone's walking around but it's it's just shadow it's just video anyways but that part i i don't know it's kind of to me it's a bit too technical and i don't know if that's interesting to me but what's the inspiration of the piece was that she was saying that if she's got bored watching a dance piece then she just started like watching the shadows on the stage and that was the inspiration and that that was really like something yeah like that part i really liked it because it's basically like hacking into a performance or artwork that to see something that in a way that it's not supposed to be yeah yeah yeah but you find something interesting sometimes i do it also with art pieces like when i really get bored with the exhibition for example i just like look at the the labels like the captions and see what's interesting there or what points they are using um yeah but i think like this is because then we speak about this is mistakes right i mean their things are not planned and i think time it it has a huge importance in those mistakes were happening i i was having this conversation with uh the dj of melting pot and he was saying that he and his wife they do also artificial compositions but they don't really think too much in what they're doing but they do a lot and then they should let it rest for a while and then they just come back and then in that way they found interesting things uh and that's just on the idea if you keep on doing something that you think is good and then you try to keep on perfecting you won't have the space to let the things uh sink in your head and have a different vision of that yeah but that that's also like kind of goes back to the idea of the medium like what is what what do you really want to play with is it actually the form of let's say you know the visual or the visual thing like you really want to make some kind of form that you imagine or you actually play with the medium like what is it to like project something on the wall or what is it to show something on the led display or whatever and the if you play with the medium then that works because you step back and look it as a [Music] media not just as a content or the performance of the shadow not as the content of what's happening on the stage but i think that's the beauty like that you have with dance is that you everybody has a body everybody moves and then yeah everybody relates to that everybody dance you know everybody dance but not everybody plays a music but everybody can enjoy the music right and so you have this [Music] thing that is abstract and everybody can enjoy and problem becomes when you when the tools appear in a way and because the tools are there to make some function so to make it better the dance or something and then always there is a problem how much do i need to use a tool what is the line in between things to be perfect or not and then going back to the performance i think what what was working is that they were dancing on the beach right so they have the sand and so you see them struggle struggling but in a in a natural way each one was dealing a different way with their limitation as dancers in the beach and during following the chorus of their movements they were each of them in different ways they were not making it perfect and i think i don't know if that was it consciously but it was very clear that each of them they have different difficulties and they were dealing differently with the tiredness and the sand and with the rain and the whole thing and that's why it make the pieces stand out because you can actually feel each individual within a group of 14 dancers and that was very interesting yeah i mean i cannot really speak for um how they say like more classical type dance but that is the problem right because i like as a dancer you have to in a way you have to become something empty if you want to become something perfect you cannot manifest anything in a way because you just you have to perfect the movement for example or whatever technique that's different from how your body works it's not natural i don't know yeah because we don't yeah okay that's the problem like that i was dealing with like dance at some point is if you if when you are improvising you're just supposed actually to let the dance go through you um i think at the beginning when you're just dancing more for intuition with intuition then it's more the joy of dance but at some point then you start having putting things on top so putting the technique and then when you go back to the improvisation you start very fast doing this uh you start criticizing yourself so you start composing is what we do in a practice and and then trying to hold too much to an ideal so you're dealing with your wishes and desires come constantly uh how i would like to see myself and this we talked like a few months ago or maybe even before like last year like about the flow like how we get into the flow and you know this kind of ideas like how i look like how do i want to look like this basically blocks the flow and you won't really get there and is it because of experience or is it something else i think that's something we talked yeah before but and i think has to be also with the this idea of because yeah this idea of uh just let it go and not staying on the thing like because you cannot avoid being naoto uh and trying to yeah you cannot avoid being yourself but then the the difference is let's say in a practice is like how long you have to hold to an idea to let it pass through you fast and to just adjust and i think in that regard i think we are locking the sense of doing this by two because then you have you don't have too much time for reflect because there is another part who is doing something so you have to really fast to adjust and just go with yeah yeah like i think last month or maybe two months ago i was i did a few times like practice by myself but it was really it's just hard you know like probably like related to what you just said but i can't do it longer than like let's say 30 minutes because it's just so intense and you just you know constantly like aware of what you're doing and there's like if we do it together for example i can just you know show you on my screen and that's already something but i can kind of rest not rest rest but you know i can step backward to reflection or just show myself that's okay because you are doing something so it's constantly something's happening but if i'm alone then it's more about you know like the composition i have to think about because there's nothing i can rely on [Music] yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah it's not fun that's that's the whole thing like i tried a few times and it's like it's just not fun to do it because should exactly because it should be fun like that's the way why relate like with dance at some point it was not fun anymore so if you lose the thing that it brings you to that weird space that not too many people do then it's just if you lose the fun there is no point of doing that right yeah yeah then i think like also like i did like one hour of uh that was let's say that was a performance like last year alone in one of those you know conferences and that was like i managed to do it and i think that was kind of that kind of worked because there was a chat that people are like you know talking about something and i could sometimes reply to them so it was not like completely alone and there's you know some response from people even if it's not like a huge traffic you know once a while someone writes it's good it's bad whatever um but if i'm really like alone in a close it and do a practice for one hour that's uh that's really not fun i i wouldn't think about it anymore even to try it [Music] right but in that sense i think the workshop idea would work well because it's it's not like closing to one person or ourselves but it's you know supposed to open it to more people i don't know i don't know how how it works no that's absolutely something that we did that we're aiming now and that's very exciting like how to share the framework right like the how to share the sandbox and that's something that uh yes we're looking forward um but maybe we should go close here because that's also gonna be almost two and then maybe we should do a practice tomorrow or something like this but now you can just close here and then we just go back to the backstage yeah so thank you for watching uh you're coming to the impulse dance yes let's meet in vienna i mean if you're coming if you're in vienna or if you're coming to the symposium drop us a line somehow and we'll we'll invite you i don't know whatever yes so please like the video and what is it subscribe to the channel thank you bye", "AgmqO_eD9cc": "okay in progress what up sorry man i'm gonna be distract between yeah yeah it's okay hey i was doing some coding but uh yeah i got i got my my grades yesterday of the final work and i got 19 out of 20. it was almost perfect oh wow that's great it's like the best it's the best official is the best score in the school in the open all right so congratulations to you too as a mentor [Music] as a mentor and the framework we both developed i was afraid that the people would not understand that because the school was it's a technical school so i was afraid yeah so but when i finished i i felt that okay it was fine you know i didn't have really big conflicts with people trying to understand the framework but it was very surprising that it was like almost perfect score that's great and what like you're like officially done or like do you still i need to do the my internship is still huh that's the only thing i said oh i see yeah yeah because i think that the only thing i need but let's say i'm done with the classes and these kind of things that the classes right so very happy about it but yeah at the same time i have i said melting pot for this week and since the coast placement standing which is really close to bruce and they were in rehearsing in bridge and it's raining the performance is gonna be outside so it's a huge we don't know because if it rains we cannot do it but nevertheless we have to prepare so i have to go i have to be between sandy and brooch the last two days went back and forth but it's like i mean it's like two hours right from brussels it's at the coast and i don't want to be in bridge anymore i have been way too much in british i don't want to see that city anymore and i have to keep on coming back so i'm really dumb with brooch for a while but yeah yeah because the the seas is uh is it done or like what see this is basically what happened now so it was officially the opening last friday it's like a big was like a big stop i didn't know it was like that that apparently yeah in a way they use it as flag gnome that's as a flag like the major was there you know like a big thing for the city like they promote multiple multi-disciplinarity i mean that they were really open-minded like they're really the the mayor and all these bureaucrat bureaucrats they basically use the project to because the project is functional it's easy for politicians to go and support it because for what people see from outside it's just a massive installation that looks super good and it has plans i'm in a video game so it looks like super futuristic and it's massive so it's very functional in that sense for a politician but in ecological terms uh from like from from a political stand point of view it's just yeah it's just it's so it's so much because i'm sure like the mayor has no idea and somebody grows you know when he was there in the opening what he was supposed to say like i mean nobody if if i don't really understand fully how those unders everything works so the mayor yeah it just is in a way felt like it is the fake of the fake of the fakes it's very strange because i i really learned a lot with the process and i really like the the seed collective but at the same time it was very clear at some point that angelo and myself we have a very different approach to art which art angelou's collective and when mine is in a way more solo or you know like more thinking in frame like you know the position of artists so it was cool and we have on tuesday like i'm an internal meeting um but it feels almost like i think that collective has to move in in some direction because there were many weird things like we draw a lot of pla i mean that's what i'm saying like from what people see from outside basically this idea of recycling e-waste using plants blah blah blah all this thing that it sounds very good and at the end the object is very cool but what people don't see is that because we were supported with big budgets from the government we just bought a lot of plans we throw plans and we don't work all these kind of things of course yeah yeah it's not in that garage that you're trying to put things together and somehow make it work i think i i think the problem with the project is the scope because i think this is the version of number 31 so i think originally let's say back 12 years ago as a project that it really you know a small project with a small crew doing this stuff it will be honest in what it's doing but now there is 12 years after with all that budget is just not honest of how it's happening it's corruption during time i guess it's also um you need to balance or i mean yeah like you may have to make compromise right like if you want to make it bigger or try to keep the original how to say honest approach to it but i think that's part of what we're going to talk a thing on tuesday because i think it's nobody's fault but anyway there was a compromise before it's starting that it should be a bio mode in a space that's 80 square meters so it's a massive space so the installation has to go reaching high as  so at the end installation was massive um i don't know if i send you a link but i will send you some pictures but i think i had i sent you some things it looks very cool and does it just i let's say 20 of less than twenty percent of what we work with in one year it was implemented uh it was a very interesting process but say in a way if i will think more from a design point of view or strategically it was just so not really planning just kind of last minute finishing everything you know what i mean like okay this is not working no no no no no no make it look good voila taping did he be conceptually you know not as a surface yeah but absolutely yeah it was i think it worked in boats and like taping but also not too much because there were cables hanging all over the place so do all this cable management it doesn't work completely if you try to make it clean because first you cannot clean it second like uh also you cannot leave it all like as a mess because it's way too much so you need to find a balance aesthetically that you feel that is messy but it still is not so messy so it's kind of this idea i think it's close to martin when he says like the difference between a justified image and just an image so that just an image still needs to be interesting enough to not be anything but the people need to understand is an organized mess somehow yeah that's what i want to say exactly yeah but how are you doing how was your experience like with your poster their back well this is also like an organized mess right it's uh it's it's quite like you know random in as an image like with a but then you work with three colors no it's just two two yeah and then you know they overlap and mix the colors and then ends up with something like this but then but then how it works if you put two colors so you put red and blue right yeah like pink and then so you you you are not choosing with the machine how to mix the colors but depending of the art you basically like print twice so you uh i don't know if i have it right um like it's it's really animal so like there's a finished one but there's yeah this one that i didn't print the blue layer so you end up like this and then you have to see it again you have to pass the same paper two times yeah but because uh how it works is you know not like a inkjet print but it makes the master like a sheet of ink that you know they burn the pattern on it and then they will feed the paper again and again again with the same master is this kind of thing that you have some like like a wooden plate with some um yeah i don't remember how it's called and then at the end basically you do this yeah no i mean it's it's different but uh i mean physically it's it's very different but i think the concept is the same it should be similar yeah but i guess like for more fast printing somehow right it's like literally you know like it just passed through the paper and that's it that's already printed but is it still analog there is nothing digital in that no it's it has a digital uh process to get the data and print it on the master but other than that like once the master is done it's it's all um i mean it's controlled machine but it uh the process is animal so i'm trying to go there again next week and try to experiment a little bit more maybe not the practice it's hard to find like a you know the image that works like this one is really cool because it was like already like two colors so it was easy to process but i tried to find like other uh images from the practice but didn't really end up interesting maybe i should just try i don't know yeah i understand because i think i think my girlfriend when she studied she started graphic design in a technical school and her work she was doing printing with plants and then so she was taking basically the plant shapes and she was yeah that's what she was doing she was scanning to get the patterns of the plants and then she was doing different set of prints so she was basically offsetting the the mold that she got with different colors okay so it was a very sim said it's just a a leaf and then she got them all from so i scanned the mold that it gives already this analog texture and then from there she will start printing in yellow and then she will offset it a little bit and then naturally some things will happen but in it it was a very simple uh canvas so the thing they did yeah yeah the first thing that yeah yeah was a very simple canvas okay because many of the things that we do is about super glitch you know so yeah i mean for me whatever uh image works you know you just have to output a grayscale image and then it it just works but uh so you have to prepare like several images if you want to work with different colors and you have to think about how they overlap um yeah i'm i'm thinking about more like geometric patterns but let's see yeah i was thinking yeah yeah i was thinking i just thought already like kind of like yeah just like like a triangle feedback triangle just analog to manual it would be easier to kind of like understand i think at the beginning what are you doing uh then you then you can do but at the same time you know for practical reasons i think that's a super cool poster the one that you have behind yeah thanks so it it really works something that works as a poster you know yeah why not you know what will be funny it's just you put it like we sell best practices you know when people are selling things in their house and then just make i don't know or we fix shoes or we sell ice creams or things like that in in their apartments you put it at the at your living room like selling best practices best prices the best practices for sale that's good let's practice this for sale hmm uh okay what should we talk about what should we oh yeah we have the practical things we have practically the other thing is that uh before going there like at the school they are asking uh hello hi now as you know hi farah hello thank you friend of mine that she already knows you because somebody from the school so you are very famous in my school you are you're like you are like uh satoshi from bitcoin i mean maybe people don't really believe that you are real and then it's just a myth yeah we met when this happens and of course in the practice you could be something that it might be to you but yeah the other other thing is at the school they are asking for students to submit works to show it in the in the city as a principal what would at the school like they have uh like advertising like posters in the city like the one that you were selected the last year with your hand thing or not like something similar but that was for the seminar but uh as a school because the you know like the open campus things happening but kind of reduced scale um because obviously so they're like i think they got some spots in the city so i submitted um just like a screenshot of my youtube i thought about like just the youtube just your to youtube or like some of the playlists or just the youtuber this youtube channel of like my channel i thought at first i thought about doing this with the best practices like one of them but then i was like it's hard to choose one so why not just like just include everything as a video emails then you know people would see it i mean i don't know if it will be it will be selected or not but it will be funny if it's like princess at a poster and people see my channel as a poster but i think i think what i found that is cool in that idea is that that's that you're challenging the medium there and i think that's cool because because i mean in a way so yeah you're not doing a poster poster you know like you're putting another medium in the poster you're putting a youtube channel there and that's cool i mean i think that's that's that's it's already we don't we haven't speak like very often but uh i think this idea of the medium itself um is something that is getting more yeah it's cool it's cool when we when i speak with you i also might do and also reflect a lot i think when in what we in i think what we succeed with the best practices it was that without actually trying to reach we create a technology so it's kind of like super revolutionary and i said in my conclusion at some point that you might not like this practice or this one or whatever because i don't know i do something wrong you do something wrong the latency of whatever but just at the framework so it's as crea is revolutionary because there is the creation of a technology that possibility things to be um and i think in the in the framework itself what we do i think uh is we challenge the medium uh yeah and you uh end up saying that because you're saying it's just i'm saying that it's just cool because he without all this thinking i mean or it's just you stating that in a really loose way you know like hey by the way somebody asked me to do a poster so i just make a screenshot and put it there so all this that i'm saying that is like kind of like really conceptual it seems there is like a practice exercise that it comes natural to you and i found that super good yeah that you don't have to think about it yeah and it's also like it's not something that is like it is low-key like i just take a screenshot and maybe like adjust a little bit of you know like shading and stuff but but it's it's also not something that i it took like 10 seconds to do it but it is actually a collection of like actual content inside so it's like you know not that i just took inspiration from i mean i did take inspiration from this artist that they're famous for um printing uh google uh top page like really old one um like maybe what do you mean so their work as an artist uh one of the work is the print of a huge print of google top page like from like 2001 or two like you know like the top page that has a logo and there's like the text area and you have the you know search and feeling lucky you mean like a landing a landing page one image yeah they just printed that that's okay it's like i mean they're quite interesting i mean um i it feels you know they are like a bit like a high art kind of feeling that i don't like but or even high art like like they they you know like make things that collectors would like yes i sent you the their portfolio the website um but then like i didn't like you know i mean how to say it i didn't think about using that kind of approach but now i feel more comfortable to do it because i have like content within the best prices that we have there's a lot of content yeah yeah and we can just you know feed it to something else and i don't really feel bad or feel weird about doing like taking a screenshot of my youtube because that already reflects it's really rich yeah yeah yeah yeah i think it's cool i think it's really cool because in a way then we should record this i think we should record i mean we should speak out we should i think in the public one in the public one but no maybe just you can code it because at some point we just start speaking of this maybe we will see i don't edit chat um because i think what is cool is that it's because there is content i mean it's just it's what it seems to me there is school is just without thinking there are concepts that come i mean i'm sorry but i just have all this hashtag this thing from my final work so the concept is very prominent in my head almost a memory because i do the presentation and it just seems so cool because in a loose conversation just you confirm me that we are in the exercise of this is basically the medium is the message you know like it's just that not the not really worry about the content but because the content is there just actually you're more interested in how to portray it within a medium not worrying about how good or bad would look like you know so in a way then you bypass the politic part of like oh my god it might be am i going to be like it or not because in a way we are far from there already we are doing that for one year then you have all the symbols say the youtube channel with all the playlists they're also they're also is i think it works also because you have because we have this uh in a way materialized things so one could be completely in a topic place where just you don't care and yeah maybe that's also valid but if you know where you can you you have let's say in our case there is the playlist there is a content there is different versions of that then there is the chat in a way we can have uh i think we earned the space to say you know what i just used it you know this is just that you this is just the playlist you don't even have to promote the content you know you don't have to even go to the user to say like look to that one because that is a good one but it's more almost as a teaser without really trying to teach people is more like this is what we do and still experiment through the medium that's that's interesting like you said about martin um like again uh just an image but that's like it sounds easy but it's very difficult to get there like you know like because we did it we did this for like one year and now we can say that uh like in a way we don't care how it looks like we don't care yeah that's the feeling that i got like i don't care and also like i think it's not just for ourselves but for the viewers like well i don't know maybe they would expect something different but but we could you know we can somehow convince or at least we can say that it's just like you know just this is something it's some thing and it's not like we're trying to manifest something within this practice or you know like uh yeah but that's that's in a way it sounds so easy that we are like really sloppy and weird just throwing whatever but at the same time it's it's hard you know like it has been a long it's a long process it's true like maybe for people who are watching it that this has been long hard work don't worry this is the long hard work in a fun way that's really fun but it would have been working for one year you know believing in this but actually like sometimes i i well i look at your uh you know collection of images like you have one in your portfolio or we collect them in the in your folder but i actually like the one of the early ones that um like i'm like kind of standing there and you know uh jorge is like like triple jorge is in like overlaid somehow in the background do you remember that one i don't know which one it's like a blue color i think um i'll try to find it this this is like something that uh also like when i search for i don't know maybe my name it always comes up uh i'm opening it no and it looks like it will be interesting to see like we should do we should do one of the one of the chat sessions to go like i like this one because i think i like this like kind of like a guy through the archiving practice uh how can i do this this one like um which one was it so there are like newer ones and then there's the church i like a lot the the ones that you are like godzilla i mean that you are like in the projected in the you look like godzilla there like in the projection mapping on the church yeah it's this one i meant i i know yeah this one's like one of the old ones and like it it looks kind of bad but but it's it's i really really like it now like it's yeah i know i know what i mean i use it in my in my magazine yeah i just it says yeah i like it because it says a lot no like and it's quite simple also to follow yeah yeah because there's so many layers right like i remember in the presentation at some point i so i so i showed you the last show real no i think i didn't shoot with the last the last one did i show you one where i put in between like floors saying something about post-human i don't think so i think no i don't think so at the end i put something in between the floor was saying that and one of the things that i heard from the the jury one of the first things the first though they asked was like do you still talk with daniel chiffon and olivia because that was one of the conclusion is like i reached my target group and i took the screenshot of that shot when daniel and and then olivia were there so the one of the first question was like wow did you still like you know what from this wow did you still talk with them it was very funny [Music] yeah and famous people it's yeah it's also helps right you know like um whatever they don't understand or they understand then we say you know dan shifema was there and then people would if they're interested in coding like this that you know it's like instant it has to be yeah it has to be so some of the conclusions that i got from my work also is that like one trying to quantify also the conclusion it was that this is mega niche you know there's a super niche there's like there's there is i even i found there is a new term i didn't know it's called micro niche what we do is super it's up there is a micronesian but we do uh but it but it's uh but it's successful you know like the people that we reach they are interested in that and that's that's yeah that's clear but it's a micronage so that's interesting it's so funny that the name is best practices in contemporary dance and the end up micro dash project yeah it sounds like you know it's like something to talk to everyone in the contemporary house there's so much contradiction in that yeah i mean contemporary dance itself is maybe micro or nano niche so yeah i think we're gonna keep keep this as public chat i don't know maybe we cut the first part because we talked is do we talk about something bad i don't know i i i said something bad oh do we say something bad about daniel hopefully oh no naoto is real he's not a bot if somebody's watching he's not that bored he's real satoshi of bitcoin i do sometimes pretend like uh not a bot but uh like some seminars i just you know don't show my videos and i just type in a chat but i'm very active in the chat so it looks like a pot you know just [Music] yeah yeah yeah okay but let's talk about something more we need to talk about serious things so we go to backstage yeah we got this i guess so i don't know where we started but thanks for watching for watching and if you want to buy those uh just contact me we should start like printing math print shop best practices and printing so yes uh what is it i like i haven't like you know published anything big but on the youtube but i see like slowly people subscribe and that kind of satisfies me so thank you for subscribing it's very nice to see the growing of the channel", "c6gDV0zb0vw": "okay so i think we haven't tried this format before i don't know what in the background noise no there is some some music in the background oh that's why it's funny like i think zoom try to you know filter it oh so you have some feedback with the music it's not the feedback but it's like my own reverberation here the the bass or the hi-hat anyways i hear a little bit but not entirely but you hear me you hear me well it's okay i mean it's i hear you know other people talking so let's see at first it was really bad but now it's sort of better but this is good because like we we have we haven't tried this format before so i think this could be this should be a public one yeah well the thing is i had i had a vaccine today and i feel really  now yeah like i have been sleeping and like i just woke up because it hurts a lot and then i took the medication and now i feel much better but it's really weird time okay so but what what's going on so this thing this so this thing in the in leans then that's cool no i mean so is that the schooling leans from which these guys so are part of the part of the the students who come from that school are the ones are the ones who organized the camp that you're going to right i mean i guess people in that crowd is mostly from that school right in linz i mean it's not the big city that's what i know yeah i have never been there there before so i mean neither it's quite something um but yeah i think it's not like completely um run by the school but it's it's like another organization but i think there's a lot of connection yeah yeah yeah because from from what i know is that from ours from from wires electronica what i know is that that's because already they're doing stuff and this um but they have different things running at the same time so right this is somehow i think in the program who i'm being involved with some kind of like a showcasing within them basically but i yeah but i haven't talked to him i just know it is like since within the week of arts electronica right yes but what i know is it's just massive and also like you know i think if you just want to show something i think it's not so hard to get in it's just hard to go to the main exhibition to present yes something that you have to cure it but or get the award but that's also a weird thing like you don't have to get the award to to exhibit right right because because the awards is something different yeah it's completely different and there are other more uh um you know then they really try to see like about innovation you know like functionality [Music] yeah this kind of weird line between functionality and something that is still is artistic which in a way has this contradiction by itself right from from starting from the point of view that it's just like you know the this artist this expression has pure expression not there is no message in there i mean from that understanding in in that way so then when you in the line the functionality already you have the the conflict yeah i mean which is it that is designed right in a way yeah the design is is that applied creativity right yeah and art will be like the liberal arts yeah yeah yeah i mean that's holy co that's how we call it in in english no like like or does it the literal translation from in netherlands is i think it's like liberal arts i think okay i don't know how he's in german i don't know how how how how is yeah because i think because i think like in the way in spanish you will speak about arts is which is funny because what i was saying is that you have plastic arts that's that's that's the literal translation in spanish you will say artes plasticus which literally means like plastic arts and i remember when i arrived and i was like saying that to find artists they felt like you know as like are you a plastic art and they feel a bit offended oh because they yeah yeah i i think flora also says that in her area like i also i think that's what she studied maybe i don't know could be i i don't know how it is here and especially the school i mean this really strange school i never heard like i mean i know that there they have two or three um how do you call it uh faculty no like the like categories like you know um anyways so one of them is art like you're wearing like it's called kunst oh how is called in german yeah i think you call it art yeah or english art like there's nothing else i have i have never heard of something like that before like studies i have i have never heard of studies of arts yeah like as a career like arts yeah i think what we have is art and ex-media which i still don't know what it means it sounds like a variable x media whatever whatever is that x media but it's so funny because ex-media people um like like next week i have an appointment to visit the ex-media lab where they have the equipment and i'm gonna which but that means like because x media sounds to me more close to me to multi i mean the sense more like yeah so but more like net net based art yeah yeah let me finish so i go to x media lab to do some printing like like a wrestle graph or something um so it's just like like literally like printing posters and stuff i i i think that's not something that you would expect with expedia right no no no no no no no no no completely now that's the one respect that's what it feels so strange yeah okay i found i found the website on the school where it says about ex-media expedia is an academic group which shares the conviction that experimental aesthetic projects and social technical research lead to expansion of scholarly and creative horizons that effectively address existential human condition in 21st century i don't know what it means ex-media but integrates design coding sound and animation x-media then you have critical reflection with experimental approaches based on fundamental questions raised by individuals and society and so on but i found super weird because all these that you're speaking is like web web-based it's right like more web-based thing so it seems to me the funny thing is um some professors i know they do um with like net art they're really you know around there for some time lit art and they're in art they're not in ex-media you mean like fine arts no it's art i don't know it's not fine okay okay okay yeah okay meaning meaning that they are not like technology specialists right that's what he meant with that i mean i don't know if there's anyone who's like doing technical things i mean there are but i mean like not photoshopped i really don't know i am still discovering okay where i was cooking rice because i i was so hungry so i got the shop today this morning the first one and then it was fine for like a few hours and then it became you know like a flu or something yeah you know like start to like bully start to hurt yeah then i slept around i don't know 7 p.m and then i woke up because it hurts too much i'm gonna paint my nails man now that i see your nails are gonna turn my hair oh yeah i have to do it for tomorrow again yeah i have a panel tomorrow so i don't know how it's going to be maybe i'm just rolling on the floor with a with a pain so i'm going to do the printing next week and like printing what printing like physically printing yeah oh yeah because you told me about like that's okay that's like printing posters and stuff and like razor graph i think the idea is that you only have two or three uh different colors that's yeah yeah yeah and yeah i'm gonna just try to pick like a few practices that we had like you know primitive colors yeah i think that could be interesting oh yeah okay that's why you sent me the image of the of the red and the blue and white yeah i'm gonna hand pick something better but uh we'll see that's actually like i i was thinking it's like nails because nails you don't mix colors right you have to stick to the i mean i don't know what professional people would do but i mean some days ago before i came to bruce i uh no because i have the final presentation in my yeah i remember the final presentation of my of my school and then then i thought okay no i will just remove my nail polish i thought so then i asked my girlfriend can you help me to clean it up and then at some point she said like this this nail is green but the base was lit and at some point was coming sometimes yeah it's purple but at some point with some layer of green from some months before i guess oh oh you just say you painted on top yeah i just said just keep on doing that like yeah i think it's like it's like a nice social thing yeah that i can do with some people already yeah just you meet them you paint your nails yeah that's something i wanted a workshop at some point but i don't know how what like properly like like to really properly learn how to paint your nose like you know just doing a social thing oh you know in in path there was this thing it was called it was about feminism at some point and i mean let's say how the political complication of uh it was say that the point of encounter was to paint your nails that was the meeting point in puff so that was the meeting point path you see in a board and said like uh works of meeting works uh nail painting nails or something but it was with something with feminist i don't i don't remember exactly but there was somebody i guess create a nice catchy sentence which was involving painting nails and feminist readings also and it was super cool because it would it was one of the rooms it was full of like with really nice just like mattresses and then a lot of nail polishes and a lot of interesting and even could be like heavy books and a lot of people who really know about the the gender studies and stuff like that but the way how they bypass the heaviness of the politics on the concept was by let's come together and paid or nails and that was cool yeah i think it worked that's really something for um well i mean i don't call that as an activism but you know like if you do like activism thing always become really tense because of the subject [Music] what do you mean sorry it's really loud um another thing is like you know if if you protest for example then you know it's not something happy you're protesting against something and it's usually yes against um but of course there's always like politics within well i mean you it is a politics and it becomes really tense so it's it's really nice when there's something like um nails or you know something to like you said is it like bypassing but yeah but but but like for instance if you i think martin at some point like in one of his i don't know one of his things he said like you know for instance like a manifestation happens very often then people will do this you know when people do paradigm so basically when they go do kind of uh people go with music you know or start dancing or stuff like that to become very happy and and that's super cool because that animates the political manifestation of something but i mean critically you cannot say that that's art if you if you if you know what i mean but did you get what i'm trying to say with that yeah and in this in the in the sense that it's very functional you know it's just it's to uh entertain and to give some yeah just to put some music and make things fun basically it's functional right i mean this is like always a question you know like is it is like activism art you know like because a lot of artists um are activists as well and what does it mean and to be honest i think that's kind of um stupid argument but what is art and what is activism um to me because i mean right practically it doesn't really matter whatever you do and people like it that's fine but what i think what i really think is interesting for example like i saw a talk of um activism like activists such artists in the us like he was involved in um like occupy wall street and stuff and he was he he what he's interesting what is interesting about him is that um like he does it as activism but also like he runs like workshops for example where people come it doesn't necessarily have to be active the artists but you know they'd have this workshop to to talk about or like make a timeline of that like actual history not what is told but uh what is you know with the people color for example um and frame that as an artwork on the outcome of the workshop which is very good because but based on politics so because i think i think i got lost in what you were saying so he runs workshops and that outcome for example you know just people come to a table and uh [Music] to i don't know what he exactly uses but maybe write something about the history or um [Music] you know like there's like material like maybe even books magazines you just collect them and figure out what is the actual history um and then okay okay you make you make a like panel or something and that is an artwork which is i mean again you can argue if it's an artwork or something i don't know didactic or something you know practical in a sense that it's not art you but i'm not really interested in that part because if like he makes these things with people that is part of activism but also like really practically curators come to you and say you know that's the show and that's the show above exhibitable in as it is which is really smart i think like it's it's kind of uh i don't say i don't want to say it like as a marketing strategy but i think it's it's really nice no but i think it kind of kind of kind of works in the sense of say if like what you're doing somehow is like working within [Music] uh texts about politics and stuff like that but your focus is not in the content but rather in the way how you are archiving or manipulating the content then at the end what you will showcase although is full of political content is interesting because you are not focusing in just archiving the best material for the best but it's more an organic process sure i mean i think you can interpret in different ways but i think what it is interesting to me is that it's not just he's um how do you say it yeah like what he makes is something that he can exhibit which is really cool it's a bit like you know um i know i don't know if it's a similar idea but we talked about uh so what if we show all the videos we did with the practice in a museum for example you know like it's it's not that we prepare something for a specific exhibition but something that we can use like the material that we already have i mean although i mean in our case it's not something that we are aiming for showing in that way but could we just i mean and we never have contemplated that idea like imagine that you put together all the materials including the chats that we do together as just one long shot so it is like 170 hours how much food time will be that as a loop uh calculator now it is 100 680 hours divided by 24 hours i guess per day yeah that's more than a week so it's 7.5 days yeah like one way one week of con like so it is one week of loop non-stop material right i think that's i mean this is a bit detour but going back to the workshop activism idea i mean it doesn't have to be activism but um like we talked about you know sandboxing and workshops about the practice and that could be uh interesting not just to say that this is a workshop but it's it actually has another life as you know um as something as an outcome of each workshop it's not really concrete idea but i think i think it makes sense you know but actually you should i'm just wondering how the computer will be [Music] like if you put 108 hours of sorry i'm sorry now i'm on the video uh don't worry don't don't be sorry i've seen you but and i've heard of you but that's it no good things and and she's one of the the teachers that i have in the school and she's also working with me in the in the installation that we do yeah with seeds yeah no i'm not in the teacher mode right yeah so i think so it depends on what you teach i watch depends on what you teach and so yeah but i was just wondering like really just trying to think like if i load i don't know how with the computer like trying to just put all the material together in a timeline if my computer will just will just do fine [Music] i mean it just a part of the time you know that it just normally takes time just to make one video i'm just wondering it should be okay because there is not it's not like one uh 4k with massive amount of layers to create this uh heavy load for the processing power of the computer right it's just one long uh 720 video i have no idea how it works because sometimes you know the whole video has to be on the ram but that's not possible i think if it's too big but maybe it doesn't work that way it just blows the chunk of the video on the ram and playback but i actually don't know um it could be cool that could be cool as a base but like as a website just try to put all the 180 hours in a website that just maybe maybe we just like put everything on the streaming once and then we have like a huge stream but but then nevertheless that we have to create demonstrating well like you can somehow mix them with the program right like i don't know how it works but what do you mean like it's like that just the videos in youtube they're just triggered every time as a playlist actually yeah this is a playlist yeah like a dlc playlist and then just goes through and just that's captured by obs and then yeah yes so yeah i want to lay lie down lie down um not feeling well go forward go for it uh maybe just before we go we just close it um i don't but i don't know if it's really really no but we should upload it we should we should upload it because we haven't spoke anything private here this seems like okay so just uh you know every time this this whatever from brew in belgium thanks so much", "GRZcuvPTqto": "recording in process hello everyone welcome back to chad we just have a practice we just finished a practice i think has been almost two weeks the last time we did the practice yeah i think was that three two weeks i guess yeah when we did invite uh floor right it feels like one month or something like i was thinking this morning it feels really long oh yeah i mean we both had like different projects during that time so that's but it was really cool really cool yeah i really enjoy it because i have been just thinking way too much on this it's just so boring i mean but this is really cool because the chat is going to come the chap is the time but the two of us and sometimes a guest speaker come to conceptualize and theorize about the practice i i mean this is just this is me this is me in my presentation this is me this is me speaking from a script the chat is the time with the two of us and sometimes i get i guess expert is invited for to theorize and conceptualize the practice [Music] huh this is just this is like a machine i don't feel like just uh and this last row for i wrote it like last for like half an hour to an hour but usually it's like around an hour and we have a massive yeah yeah like i've seen this text like 100 times already like i i mostly wrote it and i use it everywhere and you used it everywhere this uh text about the chat or about the frost yeah yeah practice as well so yeah that some that's flow is so natural right this is kind of interesting i mean i didn't like when i started you know when we started writing about the practice or about the chat we didn't expect that it's going to be like you know used again and again i mean it's of course we can do it but when you write something you never expect that we'll use it for the website we'll use it for applications we use it for the maximums yeah yeah this is just i mean tomorrow i have the presentation and for me will be oh like a milestone and then we just can talk of different things but it just feels so dense you know like a big because we have been talking of this in the past like in order to get invisibility so then basically just if we're speaking in a way like a weird language that we create with practices then just we need to basically translate that for other people who don't speak the language right uh and that's just normal otherwise we'll do the two of us which was very fun at the beginning just like the two of us and just do the thing and just uh like what do we like but we did today you know then yeah i mean we yeah we still do it but it's just started to you know um i don't know what's such a interesting analogy but i mean we open the gate we don't uh we don't go to other city other town to to invite people but if someone comes then they're welcome no um but yeah i think the exercise because i don't know if you saw like oh also this guy pablo from the input that answered you saw that also you're going to say i know what which one wait is this a public chat or not this is a public one but yeah it was a short thing mark yeah uh okay uh i'm just seeing right now if you you were yeah you were there okay and what and i know that just i'm thinking that for the because they want okay this becomes this is this is this is a public chat so let's not talk of these things but what i'm trying to say from there is that the presentation let's say uh i'm gonna record it and i will i will uh i think i will share if i record it then because i think is an exercise is is interesting as an exercise i don't i don't think it's super interesting as an artistic something but i think it's certainly interesting as asking practicing how to communicate with people who maybe are not interested yeah yeah just the exercise of the presentation because different when you talk about the subject with everybody people who are very interested in listening what you have to say um yeah and now i just mentioned the impressions because i think they want us to do some presentation of the work so which i wish of course is not gonna be like what i'm doing tomorrow something like that thanks god or be something like that but nevertheless there should be something more queer like morning morning in still like should present the the parts of the work in a way that people kind of understand in a way what is it but at the same time with more close to the q and o then yeah exposing or that we have master the best practices or what they think about what what is their best practice or whatever i don't know [Music] but it's nice we have uh already i think it's not official but uh two opportunities i think to present one is in the so the another one in uh in germany but i mean that this one the schedule is not public but it's oh i'm proud of that yeah yeah we're good with that yeah yeah yeah yeah so we have some stuff coming up this summer which is kind of yeah i mean interesting like last year well last year we had the node like around summer we started talking about the node in the summer we're starting in summer we're starting buff that's the way how we start i mean that was more like the uh it's so weird because if i see for instance like what i did like when i checked the history of the practices it's path in a way that it marks like from my point of view to big uh changes or like yeah like um milestones or like times where something becomes more concrete so like the last year in summer we just we actually started working in the framework and then this year we proposed the the long the livestream the long the corruption in february yeah yeah it's true and we talked a lot also we did a lot of interesting chats while we were there because you were there also virtually so yeah i mean somehow i had time and yeah we did a one-day format we did a lot of chat through yeah sorry yeah also that was the time uh when we were writing application with joanna yes yes yeah yeah hey i wanted to talk of uh how was experience what happened what happened what happened today how was the experience if we do it in like real life i it will be amazing uh at impostance we would do make a circle actually how was the experience of listening to us talking about this weird thing it's the most authentic thing to do yes uh yeah i mean for today uh where should we start i don't know it was i mean we haven't done one hour for some time right no in a long time like could be maybe even not in buff i think the last i think the one i think there was one day that we did not uh a long format but still we did two hours i think could be half a year no not that long because when i did my uh my birthday was almost half year ago actually yeah yeah yeah that wasn't yeah so it's anyway it's almost half year that we have we have not done the practice uh just one hour practice actually that was uh march 25th uh yeah we did one hour with live streaming oh well anyway it has been a long time so we we got basically we got used to having the time to to yeah basically develop i guess something uh yeah yeah yeah like today maybe like today for instance if i speak from my side so when there are often things happening and i don't completely understand what is happening then i go ocd and i just trying to really understand what is happening and that that's when i then that's when you see me really close to the computer and like just and then it's just me trying to understand but how this comes and today really fast at the beginning there was something i didn't completely understand it was some feedback that i didn't understand from where it was coming from but then i thought okay okay it's cool whatever and then i just keep it in the one window and then i start working other things so i did not i i moved more this time way more i was moving at loads yeah i mean i really tried to you know keep it simple not to open you know different like recorders and my editor and stuff i just decided okay i just stick to hydra that the original hydra and then you know just do something simple um ended up opening a lot of tabs but and i have the windows old windows also open but i think windows was nice because that really it's really cool limits uh what you can do with it you know like well especially because that window is like the server version so there's like some weird constraints about accessing um different like websites like some websites are blocked and stuff like that yeah yeah i was like so i couldn't really do anything with my internet explorer and then i opened but that was good yeah that was that was cool because then i was thinking and i was using your that your text editor because you have you were having all these errors in this font of windows and it was very cool to see uh yeah then i switched to the wordpad and you know just writing some stuff there i mean just hashtags but um and i also use the program that floor is making i mean i also edited a little bit so yeah i open it it also has the you know feedback kind of thing so it was nice but yeah with that one and also with the windows i did like chroma key so i put some green colors in it so that you can layer them on top of each other which is i think it's nice now i have my windows with a green background wait and um what is the i want to talk about this no wait so what is uh is it possible to how are you doing the house floor doing 3d uh in hydra is it a hydra or is it a different framework um it's with the p5.js oh so it's like combined with yeah it's combined with hydra like basically they all ends up in a web canvas so you can mix them like you can load p5.js canvas inside hydra or vice versa but it's a library it's a mpm library yeah i mean it's not um it's not really made for npm but you can use it like that too so the way what you're doing is like you you do it locally so like or how do you do that um i mean because it's front end usually how you do it the proper way is you have to use some kind of um how to say it like you know bundler what what's the right name like there's tools like browserify oh yeah these things that the it runs like the script and you know the bundle mixes yeah fixes the dependencies with from hydra or different libraries and then put them together in one file so you can just load that file into your web page and it runs but i think how she's doing is just uh you can also use cdn so you just like include these scripts from cdn like where it's hosted and you just load hydra as a script and you load p5.js on the script so it's not bundled but it's still like they're all like exposed to the global use the libraries like we build the dependencies yeah it just becomes like a variable so hydra becomes just hydra like a global variable so it's not really recommended way to do it but it works and yeah it's it's easy because you don't have to compile and you know compiling this uh or not compile but bundling javascript is always uh somewhat like a bit of a work it's not really straightforward everyone has a different recipe of course yeah but i have like more hours i want to talk about like because i have seen sometimes what uh things that she's doing and then i wanted to talk about like this 3d images in that space uh because it feels like since so let's say uh it's not blender or is uh it's not a software dedicated for 3d uh rendering images right so the quality of the image of course would be different and what i found that is there is something that i'm missing from that is i don't know what is it but it's it's not that i want to see the high end image but there is you know there is something missing i don't know what is it but this there is something missing in the in trying to simulate the 3d in a two-dimensional space yeah i should i do like screen share and try to find something interesting or i can do obs as always um window capture [Music] because maybe for people who are not very uh familiar with 3d softwares like uh dedicates like uh blender or i don't know uh howdini or others one other ones is that in those of words the the is the that makes a 3d model uh which is very complex uh complex and what the auto will share in a little time is uh you know ways is to simulate the 3d space in a two-dimensional space through i guess using a lot of the perspective yeah so there are like different ways to do it um for example i mean okay a-frame is not the first thing i would show so p5g is the one that she was using i don't know if you've seen it but it's like it's for let's say education like it's easy to use is the processing on the web in a way yeah that's that's the idea and where can i find it reference or it's examples maybe and because on web you can do with webgl like 3d stuff so there are like examples that you know you can do this um you can draw these shapes in a fairly simple code like this yeah without without creating like a complex mesh uh in a three-dimensional space yeah but that's of course that comes at the cost that it's not really flexible you can what raycasting oh okay raycasting it's like great tracing in a way no no it's just uh finding where the mouse position is like where it hits on the uh 3d object like whatever um you can do like shader stuff but it's it's very simple i think this one is drawn in shader so it's like the very simple version of ray tracing uh ray martial so these things you can do but it's really simple and i have to say it's not so um optimized so you can do some more elaborate stuff but it might not perform well and of course if you go to like shader toy or uh okay then like i wanted to show this one a-frame because this is quite nice um i mean it's it's similar but it has a bit better shading i would say and oh the source i mean the nice thing i cannot really see it here but uh the syntax is uh it's like html so you ra you write a box just like you know having like image or p tag i can show you the code they hosted on glitch so it's it's really slow which i i mean i wouldn't say it's slow but it takes time so that's why i hate it but i mean the call is like it's like p5.js not similar it matter but it's simple enough that you don't have to initialize the buffer initialize this and that to make this image your source yeah this is just like i just want to go straight to the source and this takes like forever to load it yeah but maybe what i wanted to talk is that because in so in the first part when i was researching in the first semester about 3d images and how so at some point i end up trying to so it work it works very well let's say in i was using notch for that which is a software also that you can use for 3d 3d images complex to the images and it works very well of course if you are just in the 3d space and that's your purpose but at the point where i was trying to let's say put my camera so my image in the 3d space and try to do things with it although so it in a way i think it conflicts or it it bothers me that the there is the dimensionality that uh yeah to put in the flat image of my webcam in the 3d in the 3d space it just feels uh it's not it's not the same dimension so when when we do uh when we glitch in a two-dimensional space saying hydra then everything so it doesn't matter how many more layers or images uh we are putting in the canvas because although they are glitching in a way they have they come from the same in the same dimension so when there's glitch or things that yeah for instance like this is this is this is a high definition through space right yeah so this is uh what it's called a 3js which is you know way more realistic but it's just it's the same thing you know it just runs on the browser and it does um what is it like yeah like just shading and you have like different geometries that makes it a bit more um realistic but it's the same engine that it's using on the browser and again it's the same like if you have videos images of ourselves in there it's not really it doesn't really fit well yeah i think like what what i found that is kind of like maybe it's not a limitation but because it might be from other point of view the possibility to explore the medium is that once we uh like trying to blend this the 3d 3d images and the 2d images i think that either one has to in a way respect a lot more the canvas uh because otherwise it gets saturated and it gets very messy very fast so you don't really it's not that you have to understand because when we're glitching we don't really understand what is happening everything but is just the composition itself becomes very messy and and also because i mean there is all this like uh romanticism with the image for instance that that when the 3d image is is well done so you can appreciate very well this image right and when you start putting more things on top very fast you lose the the good quality of the of the object itself so it's very i think it's a very very interesting topic to research but i think it's very complicated because you have to it's not yeah because actually it's not a two-dimensional a space and it's not a three-dimensional space it's something in between and i think yes maybe that's what i'm trying to say i think that's the conflict that when you try to do something in the 3d space and you do things in the 3d space then it works uh but when ordering the two-dimensional space but when you put the two together uh the dimension uh conflict the the whole thing um i don't know i don't know what do you think about this um yeah i i totally understand i mean that's i would say we never really tried in the practice i think but i think that's something i'm really interested for example oh well so it's really i mean the way well yeah yeah sorry like yeah the way i see it is like in a way i think if we we want to try to do or when somebody try to do this kind of experiments where 2d and 3d is mixed in a way it has to be a conscious understanding that what is going to be proposed is something that is not 2d and 3d but it's something else and that has to be in a way conceptualized and understood uh a part of the technical limitation and all these things that just on on the spot you have to find so in a way is the under or like i will say like it's the proposition of a new dimension basically yeah so this one is uh i made for the seminar it's in mozilla hubs so you can anyone can join like social vr and these 3d models are scanned from the real life with a photogrammetry and at one point i was using it um like in hydra like just as a screen share so i can put myself in the space in a way and it's it doesn't really solve the problem but at least these images are captured with the photos yeah okay okay you know it has somewhat similar quality although you know it's still you can see it as a 3d rendering but it's a yeah like just a bit closer to the real like a texture of the image or i think you can also digitize yourself with the kinect for example and then if you add things on top of your image then maybe it blends better but but uh but the thing is if you start to go into that direction it's hard to do it in real time right i mean you can do it in real time but changing these effects in real time um i guess you can still like adjust some parameters to make how much you add the glitch or change the color or something but it cannot really um change the whole composition with like while we are practicing yeah yeah yeah yeah true yeah yeah there is something there like yeah the the manipulation of the truth the two space and the tree space like there is something there um yeah there is something there that is i think my my thinking is just conceptually thinking that it has to be understood before going to the technology itself as something that is not 2d or 3d i think in a way i mean that's my easier way i guess to think about it um but then again it's like it's difficult to imagine a new dimension when uh yeah it's difficult to imagine something that you cannot perceive through your senses you know if you understand that is 2d and you know what is to be you know what is 3d um so it's difficult to imagine a new dimension because you don't have i mean yeah basically it's close to the idea of the post-human life basically you have just to not use the resources of your cognitive process but it's more almost like a dream land sure and it it has to be like not convincing but it has to you have to have something like you cannot just try something and i mean you can try something but if you if it's you know if you're trying something then it's obviously you're trying something with 2d and 3d so you have to have some kind of maybe maybe maybe maybe it could be also in the in in terms of composition in hierarchy or one can even speak about choreography in that sense that in a way the problem with using 3d objects is like that in a way once you propose a 3d object you want to perceive the object as such so you don't want the object to be too much corrupted or at least you want to understand as viewer [Music] you need to understand there is a the object uh uh then then going back to the idea of the choreography i think maybe it's more in terms of timing if you want to use a process where the 3d object get glitch i think this should be the time enough for the viewer to understand that that object actually the glitch object it comes from a clear form that you can understand in a way um okay um [Music] i i'll just show you like before answering to that um so this is something i did uh last week oh yeah yeah i was in the real like physical uh space where this tunnel is and i use the the scanned model that i just showed you which is like in the background with the luma key but you don't really notice that it's 3d or something else i mean it didn't really move it much so but so our question is that like a scan to a 3d scanning is that a scan truth uh so and the the foreground i mean this uh you know what's surrounding and myself is the camera but the background the in the middle where now it's you know shaking a little bit is the 3d model of the of the same space so i try to like you know the the tunnel is like oh how do i say it i extend the tunnel in a way with the 3d model and then i think it works because in a way something like that works because in that case in a way the 3d space works as a canvas sort of you know as a kind of base ground from where other 2d image can come so then what they is there is not a conflict um and it fits yeah it it feels yeah it is not conflicting then the conflict is when that base ground start moving or start doing weird stuff uh yeah when the 3d space let's say that bass ground start maybe to do certain motions it will start uh very fast corrupting the whole image which again going back to the idea of choreography i think maybe that could be a cue uh for flores if she's seen from what i think more could be in terms in terms of written you know because for instance that background can move maybe but the speed of the motion uh it needs to have a different rhythm because it's a base ground so you cannot start just shaking so fast as the 2d image [Music] yeah no i mean this you you mean like also like what you said before is about like this kind of discrepancy between the 2d and 3d right it's because you want to perceive as something yeah now now actually i'm moving a little bit in the background you see um but yeah if but you see when you do but you see that work like what is i think it's in terms of like the choreographic or composition like the written the rhythm uh i think will dictates a lot more than it more than the 3d object itself i think is just the simplicity of the 3d and then playing with the the rhythm i think as a beginning to start exploring the field um but going from the beginning with a lot of motion and things uh makes the thing very dense i think yeah i i think in my case i was trying to like do like you know not glitch the 3d model too much because it's already you know somewhat glitchy it's not real you know if you look close to it so what i was trying was to make the the camera image the 2d part that surrounding or the body of myself with a little bit of you know like changing the color like now um so that it doesn't necessarily blend but they both have some kind of this glitch in the image to make it make them more connected in a way i don't know if i really succeeded in that um but [Music] yeah like if if we just treat it as image as 3d model then as you said it's it's not going to blend and you know um yeah but i don't know where i want to do actually i was thinking about you doing this today but i think i didn't do it except what floor was doing uh in the webpage so that can be something also like i was i wanted to do some recording of myself which i didn't do um but at one point i want to like film myself without not with a desktop but with a camera that that's not connected to the computer and just film myself moving um because that could be an interesting material uh for example if you do something with 3d then maybe working with my whole body would be easier than working with the windows in the desktop well i don't know yeah because for instance like the the windows actually if you really think about it i think the windows the floating windows in a way are a 3d object if you know what i mean like those windows they end up being an object once you put them in inside of the composition of the screen they demand a lot of attention uh i think i think that's a good analogy like the the windows in a way are are a simulation of a 3d object they have shadows they have this kind of things they try to simulate the object as something there is more more than just being flat well but i think the current trend in the design is to make it flat that's true which is kind of funny i mean it's sometimes still really uh this confusing uh to me you know i don't know which is actually in the foreground and switching to the background um but actually like we once did with hubs you know we totally failed at node but it was in hubs and we did what we did we put ourselves in the greenhouse we put the when we then when we perform a node then we share the screens yeah but that was because the one i shared right now is different because it's hubs inside hydra in a way with a screen share like screen capture but what we did it at node was hydra inside the house so that it's shared inside hops as a flat screen yeah but what i shared is the other way around which we didn't try i think in our practice no yeah i see what i mean yeah yeah so i think going back to this idea i think it works you know uh let's say in in our performance basically just we use that ground to share our screens and then we didn't move there no just you put it there and then the screen is staying there so again the canvas of the or the 3d space is the base ground and in a way let's say it work in the sense that because there is not the the base ground was not moving or whatever it's just very flat there's nothing more than just holding the two screens and inside of the two screens and things were happening um yeah but then to bring in the 3d space uh so that was bringing the two display to the space into the 3d space but as you said doing the other way around so bringing the 3d space in a two-dimensional space um yeah it seems um well i don't know if it's better or worse but something to try at least i think it's more i think it's more uh i would say that it's focused because you can focus you know in a three-dimensional space basically once you're there you can as a viewer you can watch everywhere right you can go and check everywhere around but uh in the tools these in the two the 2d space you have just one screen so it's focused yeah it's true you don't have to think about the perspective or where you are exactly i mean yeah because already there's a lot of information yeah yeah but it's funny right because even if it's a photo it's it's happening in 3d space and someone's taking that photo um but you never well you some people think about where the photographer is standing but sometimes you don't really think about it i'm just sharing my screen of the practice which i think we never did something like this in the practice like right after the practice we another chat right after the practice in the chat we share the you know what happened just like one hour ago uh but i think it's nice so i try it um so this was like at one point i was showing the windows and i put myself on top of it and i think this is kind of not three it's not 3d but it's nice nice example because i really didn't like it at the end because it's you know it's just so it feels so wrong you know that i'm putting myself it's like when you're shooting like a tutorial or something on a youtube you know tutorial thingy or coding or something well i think but i think there is something in that idea of uh it might be interesting with people like flor who are researching this for a while like like the windows actually those windows are a three object in a way they're trying to they're trying to simulate a 3d object more than yeah a video yeah you can see it just for the ugly design of windows 7 i don't know which windows is this um so it's an object it's a 3d object yeah yeah but then even if it's the windows are sort of flat 3d if you put yourself with a chroma key on top of it it it's i don't know if i like it like in this example but i think it's kind of what i think it works in let's say this is very simple because then you don't have let's say reflection with lights of all these kind of complex things that a 3d object will do but then you can focus i think that's interesting because let's say the lights and all these things are happening actually with you so with the camera so with you and all the shadows and all the lights so all these things are happening there and there are no complex lightings or other things happening in the 3d object so in a way it's not so disturbing it's not disturbing i mean this is super simple but i yeah i think that uh the simplicity uh in the 3d background is essential i think it must it must come at the beginning i think from i mean from both both ends right like the 3d thing should be simple enough and 2d parts should be somewhat having this uh not photorealistic but something comes to towards this glitch idea so that they kind of merge me at some point i mean that's what i think but um yeah i think you know in a way what i feel is that one i mean trying to experiment in in these dimensions one needs to be more responsible or more conscious actually of the elements like basically of yeah to not throw all the distortion rather at once because it's way too much and this is like the in the same week i was we were we made some posters in the physical space and this one mine is in the bottom left and it's just a screen capture of a window and i started really like to well i only tried this this time once but to what about if we print web pages and just stick it somewhere so that it's it's nice because people understand that it's a browser you know it's not like a design thing it's just a browser that's there um but what is it i i thought about it because in the video in the practice we did i was just sharing the screen but what if it was actually like looks like printed and taken as a photograph or you know we can do some uh like actually print it and just stick it there and as a you know thick photo or screen capture of the practice and then we dance in front of it then you know it's it's it's not a group that it's plain i think it's like i think that goes in the direction of like the immediate the medium is the message that we talked like two weeks ago with uh with floor but because basically the energy is experimenting and expanding more uh the medium uh so normally you want normally that poster will not be such a thing it will be something different so the expert experiment with the medium itself is yeah just like the medium this idea of the medium is the message is what it resonates in my head so give more possibilities to the medium to be that only what is supposed to do okay i mean which is which is very very much what the art visual artists do very much is or what you learn in in visual art is there they're very well trained to explore uh materials right like visual plastic arts to explore the materials and then to experiment different times so it makes me think of that um yeah that's really yeah yeah well i think what becomes interesting is we can play both with the medium and the content because well in a way medium becomes content if i print as a poster and stick it uh of a screenshot of a chrome but still you know have something in the chrome window that can be practiced or it can be hashtag or whatever um web page we make um then i think it's and then if we for example use it in practice or not um then things become more interesting because in a way by moving through a different medium we make a new practice basically yeah that's i don't i don't know they are they're not part of instagram world anymore but i don't know if you saw like florida at some point like this last week and um i think she was she did some kind of uh like almost a stock motion of hydra so then she started drawing have you seen it yeah yeah she sent me that was a that was very that was very very cool because that's that's going in the same idea right uh it's very cool because it goes around the same idea like the drawings are not amazing but and that's the cool because there's not a point of trying to simulate what the computer can do perfectly right there's just no point in that right hmm that's that's something um i mean i don't exactly know but that kind of makes me think of like when we think about you know documentation and how to archive stuff we try to make it somewhat complicated because we have you know really rich data or history but maybe it's just about for example just printing out the screenshot of practice um and you know just have pile of it just put it somewhere or use it in a practice like we like i just said that is already creating like exploring with an archive or we can just you know make bunch of websites that just shows the um screenshot of the the practice also i saw like olivia olivia jack she shared with me sometime that it's a web page but it shows like a chrome window kind of thing and it starts to glitch um but it's i think it's along the idea of you know working with the mouse cursor and stuff that yeah become part of the the content the browser becomes the content yeah yeah yeah yeah this is very interesting the topic maybe we can go back that the idea of like we are basically exploring more the explorer the chrome uh the browser as yeah yeah more than just something that it holds a website right yeah and oh after all this thing we just like dancing without any almost no effects it's so funny but it was cool because then then then i also i understood okay let's dance and also i felt so i put some music and then i i felt that okay you're putting a different music so then i listen and i just put down my music and then i start dancing with you you see yeah i was i was being very nice today yeah i was feeling very nice okay well maybe we should close this here um and yeah let's keep in touch so maybe just let's close that so thank you for watching uh thank you for watching i forgot what to say please like the video i mean i some people like it which i really really appreciate and uh uh yeah and some people subscribe to the channel so it's it's growing like really like gradually amazing so but maybe at one point i should do the tutorial series again to kind of boost exposure anyways tutorial series on 3d space and 3d space let's make a conference of 2da and 3d the new dimension yeah i mean that's that's totally interesting right i mean like okay what what's what floor is doing i think is very interesting i think like in terms of aesthetics like i would say like i might not like her like some things but i think the research that she's going through and that is very interesting because i think it's a very complicated topic for what all they said here so florida if you're watching super cool what are you doing very beautiful drawing okay ciao", "2gOS750neh4": "time i'm working so it's fine okay hello world turn off the looping yeah hello hello naoto hello people in the chat uh yes so this was the short wheel for the presentation of my school um the erasmus obviously brussels and and yet now you were sharing about you were like these days you were working with editing video no yeah so we had like one week of seminar and like last week well five days plus a little bit on sunday and basically it's like experiment like it's not like well some students prepared some installations and then they install it but um a few students were just like hanging out well like working on their stuff and just it's more like open studio you know like it's not like you present as an exhibition but they were just keep working and showing whatever projection sound work that's there and i did some uh well i'm not you know like i didn't really do it professionally but i brought my action camera like a little gopro kind of camera and uh i was yeah editing videos just trying to make a show real kind of thing and yeah so that's that's why like i was just editing the video when you when you uh sent me something a message and but you were mentioning for you're mentioning for something in particular uh yeah because um so i don't know how you how you edited it but basically for me um the sound is uh i'm using the sound from one of the students she is um music producer and basically yeah her her song is you know like techno and if you use like that kind of sound then you really want to synchronize the video like really okay on the beach on the beat yes yeah yeah yeah by the way uh just to shout out uh swan swan meet that's her hardest name if you search on i don't know spotify or something you can find it um this is really cool sweet name yeah this one meat i thought so i'm big maybe you should consider it to spam paper because it presents oh no but the way how i was like doing this because this comes from like now to these like four minutes uh sure real at some point when actually in that track in that chat we were discussing the we showed it here right yeah yeah yeah yeah and i and also i highlight that in the in my magazine as user testing because kind of like one of yeah the only time we have like really feedback from people when we collect these questions and we actually did it one by one uh you and me together trying to and then we propose this q and o instead of a q a right questions and options instead of a q an answer and yeah but so what i was so what i was saying is that the way how i was i played with the sound i thought before because i was supposed to uh yeah to do just 30 seconds i felt like okay should be very uh exciting and fast you know more like a product almost kind of thing like pushing like more as a teaser and then i thought maybe i should just like really select the proper music with a high vibe and something but then through the video i found that because there are so different chunks of the practice the practice itself have uh in this case it has this sound of cyprus heal there in the background uh and then i just use that as a as the music and and then yeah then i you i kind of like at some point i i think i start like i plan to do almost because it was 30 seconds to to do like i don't know i kind of like divided the very strictly like every clip for i don't know five seconds or something but then after it was very boring because it's just like boom boom boom and you can still see what is happening which is good from the the short wheel that you present is are long clips so you can you can still have some have more sense of what is happening before it jumps to the next one so in this one the time was not working like that uh and then it has to be more dynamic so then i just use yeah i just throw away my idea of like strictly clips in that way and then just put it in some kind of more easier kind of way i guess yeah for for me it's well i named it sure because why not but uh it's like four minutes and the reason why i did it was because of like one of the submissions i think like video um to give an idea of what we do so that's why it's not like a real show real um yeah anyways but i think what is cool from this is because i'm i now i start i have started thinking to the my defense of my my thesis in my school and then i think in the teaching itself i will show or either this video that you made before there is four minutes or i might select other chunks but like long chunks to give more sense uh of what is happening because i think that was more the per that's how i take more the purpose or it works uh the functionality of the video is in letting know the person who is watching uh what is happening or to give a bit more of time for the person to stay a little bit between all these things that are happening so for me uh i think this i would call more like a video this kind of video is it should be self-explanatory in the sense of a practice right like like not in the sense of manipulating information which in a way is how i feel more or less i did with this with a short real you know they're just using the beeping certain way and just kind of put a cool as a product kind of teaser teasing somebody but i think that if one wants to use a video to ex to support an idea like in the sense like the presentation then i will let something run for longer periods with chunks because then the person itself can slow down and try to make its own connection with what is happening maybe as well it can get bored and just start watching his phone but it's fine it's that's what we do yeah i mean that's that's the hard part right um i think in my version there is one or two videos from the development no not the development but like uh the beginning of practice when not many things are happening because i thought it um specifically for that submission i wanted to give the idea of how yeah just like you said you know how the how long it is and how you know it's not just like everything's um choreographed and you know just going next so next yeah something that i think i was thinking also is like i'm kind of like prepared to it was also clear clarified in my magazine at some point when i explained the framework is that i said that one might like or not like one or this practice or this practice because of the aesthetics or because of music or because the internet delay or because because and that's totally fine because the practicing itself as we know but maybe some people who are here now they don't know is the practice itself is not the pro there's not a product or there's not a final aiming with the practice more than practicing so then it's totally fine if one practice is not i mean it's trying to give agency in a way to the person to decide by themselves like i don't like this one uh and yeah and i'm thinking already in that like yeah and because for instance like i was thinking in my in the last live stream that we have i have massive delays that at the last part when we are dancing and then my movements are like super chunk so is not as good as it happens with yours there is next next to it um it's just because it's like screen sharing and all these things right it slows down the computer or the network yeah i don't know what was it because when my computer i it wasn't delay but when i seen the streaming it was delayed yeah i i was i already noticed when we were doing the practice yeah i see because you have this small screen of a small square of myself there and i saw myself there i was delayed like yes yeah but that's yeah i mean that's something like i sometimes like consciously try to have less load on the computer so it doesn't lag too much um and also like this is more like a stage design but like these days i try to make um at one point i try to make this the whole desktop like really clean and just have one or two windows in there um yeah that's more like aesthetics um aesthetical decision and i like it at the same time i try to you know make sure that it's not like i'm not trying to to reach something with this you know it's not that i try to find a nice picture like instagramable thing or like it's hard because then it feels like next time i have to make this nice image again right and that really limits what i want to do yeah like i mean but but i think i was reflecting on the last live stream we have the last practice and what i liked very much from that practice is that i was so unprepared that i was not so that i didn't have time to stress and then it was very it just is very cool i mean it's just very joyful to uh it just brings a lot of joy because i don't have if i will have time maybe i will i will think maybe i will try to do something similar that works some session before and as you said that my already it puts you it puts you in a place no yeah yeah and wait last time were you using vdmx or what the last time i used bdmx yeah and uh yeah this this we already talked about in the last chat i think with floor like you know that kind of the communication thing that sometimes you know i don't know if i should talk to you or not but uh yeah but last time was really chill i think but i think it also was cool that because i mentioned to an autism time ago like maybe i don't know when exactly maybe two weeks ago that that i wish to maybe use more more my putas and things that like like is it this this kind of word is like a bad word or like cursing in spanish and that's something that in my personal life i do i just that's the way i express myself often and the way how we were doing uh often because things are not working very often is like we try to then not stress too much out and then say everything is fine more or less in that line and and two weeks ago i experienced now to the maybe i would like not to be or to express that maybe everything is not fine from my point and if i need it then to express but that's interesting because then of course it has to be another londoner so i have to communicate with naoto um so although i want to express and find my my fully a place where i feel that i can i can that i can completely express myself i'm not alone so is this tiny place where yeah there's the negotiation between that the two of us basically right yeah yeah yeah and uh i think from how is it second to the last practice and the last one also uh i was using more videos uh like dance yeah that's true videos how come yeah how come that yeah that's true yeah yeah sorry but it's just no that's that's because of you because uh like i think the one uh not the last one but the second to the last we talked about using your text yeah in some ways and then because uh for your thesis or magazine and that has some text about the history of like digital art and stuff right and there's the namjoon pick and uh who else was it um yeah yeah so that that video which which is funny because i think i've seen that video yeah i saw it at the tech museum when i visited in korea it was on the huge screen but somehow i kind of forgot about it uh and someone i don't know how these things work but someone uh uploaded on youtube so i was playing it yeah i will share this this image for a second oh no okay i just share my can you see this yeah yeah yeah so that's the that's one of the image that it was built during the practice yeah and uh well it's hard to see it but in the background the the video is there uh from the mers by merce by tech and the text is overlaid on top it's really condensed um but it's so but it's so perfectly done like you're almost like you're hugging it it really feels like like would be very difficult to you know always when you're working in these two-dimensional spaces like when you when bodies come close and they touch each other you know like the perfect example of what i'm trying to say is when trying to put feet on the ground right that's really difficult to really make it realistic somebody like feeds on the ground and this one it looks like really really well done like you're like like i'm there you're hugging me it's so cool yeah and um yeah i mean this was really nice i mean and also like i think i consciously choose the colors uh at some point i think there was one from september or something that i about that one i was read but because jorge often uh you use the red color on your body and i thought like that's like so you use red and i use blue somehow and that's kind of the color palette that uh like these days i like i choose it actually i never talk about it this in this chat but when i like to recolor uh us then that's what i choose because that's there and uh also i try to make it clean although there's like youtube uh window on the side which is you know playing the original video from the yeah you know what i was thinking also because i have to choose also some key images to share and then like can react like two tricky images and then i thought like uh like this image for instance sorry sorry sorry you shared the window and now i'm not seeing other things i mean you have to add zoom stuff like you have to share again or share the desktop i feel so much easier if you do it on live lab anyways can you not you cannot see this can you not now it's a whole desktop which is good okay yeah so in this case for instance i was thinking at some point like should i just uh crop this image right but because youtube was there and then at the same time i thought like but actually in a way this is part of the of what it was i mean it was taken at that point that was that was what's happening at that moment so in a way i think it's similar what happens in photography that if you ask to a photographer often and you will say it or i just said that last week to somebody who's making photography like and he's taking photographies of plants so i said like so you you you should have very nice images of plants right and the guy was saying like no because basically he was referring to that he just takes pictures of the moment right like that's kind of like the magic of the photography to kind of capture the moment so in that sense if we go back to that image like trying to clean and crop uh just the the nice aesthetically it will take away part of the moment which is the youtube screen that was there right uh but it's funny how to negot how to negotiate with that you know because you know somebody's asking you for a good image basically they were asking me select a good image that you would like to put almost like enough and i was thinking like this is good but i don't like that one and then i thought like yeah i just i just would meet the image like that because it represents the motion yeah yeah the moment right yeah um so that's that's why like i talked about the you know white background and try to make it clean um which is like on one hand it's like it feels like i'm like limiting myself with what i work with so that um i try to tidy up the desktop and try to make something nice that can you know lead to uh some limitations but at the same time on the other hand i think what's nice about it is it's it has i start to feel that i can really like make use of the space on the desktop um that because i consciously think about you know what's shown what's recorded the string on obs and then i really um even like in the the image you showed it's it doesn't look i mean i don't know like it's the right word but it doesn't look bad like it's it has some kind of confidence to be there as a like performative windows i don't know if you agree but that's that's how i i feel it what i what i noticed is like in the late the late in the last maybe two sessions you have been uh you make the you make almost like a clean canvas it's true that you're like it's more clean the canvas in the background yeah like it's more clean what happens when it's more clean so there are less things floating it's more clean yeah i don't know i just feel it but i'm thinking like is it good there is more cleaning in my head i'm thinking like what those are actually i'm thinking like those that bother me i was trying to think like those that but i don't think that does something but it also came from the idea that we talked about you know don't show the naked body i mean make it the camera thing and that start making me think you know what is shown there like not always light lab on the window and yeah yeah and that's that's why i mean not saying it's good or bad but yeah i think that that's something that like i think in my case because i have the tourists the three screens including my my laptop then i do yeah i basically i just jump between the scenes because the left one will have i get i guess all the clusters so like live lab and maybe sometimes hydra and then the right one will have sometimes just this main clean just one uh or is the main output of that i'm doing a bdmx mixed with the uh live lab somehow it's like a main composition that takes the whole screen and in the middle is the one that i will do different things like it's more like a control base uh yeah yeah yeah i was thinking because maybe i think in path i did it once i did that practice without the without the two screens i remember and then i have no chroma key we should do that soon also like i would like to see to do that again soon and also i want to try i wanted to propose as it is because of the in seats they have this this installation that we are building they found these massive projection screens for movie projection i guess they have like three big ones but they're big i don't know like very big and so at some point i think i will propose a practice and i want to see what happens uh just doing just my taking just my computer and just trying to project somehow to you to utilize that big projection and maybe what i will propose there is to actually if people want to come like to not maybe not make it as something special but if it's part of just one day that by chance i'm just start doing some stuff and um so i'm curious to see how that might go could be cool also maybe if we make it how to make something like that in the space because like so we both in the same space because basically the way who i imagine is that i have to basically move my laptop around a little bit so so then i would move in the space in different places you see it start doing something uh dancing and then maybe move somewhere else start doing the same and repeating the process because the space is very very big so i'm wondering how could be that uh like with you that could be interesting because the space is so big so then you're not so i guess sometimes you come together but uh i think the difference with node is like because we were in just in a limited space like we'll be we'll be cool in this space to see what happens because the space is like i don't know like 15 meters or maybe 20 meters in between it's like hide and seek it's like hide and seek and in the in the middle you have this massive installation also with all these things that they are completely from other contexts also that that will be interesting to see just yeah i think like the what i'm thinking of that is like i think that thinking too much or preparing too much to do something in that space it will be just the wrong approach because it's just it will just make things more complicated what they are yeah uh i think i think instead it should be more like on the spotsy do something and by chance ah by the way there is just this massive installation there so you know but this is this is something really like i think i always think about it you know like making ad hoc and try to be fluid with what you have um but i think these days i'm getting way better at this like for example yesterday um so what happened was uh so i had this seminar week last week and on friday it was finished and some equipments were like already packed and um but some are like left on site i mean in the storage and on sunday we had to show something because people from the city were visiting so we had to like show whatever we have there but some because some things are missing and not everyone's there um we had a projector we had some dmx lights but we didn't have computer and uh what else we were missing uh we didn't have internet connection and i totally didn't know that uh people were visiting so i ran to came back home and took my tablet computer which is not really great but with every adapter i can bring with hdmi to actually hdmi cable as well because i later i noticed that they only had display port but i mean hdmi connector but no hdmi cable so it's good that i brought the cable and i didn't have internet connection so i couldn't open hydra so i opened obs and uh you know like obs you can add some filters like color filters and stuff and you can do that chroma key or luma key so i set up lubaki and crop people because the background was uh it's like outside and the background is super bright but we're in a kind of arch for tunnel so we were really dark so we did like i did luvaki to to cut to the bright part and the bottom layer is the screen capture so you can do feedback loop just with obs and i added like color like slightly shifted the feedback so it started like become like a height or a kind of feedback loop but how do you do the feedback like through uh through the camera through analog camera or no just obs so i have my image okay i can actually try it uh if i can do it that will be really cool uh but that was that was really nice because i just did whatever i could do and not relying on not panicking that i cannot do this or that because of the limitation okay so how do i do it so right now i switch to obs virtual camera and then i do luma key with the color key or other key yeah so you can crop the background like this you will take away the brightness yeah i mean it's not perfect but you know that's what it is and then you do uh let's say display capture maybe and then you display it at the back yeah you just have to change the layers and then look myself no [Music] and then yeah like this well like it's it's just like where we how we started actually yeah yeah because we yeah at the beginning we like the first session with ah actually so it's just you it's just a screen record the screen recording the uh your image the position of your yeah yeah it's a screen recording yeah and then actually like what uh i want to make it a bit bigger and like at last i just add like a color filters to the feedback like effect color correction and then hue shift so something like this up and then there is a hue there is shifting every second or every certain time there is some color there is yeah i just because i added hue shift to the the screen capture so it's capturing it again every time yeah yeah it's so simple like i can boost saturation as well cool and you know people are impressed although i just set up obs yeah yep i think it's interesting that how to [Music] yeah bypass the the the tool itself not like if it's not working hydra live lab the internet so then how to do something similar from the tools that we have right it's really loud um yeah and it's actually looks very different from hydra because i think because of the resolution and hydra's resolution is somehow not so good and wait i can add sharpening filter which makes the how do you say it like reaction diffusion kind of effect sometimes anyways but i think it's going to slow down a bit so turn it off yeah and people wouldn't notice what is hydra and what is obs so yeah right that is good very cool super nice thanks okay i'm back with webcam yeah i i was reflecting a bit on [Music] because i have been working with seats these days and then it's a collectible it's it's more community based artwork and i think we mentioned this the last time um yeah when we talk while i was there in the house is that it's interesting how because there's so much people there's so much things going on then i cannot worry about how something would look like or trying to really uh yeah concern about the final aesthetic of something because there is so much people and other things they are involved in the whole process then just that process of being there with the people um generates something different um that i don't know if from an aesthetical point of view than work or not work as a piece of art but nevertheless as a framework to possibility things and interactions with people in terms of collective creation works and yeah i was thinking about it that like because then then i think you know as as an artist then i will be very i could be very harsh thinking this is art this is not art if i will working with myself or in the framework but if i will be working with more people then i i mean i can't still keep on doing those things but since i'm not alone that they're not so uh it's not the most important thing because the most important thing is being with other people and trying to create something together yeah i mean actually yeah i didn't really expect my experience for the last week's seminar to be like that but so i was not really making my own work which i often say in this world by my own work but whatever that means um because i don't know if it's my best practices my own work no uh yes and no i guess but what i mean you're one of the best ones you're one of the best ones how did i write it on my web page website like something like you know the most important figure one of the best exponents in the field of best practice and contemporary dance yeah is one of the most important figures in the field of the best practice in contemporary dance as and has been taking crucial role in the best practices chat since 2020 uh so what i would say is i was just like you know um just you know be there and just chilling uh sometimes if anyone needs help to you know set up something with a ladder i can hold the ladder or if someone needs to set up um like video mapping i can also help and i was not really like you know doing something on my own except one thing that i did which is um this ring but but i think that's that was also fun because you know if you are like just working on your work then it's really hard to you know to do something together like some sometimes you need someone who's just you know floating and like connecting things and this is what i did um did i send you the photo no maybe not i don't think so yeah so this is my work and uh one of the visitors really like this not not just this but me holding this because i was just standing like this during the like the showing i was just like doing this on the street because the venue was like facing the street so i was on the sidewalk and like just holding this um and one of the visitors really liked it i really want her to come to the chat because she's really interesting person uh she does like makeup she's like makeup artist and uh she wants to do makeup on me and wear a dress holding that next to uh brothel that's close right now but you know like just to be a model as a prostitute and she wants to do a photo shoot so that might happen and uh anyways like this you know these random things happened which was really nice if i had like a plan to you know do some video mapping on my own and do something you know then that wouldn't have happened no yeah i think like there is we speak of the in the practice of how we propose in a way this way of like do minimal interesting art that lingers just right in the middle between exciting and forgetting uh and i think that's it's just by the way that was up because i just brought it to us in my head okay forget about it so of course they have like few of those like but we propose this idea like just say like that is minimal interesting and it just lingers right there in the middle between forgetting and exciting and it's just so it's it's just something that if it's too special it lost it becomes something different it becomes something that is more uh back to i mean or more back to this idea of art being something very special and for elites and if you want to go even back just for rich people or just for an elite of people that can enjoy or can even pay art um when it's too special so it just excludes other ones who are enjoying the art but at the other spectrum you have also something that is just anything and it still has to linger in the in between it has to be especially enough to be an art artifact it cannot just be anything um and that's just something that i think uh doing that kind of process by one alone is just different i think it's more difficult because you will be constantly trying to understanding what are you in that in that balance are you more on this side or aren't you more on that side but when you are with more people basically you are just insisting something that as a framework you believe is interesting as an art piece but many times are just random ideas and sometimes more more uh interesting ideas and yeah so i think this this is something there is is in in that spectrum of what you were speaking when you work with other people and i think that's very interesting for us to think in the future also when we think to uh sandbox and to try to more invite more people to to join and play with the foreign for example yes yeah true true yeah because i think like in it uh just add to what you said about you know being something special as art whatever it is uh it also makes us vulnerable because people judge if it's an art or if it's a good art or bad art and that's really hard sometimes often and it's good when we can somehow go around that judgment then it feels free but it's but how how do we circumvent that argument i mean we do it well i think like like what i'm thinking is that because yeah i'm thinking that one thing that i believe is that as an artist for to you need to insist and almost be obsessed about uh doing something because you need to if you want to develop a language so you need to just insist in in things that you believe are true and just start building a language right uh so in that sense i think you need to be you need time to be on yourself and then just doing this process but on the other hand also i think so this is just individually just i think one myself i'm thinking how i think it's easy to to develop a language to create a new language but if i will go uh uh behind a more as a critical or as a critique then i will also i think it's easy to judge a work when is made just for one person because in a way i will start already assuming things of the person i will judge easily a piece of work of somebody because it's just done by one person rather than when if i'm seeing a piece of work there is the result of a framework of more people working together i uh i might not judge so easy because because because it's just because it's not one person um but i think it depends you know if it's like i'm trying to think um but if they have like really specific framework for example if there are animation students and then they like video mapping with the same format and they somehow contribute everyone contributed to work then it's like kind of easy to judge because i mean okay it's not really done by as a collective they prepared individually and show it together as a work then yeah it's it's not doesn't align with what you said but um but i think i don't know if i understand the way how i see what you're saying that i i partially agree is that if there is a framework of students coming from a animation school and they're working in certain frameworks i think might be easy to judge even the framework if the framework is well defined let's say if it's close to crafting then one can have tools to actually criticize the craft or not right right because this is not saying yeah rather than when it is something that is proposed as an artistic framework then i will be more harsh on that or dance let's see something something that comes with the skill yeah yeah something that comes more for something yeah that comes comes more for the skill the technique the tool itself the mastering of the tool itself the body being the dance or the computer and after effects in animation or something like that but it was it's because how you said it makes total sense but at the same time i feel the project you're working on like with the seeds or how i intervened the other students in the seminar is not typical that how you would work as a collector or a maybe it is i don't know but um but this will be at the same time sorry yes yeah go ahead because we you know are let's say experienced and do it easily in a way but it's not always the case no but it's interesting what you're saying because like in my process with seeds for instance like this is kind of the contradiction that i was trying to explain because in one hand i at this point in my life i believe that this is actually an artist should take its time to develop its own language and go in that direction because otherwise it will just be generic uh but at the same time uh then so yeah so at the same time if i so then if i go my myself in seats and start building then i will start going really fast ahead of something that made you know i will start going okay this looks like this maybe if we keep on doing this in two weeks it will just look horrible or it just makes it make no sense i will start all doing those all those judgments based on my thinking in regards to art um but then within the framework then just you realize actually without somebody telling you actually because you're not communicating this but without somebody telling you then you actually you are with yourself like ow you know what actually i mean you kind of like slow down the you put down the sword basically you put down the sword and you are more okay maybe this is just something different and it's still valid as an art because not only as a place to come together and just have fun but as a real piece of art that stand by for itself but then there has to be a lot of trust basically and then we go back to all this that we have talked at the beginning that just be the space has to for uh provide a safe space to not care about the other ones so in other words also to care that because i don't care what you're doing then i just start doing my thing and at some point then just become together and then we see how to blend this thing which happens in what we do uh and happens in the in those frameworks if people just get busy with their stuff and then sometimes it just comes and maybe they slow down and maybe they need to rationalize this process how do we put these two things together but if they start doing this all the time they just don't go nowhere right even if you start tedious because yeah you cannot imagine if like if you if you if we need to start explaining to each other what are we doing that's just i mean that in itself could be something different and we should try it but but i i get your point for example like let's say if we are aiming for something for example like uh not a performance but let's say we have a talk well that's still possible but in your case you have an exhibition so you have to make something at the end whatever it is right so you have to show something and if you yeah i i understand if you come back to this uh yeah slow down too much then nothing is going to happen which but yeah nothing is going to happen sometimes it's true like you know people just like to talk about things and just like nothing's getting done but it's i mean it's hard yeah yes it's like what you're talking just is like because as much as right one this like solo art is going for as much as valid is as much as the other one is valid uh and both so it's just a trying to have an absolute truth like who has who is like having like this egg alien through like this this absolute truth is just impossible i mean also a part of being impossible it just makes no sense trying to aim for who is right right yeah yeah um i just i thought about something uh when you said hey like about working together um i also noticed like when i work with someone or like when i work alone then things are super fast like you said and but at the same time like what i make is not so interesting and i started to think that it's probably not really relatable to people because it makes sense in within myself but it's not something that people get it and if i work with someone it might slow down like with for example when i work with you then i show what i'm making and you know if it's too fast and if i'm just you know it's okay if we do things separately or individually but if it starts to you know not transparent because i do something that you don't understand for example and it's just yeah it's just wrong um that's one thing and also like for example i'm i did some like experiments with floor and what we do is actually like i already did in the past with the sound light coding sound and you know doing some 3d spatialization of sound and stuff but and i actually used it in the performance last year but i felt it was something was missing um that people don't really get it but the technical part is there and now i'm just like looking at those things i did in the last during last year and show her you know what this you can do it this way that way but it's that's it's makes much more i don't know why it sends uh much more sense when i work with someone because i have to explain maybe i don't know i don't know i mean the way who i relate this i think this is part of the chats when we talk at some point about this we make the analogy of the windows player being the the the gallery director who went to holidays and never came back internet explorer 6 or something yes so basically but this idea was just that it just through because in our case for in the case what we do is that we bypass all the the the heaviness of the politics saying that like the finding meaning like the ontological process of of the doing so as you said if i'm working alone then i might fast get into something that it has shape right from a tool based point of view and it's formally good but i might get stuck fast because i need to do i need to start doing conceptual processes like oh i'm dealing with my own identities politics like rationing like thinking is good bad good bad but when i'm in a process with you then i don't have time to do this process i need to just so yeah in a way it's like your presence there you just bypass the politics and the complexity of that that's the way i perceive this and i make the analogy because in different ways i think that's a concern that i find in the practice or as a strategy that can be utilized in other contexts like how to find ways to bypass politics or when you get stuck in somewhere how to bypass that so uh yeah if i write a letter to you then not to you but then to the space or like how to find uh the artifact that is just so not to to uh avoid the problem because the problem is there to do something for it but then how to find an artifact an excuse the internet explorer six or whatever is to bypass and not deal with the consequences of doing right or wrong it's i don't know is it something speculative or it's i don't know what is this condition or the space or [Music] i think it's 100 i mean if we talking or if we talking in our practice i think it's 100 or very much speculative because then we don't know exactly how we look but we know what are we doing uh yes so yeah it's like we don't know actually the shape or like the final something but we know but we are busy you know and it's normally what we are busy that sometimes just and we do this process like the last session you ask me everything is okay like and we find all these little uh nuances in the practice it's just a lot about the communication and how we find ways to basically yeah to address something yeah but maybe just going back to what you're saying in the the core i think is very speculative but speculative in the sense of like proposing a new world of this post-human uh so something that is not yet imaginable um yeah what's the what's this thing that uh uh what like a board with like alphabet and like a few people put the you know finger together and find the next like we had we had table like when they called the spirit yeah i i felt it's a little bit like that because uh it doesn't work alone right but you need some people and then something happens and that's actually a very good that's a very good analogy because in a way if we that's a very good analogy because if what we are saying in the practice is like we are trying to aim for self-dissociation and so distantiation from this persona that i'm here right now with my consciousness then in a way then i'm trying to call spirits to come like whether it's aristotle's will user like to to call the tarzis to come and all the muses to take me and to a different place and it's very similar to the it's i think it's a really good analogy because the that we have they're going together somewhere and calling the spirits which is dangerous right because at the same time you're playing with fire because you're playing with fire at the same time yeah i i think my mother always told me you never play that because because it's very exciting don't do that yeah you know interesting okay um [Music] i was just thinking like if if anyone did that with like a web interface it should be possible right you just use the mouse and you know if someone connects together and somehow it'll move the mouse together yes and won't be nice at the same time we should do that like we should do that like we should start thinking the best practice in web design like proposed because that might be interesting let's say say that if you go to a page it's completely black or there is very little something and then just when somebody join and then just magnetically goes there and from what you're moving somehow you're revealing parts of something something that is behind and then you're revealing these parts that might be interesting to go in into that narrative because that's a narrative if that image there's a narrative it's just an hour there is a long then another arrow comes and this universe there is void is slowly something start to reveal when they travel to the universe you see um like for example i'm i think i showed you some of the things but uh i'm trying with like kind of what i call generative dialogue on like or interactive uh documentation whatever um basically it's not like article with text and images but uh i take chunks of like a small like one line of sentence or it can be a paragraph with image or it can be a video and every part has a hashtag to it and i start with like one uh piece of text and then you can click on the one of the hashtags and then that will reveal uh another chunk of text or image that has the same hashtag and you can like kind of navigate through so it's not linear or like it's always different because there's randomness or like which option you choose will change the text so that's that's something i've been working on um it could be it sounds very much it sounds very much like this it's called the phd or like like the link that i shared that diana shared with me or like this phd because they're so complicated with documents they're just a document with links and links and links and links and there is just no linearity and just you go through i mean just you go into this into the space and and it's very similar to don't hashtag with hyperlinks yeah it's actually interesting because that looks like you know it's not a thesis but it's like a encyclopedia yeah yeah it's just you can spend i think i i i i guess you can spend endless hours it's like the louvre of the website is like a louis vuitton website the museum louvre of our website is just endless and it's very interesting content there that you can just get lost and i mean what i think is cool is this idea it's kind of like the the the the internet in itself you know like they when you just get lost how you call that when you get lost in clicking there is a word for that but basically just yeah just you start going for i don't know i want to buy a net our net art book by the way i want to buy a net art book so a good one that's what you did you know you let me know uh but it's just like and then i start clicking and clicking and clicking and clicking like two hours after and maybe i'm watching a cartoon about the russian spy yeah but yeah that so that would be interesting to somehow uh well it's it can be connected to the mouse idea or can be something separate but that's in like something that interests me as a best practices in web design especially because i think that's getting more rare because of the social media because you know in social media you just say contained in their space that you don't really go outside i mean you can but they try to you know make a wall around you some of the things that i have been thinking while i was writing this uh this thesis is of course i have to revive different things and then i went to images and some of the images of course because they are just screenshots are so badly pixelated that just because they are so bad they reveal different things from the image because there is just yeah so i cannot i did know that in purpose we do not on purpose but once i'm trying to put that in indesign or something there is just some uh like physical tray of just bad printing or something the resolution and i'm mentioning that in regards to the arrow and the hyperlink and thinking of the website and and best practice in web design is uh the idea of revealing uh because basically when you click this hyperlink it's basically let's try to open gates right um but what if you never left the space you know what if you are not completely transported to the next space so imagine that you're clicking something but you're not completely it's kind of like i imagine some kind of like a feedback you do you see what i mean like the one that you were just trying today that in a way you never left the space but the windows were going so in a way if the click is actually is opening the gate but you're never leaving that might be something interesting that is just like revealing uh yeah i think it's just interesting this idea of revealing but not binary in the sense like now you are there yeah this idea also like i had and um one of the things i tried so you know like if you use hydra editor you have the code in the url like with uh you know this is a question mark that you can add questions these parameters can id query or something yeah it should be a query html and i was thinking like um it cannot be with other people's page but if i'm i decide on some kind of you know simple protocol that if you visit one page and uh if you don't have anything uh like this query uh then you add that on like that webpage will add that query and let's say that's the hydra code so the page will show the hydra texture on the background and then if you go to another link in that page maybe to different website that i made then it will continue using the same code so the from where you visited the webpage it will show different textures i mean yeah so that's that's something i was thinking although yeah i kind of didn't really do it much because um i mean i have the code already and uh but yeah the question is like why and also it makes more sense if more people uh participate in a way like i call it like web ring and i also wanted the red ring again but yeah it needs people to participate to make it more interesting if it's just i mean we can do it together also um but yeah what happens if you know 10 people 100 people will do it and then it becomes like a real network yeah i think we'll be lagging that i think would be nice like a gathering where you imagine that you go to like you're trying to go to chrome or searching for something and then in a way you are not really leaving the space somehow you cannot reach what you're searching for so then in a way then so you're not succeeding in using chrome too as a tool uh but what happens if there are many people at the same time sharing the same space um yeah i'm just wondering if it is that because the i guess what it comes to my head at first is there should be desperation you know like to be very annoying if you're trying to open something and you cannot do it but what happens if if you actually consciously you go to the space to share uncertainty in in the space and then many people go to the same space to do the same process like imagine you go to like imagine you go to the bank and then you you go to pay something that is yourself it's a big line and you have to wait and then so your objective to go to the bank is to pay something but because you have to wait then you start talking maybe you met your wife that day or something like that happens so something around that idea that that in that scenario the scenario of the chrome then is how to find ways to for the people to communicate and exchange something that at some point like that if you think the example of the arrow with olivia was like arrows doing something but yeah some some way how people can interact and share this uncertainty or this uselessness i would say this better time agency yeah yeah it's funny because the bank you said um because how we met is something like that it's it's more specific but we never said you know i'm looking for someone to work for years or something and then sometimes people were passing and they were hey hello bye-bye but it was straight that was true yeah that was like the bank waiting in the bank that's true bank that never opens but yeah i think it's nice we can keep it up in the air and think about it sometimes you know what is the browser that gives that kind of quality or a browser or web page that would be nice and i think it's yeah i don't know i wouldn't say too much about it because it's nice as an idea and you know it's it needs some time to yeah yeah yeah also also i think that that could be like bringing that down to a more practical term could be just like if we find a way like to to sandbox what we do in a workshop or something that would be very nice i think that would be a good way to start inviting other people and just to to see what other people will do actually yeah i think it's very you know something that i've seen in the process that i'm doing now with these people in seats is that i i see like for reason uh angelo is this the let's say the most visible uh part of the project and the most recognizable artist there and stuff and then i'm wondering also how because sometimes he needs to come and say like i wouldn't i would do it differently he said literally that like if you're working in something so he's not doing that all the time but sometimes he comes and says like i'll do it differently i will do this or this so he's not saying do this but then then you will do it or not that's up to you and then i'm just wondering putting that in the context like like how would be we have a state like a sandbox and then we buy somebody else and then we are just kind of like happy and this third person start just just ramping up i mean just doing things that we are not expecting and we're bored like i'm really curious to see like what is happening but but no but no no way stop we start again this is not like this because because we cannot do it it's like the is that we have basically no it's like that we have table then just you open and you don't know might be super nice but it might be a completely just satan calms in and then just it takes you to the to the artist and it will be very cool like it would be very nice to to see what happens with other people how to deal basically i'm seeing more trying to see more in the future this i think is more the concern how to deal with myself basically i'm not concerned with the person but i'm concerned more with my mental health i think it's more with me like how to deal with myself in that scenario like well when you say that say a third person you know commenting on it and not just commenting but you know like making suggestions or whatever is that something that you would hear during the practice or it's separate it will be i don't know i think that's the that's the curious thing not that because i i mean this is things that we can't talk but it's just this is part of the things that i write that is clear to me that this is funny because it seems like repeating like the conclusions of my of my of my thesis but is that one of the difficult thing parts of like writing that is like to we talk of this when you give me some feedback it's like how to how to text base something that is just fully grasp where you are actually in the space with it like how you can text-based something that is not that's not the medium for let's say the practice is just the practice and it touches different things so it's not a cognitive rational process is a negotiation between uh and but like an embodied uh cognitive process and a rational cognitive process it's a negotiation between the two of these um so yeah and then trying to text base something that is embodied but not only embodied but it's in conversation so meaning that you should have agency still to think about it right and and just do the rational cognitive process so putting that to a text base it gives an essence or try it will try to do the the best the text can to say what is but it cannot be fully grasped by by reading by by writing that because it's as it is in dance it has the moment uh embodied presence you need to be in the space you need to experience the thing so i'm saying that in regards to what you're talking of the just only when somebody comes then we will see like i see no but it's that's really interesting um i feel we should wrap up soon but um but i i think we have enough things you see my pigeon wait you see there is a pigeon [Music] okay hello maybe they want to join the practice that was a nice shot great so we have a guest this time our writers um yeah uh yeah i put like links in our shared document but and so again i've been you know kind of researching uh brutal and i am they have this thing uh brutal notation which i feel it's such a weird notation what is that about i never heard of that before yeah i mean either it's so strange that they say they named it notation because i think in japanese it's more like a brutal score but basically it's like a a bunch of words and like kind of instructions but they're often really abstract poetic that it's hard to grasp like you know it's not that you move this way but you know to become like you know pollen in the air or something like that um right and basically the the founder of how he taught students was using those texts like that he named each movement with these descriptions and that's that's how he taught dance and the some students like well they took notes and some of them actually like published it later and one of them is actually uh they published uh into a website which is super nice i mean it's too clean for um for me uh for my taste but it's like really nicely done and you can click on some words it's like a wikipedia like wiki of the brutal notation so you can go to like related terms you can see images um which is really nice because it's not something that they added later but it came from the practice itself so that it's like the the text is embodied in a way and that's something i think could be really interesting for us to think about so that it's not that always coming the text coming afterwards to describe something but the text well that's kind of we tried trying already but to to have it in the practice to really capture the moment it doesn't capture the moment but maybe the body captures the text i don't know yeah but i think i partly disagree with what you're saying in the because i was checking for instance what we did the last time and i you did something that i think i was doing often when i when i work with text is that you basically at some point you put some music and then you were dancing and then you come back and i just you choose some of the words this is what you came for or something that was the song that he was playing there and in my text in my in my in my thesis then i i i make a uh an analysis between this uh there's my embers my birth of nanji peg in relation to how they approach time through post-production and i i will say that they know that we bend time uh so not to post production but within an archiving videos and so not post production but in a different way so then you're just using archiving let's say not editing videos so that's one thing but the other thing that i wanted to say is about the text because in that video use the use is this a dance question mark when the taxes are passing and then i will argue that that in the practice the text is it comes from an embodied experience and it can only happens at the moment uh because it's actually is there it doesn't really have an a clear intention in the doing uh is is not pre thought it's just something that rises up in the at the moment and i will argue that what they were doing in the video is like there is a conscious uh choosing of the images and the text in order to evoke something for the view right and yeah so that's what i was i wanted to say like the yeah in that regard with the text that i said i use the hashtag the text is not static and that's what you put it in in the last in the last performance your text is not a static and it just evolves as it yeah well yeah let's let's close here but uh but i'm still really interested in like this uh hijikata's approach because yes what i understand is he constantly changes the choreography like even if like like just before the the show or like after one uh performance he will change something and that's i think something is there about him that was like he was trying to um so there's something fluid but i don't know uh that's what i read and i don't exactly well there it is impossible to to know what he was thinking but it's something that i'm i'm interested but well i think this is what you're saying maybe like before we close this i think it's very interesting because what you were saying that i i was trying to imagine in other contexts in dance when you use some some words and and i think it's so interesting and i also make the the differentiation from the way who i perceive how we use the text that is really random actually um and in this case again the way how you describe it that i haven't seen it but it just it seems to me that is through words that open gates that in a way so then open a gate and not that gate if you say that like through this movement like you move like i don't know like the sun or you feel something like the sun then it opens again it's not telling you exactly what is it but from that gate you go somewhere else and from there you go somewhere else so in a ways like is going somewhere together so it's not random but is going so it keeps on opening gates that it are consequently uh yeah so they are they are consequent of the previous one without the need to be rational in the thinking because it goes through the embodied experience nevertheless it goes in a nicely way it has to be organic like in that process the way i see it it must be organic and i think it's very interesting like because it still is like it's using cognitive process but to open gates yeah cognitive to possibly yeah yeah that's the closing board so please uh like the video and subscribe to the channel and thanks for the guest vision but thanks for the guest pj we love you okay see you next time", "Ecne2NxF5vw": "okay now it's recording and welcome back to the live stream i guess okay or is it my sound not working again hello can you hear me okay i think i messed up again uh let me just check i saw some point three windows so i don't know if floor is here yeah she is coming so we have a guest today okay what's let's wait hello everyone welcome to the chat this is the grand finale part of the day this is the third and last part of this structure or the choreography that we propose as a structure of the practice yeah which has development and the practice and the chat so we are in the chat and today we have i guess um and she's in the lobby she's making she's preparing herself and she will be joined very soon yes hey this this thing was very very interesting oh hello hi hello how are you hi flor nice to meet you morning invitation yeah the connection is bad so maybe everyone can uh how you do it like in options there's three dots you go to manage video quality and okay maybe set it to like low definition or something i put it in low recognition now yeah let's see if this helps i'm still looking for it because my cheat sits in spanish oh what should be we share settings where did you said it was now auto manage i manage uh call quality right yeah so it's the first is the first option you have after you oh i found it uh low quality yes you agree in being cheap hopefully it's gonna work so maybe so maybe now auto can introduce a little bit uh slower no we didn't give introduction last time for joanna so we just started like this i can make an interaction for for you great no no no i just i was just joking too bad but uh youtube like it's the first time you speak the first time that we talk like we react sometimes social media but we never talk yes but i feel like i i already know you maybe because i i saw you in best practices so you're really familiar to me yeah we are part of the family somehow right yes it seems like that yes yeah so uh how do we start what what happened today um or would we start differently how are you where are you where are you now i mean la plata buenos aires argentina yes it's getting cold but today it's really sunny and i have a neighbor her name is juanita and she's almost uh 100 years and she's uh listening music really loud like i don't know if it's just maybe and it was really funny because uh i was at the living room and suddenly music really loud started to sound and i have a roommate and my roommate thought it was me and i thought it was her but it was my neighbor from above and and we go we say she's a dj because she's always listening to music good your neighbor yeah maybe if i open the window you could listen but i'm gonna mute a second because the window will sound really loud oh it's not it's not there anymore maybe because in fact it's she's above but uh it's on the other side also and the music is louder on the other side i see but i can hear a piano and i just can't imagine her like playing on the living room for a while she's not dancing i don't know maybe on friday because she was listening to 80s music and pop music maybe we should invite her for a chat sometime or as a dj yes vijay will be interesting character yes you should she uh really smart i don't know if she speaks english but there was somebody who come could contact me from uh we are doing an art installation with a collective of artists uh in bridge in belgium and it's a collective that is called seeds it stands for space ecology art and design i think and then there was one person so that we have been working for one year doing an installation like virtually and now we are coming together to really build the installation and there was one person in the network because a big network they contact me through the discord and he want to join because we have in discord one random channel so then i put there uh the best practices session and i guess he was watching that today because he sent a message yeah today he sent a message today like oh i was watching i would like uh to join you guys if possible in one of the chats and i don't know who is this person so dan is i know his name is dan uh so you're very welcome to in the near future join us we'll be very happy to have you i was just thinking like maybe we should like um invite random people like two or three people and we don't show up [Laughter] yeah belicho yes so i don't know if you have a chance today to to to watch upbeat or for some times that the what we did today i don't know if you if you could watch something today oh no i i just turned on my computer okay but you've seen in the past so yes that's that's that's good enough i think yes i think that's that's more than enough i don't think we are doing new stuff that's something you know it's a big i don't think they're doing new stuff now um so yeah part of this idea of coming to to come together i want to invite somebody else is to we try to introduce this idea instead of like q and q and a like questions and answers we try to see it more as a q and o more like questions and options when we are not really answering something but we are just trying to figure out together what is that that we that we are doing or the oh the we as three right now are uh share us interest like in common interest um yeah maybe you can talk about the post-human idea that we talked we we have been like interested in wasn't human because we're not post-human yet or i don't know uh that could be interesting yeah what what is the most human for you for me oh i don't know i have like uh contradictions about it i mean because i see two two ways of being both human like uh thinking in a way as a maybe a perspective more related i don't know if you know donna haraway yeah yeah like a boss human that goes beyond the usage of body but because of this this human understood that we are not maybe the anthropocene [Music] that we are not better than i don't know maybe nature or animals or technology or and so this post human looks for something that goes beyond but can mix and in a way add these ideas or or or i don't know how to say but mix the word with itself and can you repeat the last thing that you said the movie that moved something that moves beyond the oneself that's what he said yes sorry i don't understand the question no no because i didn't underst i didn't uh understood but you couldn't follow the laws okay uh now you don't have to say it it was just i i think i didn't there was a lack in the internet oh okay okay i can speak slower and on the other hand i see a post human that goes beyond or tries to break through humanity in a way to be be better but in a capitalist way so that's that that's the second post human that you're saying okay yes yes and and i see this this is related to the advance of technology and and the the i don't know uh let me think because i'm thinking in english and in spanish and it's hard but or maybe you can sing in spanish you could because at least one you can understand you two can understand yeah yeah for sure in spanish [Laughter] just tell me in spanish and we don't tell you yeah and i just if i'm so frustrated i just say put up and that's it you're going to be banned of youtube that's part of like inside conversation that we have at some point is because it happens to me sometimes i get frustrated so i will have to say que puta in spanish and come really deep from inside and then that was really in the early in the process then naoto was saying during please don't say that it was gay like of course with really too much uh for him okay um i can think maybe in spanish i i will say i think is [Music] but an improvement then in a way okay if i understood you well then it has this second plus human i think she's seen more as something that in a way we we touch these topics as as as an improvement you know this human that it has to go forward to improve itself and become something better in reverse yeah something better just saying that something better i think is it it says a lot yeah i completely agree with you in that sense and so you do live coding a lot i mean that's that's what you do all day but uh like how do you think about post-human when your life code okay well i think it has to do with a decision i made in 2014 when i started to work with digital image but i used to just start drawing and [Music] using photoshop and illustrator at that moment but i think uh i when i started to use this digital media i started drawing like in a really traditional way and and then i at that moment i read uh marshall [Music] the media or yes yes yes yes the bible for me oh that's great i love him um and and then i started to notice that i was like uh really involved with the usage of social media and the computer and every day i use it more and more and so i i started to just research what i could do because i started to have the the feeling that that i was really like getting involved with technology and and so i could not avoid this and well one one thing uh to another then made me start doing like coding and and every day it's more maybe i would like to maybe we can go back and i would like to know what is your interpretation of uh of my holland um because i have an interpretation on what i do so i'm very curious to know how you see i mean how you see that and how you interpret what he's saying okay um well one one thing i i really believe is that the computer will be an extension of my body so i i think that technology maybe use it in a conscious way could could be maybe thinking in this false human donna haraway's perspective could be related to to this idea of well yeah technology is an extension of our bodies and and also i i don't i'm not sure if he says this but i see that technology influence culture and culture influence technology like uh uh up no no uh go and like well done i don't know i don't know that thing will be like upcycling or something like that um so yes it's really interesting that like in our modern life i think like technology is everywhere it's really stupid to say it that way but it sounds like you're trying to like really draw the line between you know where what you are as a human and then the technology has extension which means it's not part of yourself but it's something that's there and you have the constant negotiation between yourself as a human and the technology as another entity well mcluhan says that is i mean he doesn't talk about computer but he talks about technology because i think he only reached to to talk about television but um he refers to this as the idea of a protesters ayah something about magnolia repeat again okay i was saying that mark lujan says that technology maybe could be a processes oh really i think what i found very interesting is he mentioned a lot of these things about like culture and actually he speaks a lot about the message so the content and the the reach in a way yeah he's kind of he's very conscious of this so the way how i was just taking that was more into just down to me don't doubt my opinion what are basically the things that i use you know so for instance if at the beginning in the research within autumn i was using uh because i wanted to learn and i wanted to just like i have some projectors and smoke machines and i have this beautiful place in france with a chapel so i could just take my machines and that was the way how we started working i was just projecting to the chapel with the smoke machines analog tvs lasers different kind of things good conditions to do these things and i was just like in summer so for me was just testing but at some point in in time then we realized that it was not necessary for the message i mean for the contents uh well you can already see it but there's a huge space yeah anyways everything has a feature by heart but of course you can create this amazing and willing uh immediately you know projecting it into a chapel and stuff [Music] but yeah in a way i think it was in the early stage so i think what i'm trying to say in regards to what uh what we're talking is that i find out that if my question at some point was how much uh digital quality of uh technical technical complexity or storytelling do i need to use to convey a message uh because that was kind of a problem when i started like being conscious of what i was doing then i started thinking and it was actually more when i started reading this book because it i just read it yeah during the process and then because of that then i started thinking actually it's just my medium but my the things that i have it will just create the content that i have to put and then i just have to get rid of things that i don't need i don't need i don't even need some things that maybe they come back at some point that at this moment for the medium that i have they were not necessary to try to convey a message so the content was defined beforehand i think it's interesting this idea of that i think the content that we are creating in the practice is created beforehand i think given the constraints if if i if i make some some sort of sense with that uh does that make any sense with this yes yes absolutely uh yes i i kind of uh feel and believe the same uh maybe sometimes you you need uh like um complex technology but sometimes not because you are the i i just can't think about books and i don't know but i'm thinking about i don't know if you know there is meat no well there is meat it's an art curator and i guess he's i don't know if he's philosopher but uh he talks about uh contemporary art and and then he says you have this concept of spectacular or spectacularity in art and and then he says that you you go to to to see a an experience that has a lot of complexity or and and maybe you um well you have fun but then it's kind of empty of ideas and and concept right yeah so um i i was thinking about him when when when you were saying uh these these things um and and yes i i really feel the same i i really try to think uh what i'm doing on my practices i try to to write and and to think and to read and to get inspired not only because uh something it's uh complex in a technology way i mean it's it's not only about code i always say in my workshops or if i uh give a talk that you could do something really cool in just one line of code and [Music] it's okay it's it doesn't matter yeah i mean i think it like um there is this idea of that we we talk about often in in in the practice with naoto is this idea that in a way like the in somehow i i propose this idea to know to that that a thing like it's something that something that yeah like a thing is so is something that is kind of floating and it's not it's nothing it's just a thing right but once you pull it down you have to put it in regard to something for instance if i will said i don't uh i don't if i'm speaking in english and i don't know how to call a packet of cigarettes i will tell you my you pass me a thing so then the package of cigarettes becomes the thing so the abstraction become the thing uh but the cigarettes already was so before the cigarettes became the thing it was uh how to try to how to say this it's like it's like the thing in a pure state is nothing it's just a thing and it's pure but once you pull it down from this abstraction it becomes it loses the its pure state and becomes corrupts into the world and becomes just what we what we wanted to do uh um that at the end is binary i think cannot stay uh empty of knowledge of interpretation in the world it has to be with the name then you know it so many things are attached it is language that you know i learned in english or even if i say it in japanese or if you say in spanish um but this actually i don't know maybe you wanted to continue something but today there was this moment there was this moment that you wanted to say something but you didn't know what to how to describe it in the practice that was the thing that was the thing i don't know but actually that's not true because you know what you will try to do but to say it in spanish actually that's interesting that the the lab the there is a glitch i think that glitch is what is super cool because you know what you want to say in spanish but you're speaking in english so the just the lapses between trying to convey the message so the medium it that's the glitch and that's something that just that's a thing that's something that is it's just not doesn't have a form yet nevertheless it has a form so it's not anything is something that it has potentiality it is potential it has a lot of potential to be an idea to be an art piece it's just not anything it's something i have a question do you think uh language it's a technology then i think language is a tool i think then uh i think the language is a tool i think languages might be a technology i mean i understand then the technology the tech the tool as as a function something that is either does or not better or wrong so then it's a tool and there are better tools but then the technology will be a compile of tools that actually they might give a possibility for new things to happen so a tool has a function but the technology doesn't doesn't necessarily need to have one function it's just a compile of tools that normally will suggest other things to happen by themselves so i think in the example that you were saying before with actually just through technologies the other technologies happen like like photography is based on something before and something before and something before that's hard uh i was trying to think about the floor's question and so i give another option about it no because with the language i would say well i don't know if it's technology or not but i was thinking about the the mdn reference the javascript reference where we often go and check what the function means because you know it's like a dictionary for programming language right in javascript but then the customer in javascript yeah but the funny thing is that if if you write javascript it has to follow the grammar even if you use hydra and go crazy you have to still make a you know sensible like something that makes sense but with the language we often just mess up with you know different languages and you know even if it doesn't make sense it's it it is a thing but if if hydra code doesn't run then is it to steal a thing or not that's a good thing [Music] what do you think's floor i don't know what do i think um well i i think uh language is something really complex because uh nauto was saying uh you you check this kind of dictionary of javascript and then hydra has doesn't work like uh no really functional in that way and and then i think uh the the kind of levels of understanding in language because you have a metaphors or scientific uh texts and and and you can say something that it's also a non-functional language also uh and then you have like a conversation and yeah i kind of think it is a technology maybe but i'm not sure i i i just have a question that question because i really think a lot about language yeah because i experience language i mean i i'm trying always to express myself in english i speak in spanish and sometimes i don't speak properly in spanish and then i'm starting to study german and it has another logic and then you you think different when you think in english when you think in german or when you think in spanish time is different spanish is the hardest one i i think it it's so uh um amigos i don't know if that word exists it exists very much for me certainly i have to say like for me spanish is the most difficult language to express myself conceptually because i didn't learn to do the conceptual exercise while i was living in colombia that i'm originally from so my mother language is spanish but i i learned the process of doing conceptual work while i was using english so then and i don't have so many friends that to speak spanish with so and i'm living abroad for maybe 12 years now so i i speak with some people in spanish i have a really close friend of mine elkin that i know he will never will watch this video i think the kind of friend that he is i know but then sometimes he's asking me because he's curious and he wants to know what i'm doing and i really struggled to say to him like these words that i can find you know really because my spanish is like this and my english is like these so i i know the words that i have that i can use in english very fast but in spanish it's so broad and i don't have the exercise of trying to communicate what i'm thinking in spanish and so for me i i agree that but in that sense that if i have to choose then i just do it in english because it's the exercise that i that body that's what i know [Music] okay yeah i was thinking also it's a really potential tool i mean language because if you don't express yourself okay you will have troubles for being understood or just of being a person in the world but like in the practice we use very i don't know specific language or like floor you do like performance and you do you use language but it's not like you speak or you talk about the story but it's like very condensed or abstract that uh you you know it's very different from what you speak or even if in this kind of context you use different language from the performance performative language um so so what i don't have a question but uh but i think it's true like the the cognitive process so the cognition is different when if we put it in our context in the practice is the cognitive process is different than the one that i'm doing right now because it and it has to be a lot in our case or what we reflect upon is in terms of uh consciousness because right now in a way i'm more close to what i kind of think that i am so this this with all my identities and my frustrations and things so this but then in the practice we try to exercise something that we call self-dissociation which is the just basically trying to have agency of or possibility to to just become post-human from the uh understanding of donahue away like just to become something that is not this one that i am right now so the practice is that space where and then i try to then self-dissociate from this dominant consciousness that i have most of the time and then during the hour of the two hours of the practice i will try to use the mouse my body the dance the delay the glitch now auto sometimes but all the time but sometimes then also i will slow down and i will ask him something that i don't know and that's com that's that's coming back to this consciousness and say like hey now otto what is the functioning hierarchy you use for this and then and that will be just coming back but it's kind of like a car result that's the way how i experienced that thing so but yeah yeah i don't know i i don't know how i experience that i i'm not sure i have i don't believe i have like pure ideas because i feel like i'm always influenced by by what surrounds me and and and you can always connect what you think with something else what do you mean well because i i don't know maybe i think about something and then i find someone saying something similar or related to it and and i can't think you connect the dots right and then you connect the dots okay yes but that's how my brain works i keep on always connecting stuff like a nesting i don't know like a mesh 3d mesh endless mesh how was the coming back to the practice today um we did i mean we didn't talk much like as usual i think you asked like you know what the function is um oh video is dropping but um what no no no no yes okay so there was this um i felt like it was today again like hard to kind of read what you're doing what jorge was doing because uh sometimes you know you're not showing that the screen or something was i don't know glitching or something and i was like i felt like i should ask something you know like should i you know ask you is everything okay or do i need help but at the same time i was like maybe i don't care and i decided not to care today so much but but i was consciously looking at it and i was having the image and the in the wild uh life with your screen on the side and i was coming together and that was okay and you had my video in there so i was like okay he's you're looking at me so it's okay yeah yeah no today was today was very cool like i found it very interesting because like sometimes like in the workflow how we work with knowledge sometimes i use bdmx you know this vga software uh it's like resolume okay but for max and it's modular so there there's a lot of windows that are floating and stuff like that and then sometimes i'm using that uh but of course every time i have i will open that because it has so the interface that you have to build you take time until you build that thing um and normally i get super stressed with that but today somehow things were not working like normally but i was not stressed and i was more i was reusing videos that we have done in our sessions and i was being conscious of if there's too much motion in the video i should almost not moving or moving very slow because i will know i don't want to saturate the motion of the archive video so i was i was willing to transact i thought it was very interesting practice and i saw that you were consciously really looking up kind of i sit in the house always like very much in like tell me something you know i i really felt like it was like tell me something kind of like very very receiving and yeah it was it was good i felt it was very interesting so but i was okay that was okay yeah so this is this is time for like confession you know like it's like things sometimes these thoughts pass by during the practice but it's not something you have to ask you know are you okay in the practice yeah this is this is time to say it well but it's really important as a team or a collective or a group to support each other so i think it's it's something that uh yeah it's important to it's another part of working i guess but i think something that we haven't we have been talking of this before is we said that that basically that we have built this space of trust that is the practice and it's it's built only to insisting in in the format and just coming back every time and then just something that it just builds naturally and then you have some trust for the space but it's only because we have built that space that we can basically not give a of what the other one is doing without being rude because the space is already warm and it's not dangerous so then you you know that it's okay to just to not care about the other one but if we have if the space will not because we have been talking of this if the space would not have been built it would be more hard to be hundred percent me let's say and uh and go all on in my putas and i don't know whatever everything's crazy but this is like a question like because we want to kind of open the space i mean gradually we're doing it like first with the chat so now we have you floor as the guest um but then eventually like always the question uh maybe i can ask you as well like uh how can you participate in the practice that we do like i mean we have some thoughts already but maybe that's something i should ask you like if if we think about like doing something as you know three of us or maybe two of us i don't know uh but how can we do it well i i don't know i i'm really i feel like i really fluid on working with you so i i don't know i i'm not sure but uh i i guess i could help you with video i i don't know if i see myself like uh moving a lot with my body but um [Music] yeah i i guess i could help you to move videos i don't know what a question or thinking about different interactions like uh but i don't know i think the question was more in general because i mean we have this conversation that how can we we call this how we can sandbox the practice in a way that makes it accessible for to invite somebody else and join for one time and um so i play around as a playground something that is safe and so the protocols in a way they're safe and people can understand how they can join do what they want to do at the same time leave and not feel pressure of moving let's say or doing videos of um but in somehow that there is some yeah kind of protocols of yeah best practices yeah what to do what's like a germ like a german park that always there's like a fence and they close at night like seriously you know what uh but yeah it's like a kind of question like one idea we had this uh like the sandbox like a playground so that uh it's set like not separate but uh it's not like the practice that jorge and i do but we offer something where we can play uh with other people and uh uh what today would it say yeah like we just thinking about like maybe we can make a workshop format or something so that we can invite people uh easily uh while we have kind of separate from our regular practices okay well i'm thinking about this exercise we we made recently with with you now too like uh speaking one word and working around that that word for jamming so uh maybe you have something uh some point to start from so that maybe can can help someone who is sorry no no please go on girl no no no it's okay i i was just saying that maybe that that can help someone um that it's not really into improvising well that's that's really interesting because i think like going back to this thing idea because it works because we have shared a lot so you say a thing i mean floor or jorge you say a thing then i can okay let's do that thing and it works but if i just work with you know someone i don't know much then we cannot just start with a thing so we have to say you know like a bird or i don't know a cup and then maybe there's a place where we can start i don't know what was the thing when i started working with you like jorge or flor i don't know i don't really remember maybe that's with floor it's probably a hydra that we call it together with jorge maybe i mean it's more general i think the dance and uh this choreographic coding whatever that means i like it i like that you say whatever that means yes when we start talking of this and then we we are being okay actually the hard part will be or it is when my thinking like how to transmit or how to communicate in a workshop like the embodiment of what because we don't because it's yeah because it comes from the body so it's i mean speaking about dances oh is something that it has been difficult since always so it's not that we are just trying to yeah just speaking about something that is exponent it's just it it art yeah before or or after is not the dance itself you see what i mean like you can add comments or thoughts but the experience is not there like the dance experience is when you move and it's not rational in a way it yeah in a way it it allows the consciousness to free and just to go yeah to different spaces and not this one that we are right now but so it's a bit uh complicated that's what i feel like when we try to think in the in the workshop how can one transmute the invitation to move and not thinking in moving asking i am a professional dancer i am moving you know how to take away the idea of dance in this context as something that is as normal as just moving my hands or moving my hands with the mouse um maybe that could be a good that could be a an option then you're gonna start thinking then how why do you move your hand in the mouth and then being conscious of that like there's a motion that people will have their computers right or code as well you you type organ something you could also do these things yeah yes i i have this um conversation with uh grappo he's a friend and we have this dude and it's called code poetry and we we always talk about what's the what happens with with body when you are coding because you are like you have to you must have a lot of concentration uh and be really focused on on what you are doing especially if you are using more than just one language and [Music] and then we we were talking one day about this and then i had this idea that that when you that when you are calling to me it's like uh really similar when you're to the silence but the silence of uh of a body because you are uh like are really in a mental state and then your your body i know because i i had this feeling when i started goaling that it was really similar to meditation in a way because i i could really abstract myself from from the rest of the world i see that's really interesting because for me it's totally different i would say like today i remember at the end i started playing uh what is it uh david guetta and then uh i wrote a move and then i was like no i cannot move with this music with my body so i have to change the color so i thought immediately like i have to code this way and then maybe i should just put like a little subtitle of the title of the song and i cannot just you know start coding coding so i have to like super quick like think about what i can do in 10 seconds and then i just code and then i can go back to move and that was like a really like you know running for i don't know 50 meters and that's it i mean then i start dancing but that was really like short impulse that i had but did you hear what were you trying to share your sound because i didn't hear your sound oh really but then it wasn't okay so the microphone didn't pick it up then that's too bad i i was more in a meditative state of doing something yeah because you weren't moving so much so i was like yeah yeah well that's interesting i don't know what's interesting but yeah i really like this this is a glitch like oh oh i thought you were actually just like no i mean for me it is like this is for instance like i i have this project that i'm uh i'm going to arse electronic in september to show my work and so and then there is this project that i did with the uh joe kaimu we did a uh our iot device that it measures the levels of we said excitement but it's basically the temperature of your earlobe and with that we create visuals and we have a performance based on that and then i have been researching with him basically because we have to do all this technical stuff on his hardware and coding then i have been interested since few years i'm working with technology just for five years since few years how can i break the body from i mean how to from that state and then just making it make force him force the body in a way to do something else so for instance we were doing a a a workshop uh in in hackers and designers in amsterdam and then part of the workshop was like people were helping us to soldering the devices and then i have to go for the second okay sorry so maybe we dance in the meantime oh thank you thank you by the way uh dan for uh writing in the chat i don't know if jorge's i think dan is writing on my streaming so if you're on you have to go to youtube you cannot see it and then yeah i can click the best practices page which is a shame we have to have a nice interface okay so what i was saying um yeah in short like so people basically we were soldering and working on the technology but then it was a negotiation and it was in a consciousness uh between the joe kaimo that is the other artist and me we said at some point two times per day uh there is a yeah say every two hours we close computers no matter what you're doing and you have to then follow me a little bit and of course that was difficult to follow in the beginning because often the people will start getting a flow in the code or something and then they have to stop but that was a negotiation we agree with them are we going to do this but we have to do all of us to gather this and then deal with the frustration of it because the idea was to get out and then to come back um as as in the movies when it when you're filming that people stop the film in certain way and you have to take care of all the constraints because if i stop the shooting like here and i want to continue here in two days after i need to know how were the light conditions and everything here right so and that was the idea with the coding practice like understanding that you should be able and flexible enough not not for becoming a better coder that was not the purpose of that wasn't my intention or intention but was just to propose the body uh within the practice because i understand what floor is saying and i relate with that sometimes but then for me it's always since i'm coming from dance trying to understand how i can give agency to my body because my body exists inside yes yes yeah i agree i mean that that is why we we were talking about that and also i i had to add that uh this was a couple of years ago and and i'm not sure i have always that feeling uh sometimes it's more uh now those experience uh better but i was thinking maybe on on on this idea of thinking how body is involved with the computer and the computer it's involved with with the body in order to think what we were saying today before you know like uh about martial mcluhan and and thinking about it as an extension and what what happens with that relationship but at the same time i feel that it's just then that's my that's my interest like to insist and not understanding because i don't want to understand actually i'm trying to get away from the the cognitive process of understanding because i don't need to understand and i believe my body can just do what it needs to do as i was when i was a baby uh or one by drunk and then i just danced with her or when i make love for these kind of things so but then oh no i think he's gone at the important part here's the bottom line i don't know like that sorry sorry jorge you're dropping so can you say that important line again same stay in the line uh what i was saying like that it's important to insist that like i try to i really uh want to not understand but i want to to to find out for instance in the excuse that we have because it's an excuse that we have in a way with now to try to communicate this framework in a sandbox a playground is how to manage to give agency to somebody to move not to dance but to move and to get take the idea away of that of because in somehow i feel this idea of dancing scares a lot of uh of somebody my hair scare people no it's not like a hip-hop like when you have the circle and you have to go in there i know you you remind me of of this idea of uh you know like a cinematic art like uh there is a uh an artist from here in argentina that it's a really famous for that it's julio le park and and the idea was that there are these uh kind of sculptures uh this is before opt art or maybe it's related to all part and this idea is that you have some sculpture that is moving but you have to move in order to see the movements of of the sculpture or that also happens maybe without art you have to move just to see the movement of the image so you are moving but you are not really going to consider that i'm sorry that you're that you're not that you're moving uh yeah yeah i think i like that i like that idea it's interesting actually so that uh the the participants have to move in order to proceed the to the next step of the workshop they cannot just sit and like wait for the next one yeah yeah i like i like that and actually it could be even very simple you know like you have to move so you have you understand my part and you have to move it could be very simple yeah it could be very simple actually it doesn't have to be complicated because that's not the intention actually it's not yeah it's not that's not the intention yeah the intention actually to be honest will be if somebody can just join and even just to you know prepare four or five three functions of hydra no more than that and then just other things so then just all in a way like select amount of elements and then from there just uh yeah propose a jam basically where people actually they don't feel overwhelmed because there's so much things going on which in a way is i think the best way to enjoy i think when i have one of when i have the best time when we do the practice is when i'm completely completely unprepared uh i mean like today i was late and it was it was nice i think it works the best for me in that way maybe it could also be related to i can always think on the art key sorry but i i think about also this idea of happening so you have uh sorry yes i don't say it it was an inside joke but just please finish and then i told you oh but because i could not hear okay um i don't know like like uh creating a a series of instructions so people can can do that and and and have a like uh the experience of something that is happening uh but maybe yeah it's not like something necessarily necessary linear or yeah yeah seems like also in the chat done is uh saying uh like reference to john cage but basically like that kind of those artists that idea right um yeah yeah yeah i mean that's something that i i didn't i didn't consider maybe we can start thinking with closing soon also yeah maybe we can like go to the the last question that we we have to always ask this to choose the hashtag for this uh chat so i guess floor can you maybe uh how do you say like a find a hashtag for for this to close this chat we can choose any spanish and english yeah don't worry or you can make it super long johanna made it like you know one paragraph of hashtag can i say hashtag experience experience uh okay floor thank you so much for joining us super cool i mean i feel that we can just i keep on talking and talking and talking uh yeah we just we just first closed the streaming so uh yeah thank you for coming thank you for all the viewers especially uh dan who's actually engaged in the chat you have to come we will write to you and uh we'll have you in the chat at some point so yeah if you're watching this please uh like the video and subscribe to the channel and thanks for thanks for watching see you thank you next next week or so thank you", "Sxw5jV1SzFI": "so is it backstage i think we can do this is a this is a chat do the chat sure chat with the plants this is so nice like if i was doing uh i like this i like this because eva started becoming a character you know because once i'm in in this chat or in this at this framework that we have then i refer to her as i not referred to her never yeah so she's becoming in like i imagine her as a character sufficient character so she anyway so eva did put her plants because they were too dry or something so but yesterday was full we have to be plants like kind of monster plants you see we have that those big plants so it was just the terrace was full of plants and it was really nice just to come out and it had this feeling of like a chinese garden in notes you know it was raining it was raining and it was very relaxing yeah i really like it i it's too bad that like i didn't film anything there like i should have taken at least like photos i think i have some pictures but like no i don't think so because i thought it was that is so weird i think this is very weird because i thought it was respectful somehow you know what i mean and i don't know how to feel about it like there are some spaces and like because then i thought okay this is a chinese garden it will be a garden i will take a picture i have no problem with it but because it's a chinese garden and somehow then i'm i think i try i like to imagine myself like somewhat concerned about or like until at least careful with something then i will be oh no i think i didn't took a picture because of the i was being respectful with the space i think about that i remember because i wanted to yeah i took different pictures but i think if i remember i think i refrained myself that also maybe because you were with me so i don't know maybe you know you have more information about what is a chinese garden than myself all these assumptions but funny i'm trying to find it on google maps but i don't know if they have any photos inside i mean they're they're messages they should have and this is funny how so can you maybe start saying what you we were you where we just finished in the chat about the emojis i was just i just said yeah let me just introduce that i just said to the author that we start with this thing from art and designer now but we spoke of that last time but that's not what's in that chat in the chat we spoke about the art and designer yeah like and the emojis so there is the emojis in an iphone at least when you type now because it was different back in 2018 which is weird that's what i don't understand 2018 when you type designer with that artist you have this emoji with a thunder face like somebody weird you know uh but when you type designer you have this kind of painter holding a palette of color and a pencil that was like that that was that was that was the designer the emoji which is weird but the and the artist was more like crazy it has just a thunder was more like a punk uh which in a way i thought it was really represented the spirit in a way i thought like oh okay so yeah um then like now if you type artist or designer you both the both emojis are the same uh yellow emoji with the artist with the palette and the pencil this is super weird the brush and then [Music] i think you call up pencils also the small maybe brushes mean i know that in german it's something like that but anyway anyway we know what we're talking about yeah but then i point out i point out that it's that the emojis like yellow emojis they bypass identity politics so then if for instance sometimes i use a brown hand emoji or a brown brown something and and that means something to me i don't know for the person who received it but so then that deals more more yeah the emoji if i will send a yellow one like then those things bypass ident politics but then now otto was saying something about it but i don't know if it's true yeah but so yeah there are two things there are two things one is because i thought yellow is from like our skin color because the emoji is from japan but i'm not sure but that makes sense because if they chose a color if it's white then you know it's a bit weird perhaps not black then why not yellow so that that's i mean either if it's intentional or not that's something i would relate or many people would relate i would say but how do you find that what what were you researching about no the research thing is another thing that is about so that's the second thing that is basically i don't remember i don't even remember if i read that paper or not but basically they're saying that uh because on android and ios and like windows other platforms they have different emojis i mean they have the same set of emojis but the images are different yeah depending on the platform so that actually like um conveys different like slightly different emotions and that that was the kind of topic of the research so but it's kind of like it seems to me a bit like you know when you're writing uh when you're making a website and then you have like like it's not like best practices for me when i'm doing websites like functional websites is like i use system font because i like that because there's the font that i'm if if you know how you use it if you use a phone system font then whatever the browser is using will use the computer's font and then i found that it's nice because i'm used in my computer i will use to i think it's now to sensor whatever is the mac is using uh so that's something that i that i use um but why am i saying that because of the emojis and the i i just when you when we use when we when you select some web web fonts then always there will be a backdrop you know like uh if you type if you use some fancy fonts sometimes depending on the browser in most of the cases because of internet explorer that will be the font will not be there will not be that font so then it will be then you put in order uh yeah other phones to be used right in case that that one is not then you backdrop to that one another yeah all the way to just flat serif or sans area yeah and yeah i mean that's that's how you do it in css right like you have the font family and you have this specific name and then if it doesn't work then another one and then you know ends up yeah that's what i was saying yeah the beautiful language of css css [Music] i think most of the font doesn't have emojis so it ends up with a system font right the font itself because emojis have no like most of the fonts don't have emojis right yeah so they have glyphs but they don't have emojis yes so it will anyways end up with a system emojis whatever font you use yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so they go back to system yeah like to system and what's it true but then the problem is that like for example like iphone and android and i don't know if there's still windows phone but i know that windows have different uh set of like like you know pictograms or the images of emojis so it's you're not saying the same thing right and that's like the i think the research is about you know because sometimes it's really um subtle you know like if it's is it crying or is it actually laughing and crying and these things are like different like it gives different impressions on like the different images so it's actually highly highly political if you only have friends with iphones then it's fine but it's not the case so yeah that is funny like for instance i don't know if it happens to you i don't know if you still i think it still happens in my phone i have the iphone i don't know 5 years and now i have an iphone 8 and it still didn't happen in whatsapp when a friend of mine is sending i don't know i guess an uh maybe a glitch a gif i mean or something like that uh in my notifications when the cell phone is blocked i see like a rainbow and it always that's what i that's i think that's what i see or something like a wave i mean something that is not at all what the person is sending but then i will see this then somehow it reminds me like a rainbow or something sweet so then depending on the person who is just talking to me i just see this person sent me a heart you know like why this person sent me hard uh they it is this happening to you remember this happening in your phone when your phone is locked and if you see a notification will you see some kind of emoji attached to the name of the person what emoji attached to that person say if say if i'm trying to send you a gift then the other way around if you send me a gift or some of this kind of yeah i guess a gift or maybe an emoji that i don't have should be then it will come in my phone as standard it becomes kind of like a rainbow or a wave oh because i know that like some messengers i don't know um about what's up but they have actually like um i would say like description of the gif or stickers yeah the stickers they usually have this um you know if it's like laughing face then it's like translated also like mapped to the laughing face emoji yeah yeah and like like for people like that like the alt when in when you're coding and you type the out like they are for people who who cannot see your flying door yeah yeah yeah that's i think that's mostly for the the notification because you cannot show the image well you can maybe but uh it's you know compressed so it's better to see it in emojis which is actually problematic too because that may you know if the creator of that sticker wasn't careful enough maybe you know it's just a sign laughing face for like sad emotions or something yeah because that generates a glee a glitch that's a glitch yeah because then because then for instance if it's a notification say uh it's something related with work and then i'm just relaxed then i see this rainbow wave kind of thing that i'm describing instead of just ignoring him i will just like that will catch my attention i will try to go through should i open this message is is this rainbow saying something that i need to check right now um and also there's ligatures i know that we had we had a issue with this before but um you know like the emojis are like the new set of sets of emojis have like combinations of characters so if you have like um someone biking and then there's the next if the next character is like the female sign then it combines together and makes a female viking all true that's probably because if you have an issue with this no no it's not a completion it's it's actually like in the in the byte code it's like two like two characters like it's it's it's really about like a ligature you know like the when the phone connects two or three characters together like if you have like double double f oh the center put it all together i mean if the font has that uh combination then it will be replaced by that and emojis do it too so if you have this female sign that then becomes the first emoji becomes the female version but if if the and what he said doesn't have the female version then it will just show the emotion the first emoji and the female sign yeah and i remember you had this problem with this this uh it was you with you know like questioning like asking oh yeah facebook true yeah that was that was really nasty you know like i didn't understand why but that was i think that was a mistake that wasn't an error or of facebook for a while is this a facebook or something no it wasn't that wasn't facebook no though when you were talking with someone else like uh so he sent me oh yeah okay yeah specifically for some yeah yeah yeah and i think that was because the app was you know not supporting these exceptions so they just like broke the emoji into two pieces oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah because i was getting i understand i uh i was getting just this ah it was with somebody it was with the the presenter in note i think that she was sending something and then i was just receiving this constantly and i was like what do you mean until i see her because we were trying to have a coffee or something and she was her neighbor and then when she came then i just said like what do you mean with this i said like no what is that that she was just sending i think messages like emojis but they were all the time just doing i i don't know so like with weird things happen also like i think they they have like different uh patterns of like this family emoji like three or four people together and that's also like that's like the worst example of the ligature like i think i don't know how many characters like sequence uh it is but you know like it's actually like a few emojis together and then it's like compressed into looks like one character right wait because but i want to go back to the to the for a second today a second if the if this that you said is true that for some reason then the emojis are yellow because they come from japan like from where those things start like when they had like you know like this foldable um cell phones back then really back then as well as as well as well in japan um because they they may create their own protocol for emojis and stuff and now there is a lot of structure as well there is a lot of tradition with images no like there's a lot of culture like like manga anime a lot of like animations in a way maybe it's brilliant i don't exactly know but yeah because also like i think the difference is like in english you can like kind of have like abbreviations or like um maybe not i don't know i just feel like in english it's easier to like express something with like fewer words yeah yeah maybe not english is a very easy english english it's a very uh easy language in a way you know like that's why many people communicate through english but yeah i feel like in japanese it's hard like first of all like one character is like super big you know like it's it's like the it's like it takes a square instead of like the you know this rectangular tall or back out of it it's more mostly like that even if it's like monospace it doesn't take so much space but japanese is like always takes the square so maybe it's convenient to have emojis but i don't know but it was already a thing and it was like never you know exported uh outside so okay and then the history of it is as far as i know when they released iphone in japan they also saw iphone of course but then they thought somehow uh without emojis people won't use it so they just added like i felt it was terrible like i still feel that it was just on iphone it's quite like it's not so good um but that's the original set like it's based on the original set from the like when they added uh in the japanese version and then since then i think it's added to the universal iphone os and they you know because it's there people started using it and then started adding more emojis and of course like you know there are like new sets of emotions i mean it was just like full of like japanese stuff like you you don't understand like like some of them um but then now like they have like uh like a cup for mate or something like they they try to add things from different cultures yeah but then yeah i mean it seems it makes sense to me what you're saying like um but so if we think so satan is it comes from japan is happening this in in this way then are yellow just by uh chance and it's just because of it was made in japan say then that's a clear example of globalization you know of like for instance like how like just now i mean this that we talking so it makes sense to me right and also i was i grew up with game culture i don't play games anymore but i i was playing with my i i have the attack to the 2060 like famicom nintendo super nintendo oh i mean until the xbox and then i stopped because i was too old and then i started doing something else but i grew up in that culture so and it was very influenced by of course even japan for example like this is like so random emoji it's it's like fish cake it's a fish cake but it's like really like a japanese thing but it's there because why not what are the funny things i mean obviously now they added like more things from like outside japan so it's quite like a mix of culture what i was trying but i think what i was trying to say is like it's funny to see how something that is cultural this is in a way appropriation of culture because something that it comes from a cultural place is cultural right and responds to a culture then um once it goes like in the way who i use it or the well i guess yeah the way how i just use it then you don't um for me it's neutral to think uh the yellow emoji is neutral and the other ones are the ones that have uh identity qualities um but if you think that it comes then from japan and then the yellow is because it's from japan um that is just completely and uh uh is its appropriation of the culture you know it's isn't that it's something that it's yeah it does i think that's the definition in a way of appropriation in the sense of just takes it from the culture you know this one yeah that i'm used to that already but that's a hospital no no what is that this is called oops this is called um love hotel which is uh oh wow i thought it was a hospital no there is a hospital too i think what i love hotels i i read i mean i saw something by chance like the last week but maybe you can tell what is the love hotel well you know it's it's a if i say it in a like a harvest way it's it's a place where young people uh hang out in the suburbs when they have no other entertainment um you know i mean that's where you you go to you know with your partner and have sex that's important then you can you know stay for a night or stay during the day and uh yeah yeah motel yeah but that only exit well not only is in summer but i know that they are in tokyo as well but they usually have like in tokyo there's like a district where there's like you know like one or two blocks like full of love hotels so you just go there and you find one i don't know that's how it works it seems but yeah specifically in the emoji set which is so funny i think yeah in kilometers a huge culture of that and uh because then you will be living with your parents until yeah that's very in colombia you stay with your mom until yeah until you get married more like that's like male is very you get i don't know how is now but before you stay in colombia until you as a man until you get married more or less or you go living with your girlfriend so before you leave then your mom is cooking your mom is i mean you have this relationship with the mom is doing and then of course even if you're working while you want to leave that nice place you don't have to pay you don't have to do anything you can you save the money they clean you they feed you all this thing that's very matriarchal uh and then because of that there is a lot of business of uh the i think in spanish yeah hotel uh and there are some areas of the city like but big because yeah there are there are areas of the city they are they're spreading some spaces in the city but there are i don't know there is an area where i know should be could be around 10 blocks around with big buildings of 30 floors [Music] and another place and then you have different ones i have been i have been there and then you have different you know you have from the ones who are just completely flat just a place to be but then you have thematic ones you have like just any kind of crazy things yeah yeah very fun very fun to think about it yeah yeah it's also funny because i think in korea it's called motel as well but in japan it's it's called love hotel which is i feel it's too explicit but anyways but i think it's cool i like that i like that it sounds and i like now i i didn't know that that emoji was for that now it makes sense i thought it was a hospital yeah but there is one with a cross but there is one with a cross that's the hospital yeah they love hotel you see like yeah i was yeah yeah yeah love hotel i hope i didn't send a love hotel back then to somebody [Laughter] [Music] i wonder why that person stopped talking to me afterwards hello good morning 7 30 in the morning i just have an appointment we met 3 30 love hotel wow very very sweet um shall we talk about what did we did the last session the the day the day the whole day yeah so i yesterday i listened to it again i don't know if you checked but i uploaded the the part of the chat separately i just yeah i saw that you uploaded separately and then i put the uh how to say not the annotations but the index like the timestamps yeah and hashtag because you know the hashtag hashtag fail hashtag fail hashtag totally fail hashtag totally fail because if you put hashtags on youtube they also like highlight as a hashtag and you can i think you can also search i'm curious if they there's like anyone else who failed totally failed totally fail yeah there must be there must be like stupid videos i could fail but i like that i think totally fail the hashtag i like that one i think but i think she said i totally failed the hashtag i want to go back i like that because it gives space to that's a glitch in itself totally fail hashtag totally failed the hashtag so i checked my totally failed videos and there are three videos and one of them is ours and uh i don't want to even watch it but the first one is called uh hot sauce challenge totally failed ooh that sounds super good well with 30 views yeah i have a question like what happens if somebody clicks on the website uh because we have now this website where people can just go and see your live streams side to side um via iframes so what happens if somebody clicks and go to the page what happens with the views are those views count in youtube when they watch on the page i think so when the because iframe so it's it's basically just opening youtube yeah so they said yeah i was thinking the same no it should be counting from both sides and they are obsessed with counting so why not should be counting for both sides yeah because basically just the playback and as soon as the playback is there it should start counting and also like i added the script that automatically plays both when you start watching one of them yeah yeah i saw that um so i think what was interesting from this time is we were trying to be more thoughtful i would say in the sense we try to keep a structure before so when in the time before the people for the people try to in this order because now we we now also we are trying to in the guest yeah but now that we're trying to invite more people so if you guys are watching and you think this is awesome then just you can refer to other people so yeah so we are with the and in this quest of trying to share the word uh share the content and sharing the medium because this is not content this is medium and then so then we thought one way is to propose a structure and the proposed time because normally the way how we will do is we met say at 10 in the morning and then from there we will start seeing how do we feel during the day and then from there we will propose the structure which works very well for us but then it's not so easy for other people if they try to follow and if there is some guess for the chat definitely is not so polite to say like can you join us please today in the chat watch during the whole seven hours at some point we will say it when we start the chat i think it's a big statistic i think will be a bit too much actually if somebody's doing that i won't like you you know like and yeah i don't know joey said you know like we upload everything and then you know maybe luckily someone will watch it but i didn't i replied that babies i'm unlucky that they watched it that from the numerous videos online that they watched hours maybe they are not lucky i don't know by the way i was counting because now i'm writing this paper so now on the part i'm writing the technical uh yeah the technical report that i have done and then so i have more roughly 160 hours that we have on on material how that's 160 hours already so if you are committed you can start watching now and how many days does i'm taking 160 hours actually this is not so much 24 years is less so like eight days yeah seven days something like this so it's not so bad it's so it's not so bad so somebody can start doing that and tell us how it goes that's that's i don't know yeah baby don't let's don't don't don't don't go somewhere else we're trying to stay in this and what we did and so yeah we proposed this um so the day some days before we proposed already okay let's try to just jump right away in the development time already we have a structure that is very defined for some time ago we have development time the time where we just try to figure out things that we might like to do kind of like a ketchup if we haven't done before um and then after we have some pausa sometime to time off then we come back right into the sauce as a practice then the practice is the hot sauce and that's the practice and then after the practice we have a little pause and then we come back to talk and this is actually yeah and then to talk this is actually to say that this is super positive from inviting joanna and from a guest that this is the first time when we have this structure that i'm not tired when i'm talking in the chat i don't know how you felt about it i didn't know until now i don't know if it was because of the practice or because of the chat but it was you know refreshing in a way yeah for me was completely just thinking just now yeah and it didn't uh yeah i think it's it's good to have like different energy in the chat yeah yeah because like if somebody so in the past we have we spoke the when we have these structures and then we try to come back to the chat to just have one basically it's because we what we try to have just one stream to one link one day to not cut the the the streaming the live streaming so and then basically because normally before this proposal we will just do the practice and then we come back like now and then just talk about what happened the day before or some days before but now since we are trying to keep everything in this structure we have to come back after i don't know half an hour one hour and then chat and then we have uh noticed it in the past that we are very tired and it's almost like it's just not easy to jump in that state of talking like now when before what you're trying to do is dissociate your consciousness and then just play with the glitches and hardware software and so on um so i think that was a completely wing and i just meant uh again i'm mentioning but that this would it was passing and she's like which camera was like it's pointing there's pointing that mitch you are like looking like i just took a shower no that yeah that was positive the to have a person in a chat it's just refreshes i didn't feel tired at all at that moment after that thank you joanna that was a form i mean that was super nice like the i didn't thought of that this is a formula this is actually if you think in formula that's a formula to refresh you because you are tired like after seeing each other for i don't know for sharing that space for six hours and then you have to come back to talk it's like oh i mean that's a best practice so maybe punctually what we could say like in this in the in the practice what happens is that for some reason i don't know why i decide to do things that i don't do like four months ago i think three months ago not one but two of them one of them is like using multiple cameras i think the last nine sessions or yeah i think just at the beginning when i was in puff i used multiple cameras but after i didn't use more than just an extra one in the practice that we did i was using four cameras so this is i don't know why so that was one thing and the other one is like i wanted to use bdmx so that's already and i didn't try all these things together so that was from my point of view my practice so that was that i tried to do that and of course i was super overwhelmed from that i like i like your arrow i like your arrow that was cool thanks i don't like somehow the arrow i don't know why but i like that arrow because it started getting for me that's you're trying to say something like this is more like personal than me like this is speaking but then that arrow because it is like in the best practices for us in a way we start standing is like switzerland it's an independent place that doesn't want to compromise in wars and stuff like that so you have to keep yourself away from the practice because otherwise the practice might suck you up and kill you so so in that space yeah so so in that space then is a the arrow was really nice i really like it it was very organic to what was happening with the arrow what were you doing with the arrow like maybe you can tell the people i mean not the yeah but just what what what the what what what blob arrow blue well it's just that uh i had an arrow and i was playing with arrow oh the cursor that's what i say but at one point i was like you know like this is i don't know when where it came from but somehow like i started to think like a connection to pluto i know i don't like this because i i know that at one point everyone everyone's talking about pluto you know i do this and brutal and this concept is this and brutal like it was like that i mean i think it's still like that so i but um try to not go is one people is when people like refer me when when people connect me with colombian dancer and salsa and i'm like oh my god i'm gonna kill you i'm a colombian dancer and then salsa i mean because you're japanese and then bhutto and then if they put you together in that space already they're like oh yeah you know but right you born i mean but that's that's actually i think there's one extra layer that makes it weird because brutal is not really popular in japan but i think people don't know it right if you're like well like if you're really into pluto then probably know it but uh if you know a little bit of it then you know i am japanese and i do i do brutal for example if i say it then they would say think that it's natural but it's totally not like i don't know how many people are actually doing in japan except those weird people anyways i'll continue um you know but i think it's like i don't know if if you read this uh so actually so okay so i thought like you know intuitively like there are two concepts that i had one is this performativity of machines which i don't know what is what's performativity what performativity of machines okay like how machines can perform that's like it's not like a something concrete that i have in mind but i'm just starting to think what is it because we always perform with well not perform but practice is let's say we perform it's not a performance but we've performed with machines because i think i think i think there is something that i want to kind of try to understand from what you're saying is like do you mean like perform yeah like from the point of view of performance as efficiency or pro or from performativity as in identity politics because the two things are different in my understanding see i see one is more once it's more referred it's in reference to effectiveness yes and the other one is more to politics in a way but what's the efficiency you mean like performance like performance like in a like a really pure sense of performance yes yes yes yes that's like what's expected and how much no exactly i mean of course it's related it's it's in their politics because they cannot avoid from the performance of the you know the competition because that's you know it's just like how we have you know we are our height and skin color and stuff that machines there have they have their own identity politics and but that's kind of the thing that i started to think about and um then i thought like you know i mean on one hand i think it's totally like nonsense because they don't think that way i think they don't care if i'm doing practice or not the machine does yeah they don't care they just do what they do but then that i mean actually i think they care i think they care of a part of like giving an animation life i think they care in terms of performance you know because if you do the practice then yeah so so that's i think that's that's a good point like i start to think that how they how what they think is interesting is not what i think is interesting or what you think is interesting so that's kind of the one of the the question i had and then i started thinking like maybe it's something about pluto because why not yeah and then then like i think like two days ago delicious fish two days ago like i started thinking like okay what if i just look for online course to learn brutal which i think probably doesn't exist but actually there's a really good material from um ko university which has the archive of uh and they have like uh it's not i mean it is free for like a trial um so i subscribed and started like it's just like reading material of like and watching some videos of pluto and they explain the history of hijikata and but i think it's cool because like they have some quotes and um i haven't like i only like read like first part of it but i really like this quote that uh he said there's a human being not walking but made to walk not living but made to live not dying but made to die in this total pass passivity despite it even the fundamental fight vitality of human nature is paradoxically revealed and i i just like i i thought it's really nice because it's uh if i think about machines that's from bhutto that's from the izukata so i i you know changed the text and uh i don't know if you find it the dock that we share but uh there's a cursor not clicking but made to click not dragging but made to drag not dropping but made to drop in this total passivity blah blah blah so like i i feel like really i don't want to make a analogy but i think it's a strategy i i think like i mean a part of like there are things that you're trying to express that i don't understand well maybe i don't need to understand them because you are like just something that you're just you're curious about what i think is interesting to share is like the strategy uh well i mean uh that what i can apport or like say in that regard is that i found that the strategy is interesting the wait i'm just opening the hybrid dog because i thought i think like this idea like this uh way of hijacking things already i i don't know what did you what did you put it at the bottom or oh it's next to the sandbox but next to where the sandbox so it's in the middle um should i just continue something no so so when i did the cursor in the practice i mean the text was like i came back to this i mean came across with text afterwards but the idea is that i commit to be a cursor and that's it and that's that's really like i i don't know i don't want to say like this this is really like that sounds really wrong but uh well they might be like this it might be brutal 2.0 um what do you think is point zero don't do two point zero or post four point zero didn't call it 2.1 call it with the 2.1 plus plus uh no but i don't know also if you so like will be interesting if you can put that question that you you say something i propose something that is like questioning for the sake of questioning i don't know if you saw it yeah and i opened a comment there so maybe that could be interesting if you put the question that you were saying at the beginning about with the machine but i think it's interesting this uh about performance and i think it's i don't know how do you frame it but i think it was interesting because because if i have to go and questioning you trying to dissect the question is because it's a question that by itself is abstract like yeah and i think that's interesting uh so yeah that could be nice if you can just i just put the question there um the other thing was yeah in relation to their uh strategies and methodologies because i did as well that exercise like from so i i took from the text that i share with you in the morning and i don't know if i if you saw it but then i just changed and i tried to make it neutral so i took away the you and me and then i replaced it very often with blob so i blow it out yeah okay and now i understand the the engine and then i make the analogy then i make the analogy with the cursor because that's an strategy to hijack something and make something that to re-signify it then we go back to the beginning yeah yeah because then we just because it makes sense because like how we write because we are it's also like like the practice when we're in the sandbox because we cannot look at the myself writing from outside of myself so if you're writing then it's you writing but afterwards you can change it maybe a little device or you know like change the the the wording to make it so that you are not the one you're writing i think i think you touch i don't know if you understand completely what you're saying but you touch something that in a way you want to try to introduce or the way i catch it in my head is this idea of a temporality with with text is something that you can or yeah it's not only with text because you can do it also with images but saying in this example with text the a temporality of how one's consciousness come comes in out is something that is uh it's intro i mean it gives a space for for this that you were just mentioning the temporality in the great thing uh because as you said maybe i need to stop writing for me from me but uh next time i i can just do a different exercise not from the same knee uh because there is a trace i think that's that's that i'm trying to link somehow maybe i will can make it more clear because this is coming from joanna and it has to be with the emojis uh the signifier and the signified that is coming from uh philosophy you don't remember from who now um but yes this idea that you can go in time back in time based on the traces like based on those traces and the the the words the language text based is very uh gentle and kind with this and i think it's nice because if we know that we can come back as a different person then it's okay to write something that makes you feel vulnerable or um yeah yeah because you think you're in the sandbox yeah yeah exactly yeah i like actually i like this idea actually because the sandbox in a waste of space no so what if you think actually sandboxing as an as an active word you know because i see it more like an as an arbor armor you know like you're becoming power ranger you're sandboxing yourself you know you are becoming the emoji with the thunder in the face and then you just become the artist in 2018 it's really funny that you said power ranger because i don't know it's just like so funny because it's it's like the best sandbox ever because they have their like shooting set you know like when they um transform to i don't know what's called power rangers then they suddenly like go to space where there's like nothing around so it's like a sandbox like you can do whatever it's not in the middle of the city and you won't you know damage anything it is explosion and stuff it's okay because there's like nothing around where like in i think i had to get lost what where i was talking about power rangers like what a chapter you mean a chapter of power rangers oh i don't know if it i don't know exactly which series but like then if they have like serious fight they just go to somewhere like it's they don't fight in the middle of the city i mean they sometimes do but if they do it in japan they do in like there was i grew up i grew up seeing something that i don't remember the name but it was japanese and they thought those ones are the same it was not power rangers but it was some of the series where they they put together and they were yellow blue green and with this kind of suits and then at some point they put together and they have their own machines say i don't know one is a tiger yeah though one was a lion the other one was an eagle red eagle and at some point they they merged their machines and they become this messenger seat kind of guy but they were fighting in in tokyo they were fighting in the city no i mean okay they do it in the city as well but it's like usually they there's no other people they don't do it in the pedestrian and i know well because where i grew up uh they have like a popular uh shooting area that they often use for doing these kind of things yeah so i recognize sometimes it's the space but anyways but that place is you know like it's always empty and uh um it's they also use it like a stage for like uh local events so they have this like it's like open space so it's easy to block people and there won't be people coming in and that's like the sandbox for them that power rangers don't uh hurt anyone no but the villain yeah i just saw this like and also with the robots you know they when they have the final fight they you know they they get onto the huge robot but when they do it they it looks like they're like buildings but it's a miniature of the buildings that's like the they're so cool and i was so cool like the best sandbox i think it's so cool because then i think i saw this i guess back i don't know some time ago not too long ago and then i just tried to go back in my memory how cool was it you know like and now that i see just a marquette that is just being destroyed with these sparks sparks they put in the maquette and you see almost like if somebody's moving almost there the toy like it's just so incredible how imagination is you know like how powerful your imagination is you know and how lazy and limited you're getting with the technology also that for instance like if you think just in movie and cinema and effects like now because we are used to with these things are well done they don't have to imagine too much then yeah they also like you know i think uh like with a i think they were like really like advertising that they actually crashed the plane into the the airport what is tenant the one uh was it last year uh that the it's a time travel but it's about time travel or time reversal time no and then uh who's the director the guy from the interstellar christopher nolan and there they you know make this you know advertisement that they like actually like not flew the airplane but they drove the airplane into the building and actually like made this huge explosion um but they did it really which is you know i mean okay it's great but like why no not why it's different end of the spectrum and the other side is the power ranger that does it without destroying it yeah i think there is something very very very cool with the like you know like once like generation that's the way how i understand that i'm getting old is when i start or that i'm not part of certain generation is when i when i see that i cannot understand what is going on you know like not from like say rationally then i understand but then it's like it's a glitch in my head like why you do that you know trying to understand what some young people will do let's say and then i then then you think like okay this is just because i i'm from a no different generation um and that's culture but then so i mean there is something between the the medium itself which is the culture and then the content that the people that the culture is trying to share like there are certain actions that they they say young people will do to each other or like just symbols gestures no simple gestures you know like when people are so people at some point they start doing some things like i don't know so movements in certain ways that just become viral and things those gesture they try to they com they convey a message that is abstract um yeah there is something interesting that i cannot grasp but it has to be in relation with the medium and the content yeah i mean content or gesture or also like mean and that's yeah it's not just they it's not just fun but and they i don't even know if there's meaning but the meaning is that they share it right in the same generation and that's how you feel attached to it so it's actually like different from gesture because it's not just one person trying to send something to another person but it's more about shared experience but then then yet the other person needs to yeah okay yeah but it's still like yeah the other person needs to make something out of it or maybe not that because in a gesture yeah it happens that normally you're trying to communicate something right like with a gesture then you're there is something there in the gesture um that is attached to the image or to whatever it is um maybe in the example that you're putting the example you're putting with the mem the yeah maybe just the it's just the meme itself that is communicating not the content that is what is relevant no but it's not true i think it's the con like i think in the mem very often the content is very important you know like there is there is there's no i'm saying when i say mean it's not the content of the meme but the format of the mean because that's the most important thing of the meme i think because i can just have my photo and just put text that's not a meme i mean maybe if i'm funny enough but it has to be a drake no yeah it has to be or someone mimicking me someone mimicking trick gesture but then becomes a gesture because somebody somebody somebody else has to interpret that anyway somebody else has to make something out of it otherwise it's just speaking in the void i think there are two things that that's what makes it interesting that one is the content of the meme what drake is saying but the other thing is that it's drake what do you mean with drake i mean i mean uh i'm just saying about the meme with drake you know the oh okay the hotline i think so say it again because i think i lost you yeah so two things one is that the format itself that there is drake you know two pictures of drake and there's text and that already is like sharing something whatever the content is even if it's not a if it's a boring meme you notice that there is a meme yeah and then there's a content that you judge if it's interesting or not but it cannot stand only by you know one of them you need to yeah i need the two parts to be and also if like i don't know anything about this culture for example if i'm just you know staying in japan and not i don't know who drake is then if i look at the picture even if i read english and if i find it funny but that's not the most funny thing because i don't know the meme the drake doing funny dance yeah yeah so it's actually really interesting so it's really like convoluted but that's the thing i mean what i found because like when you speak like in communication then you will have normally there's the the basic idea is that you have an in some something that emits a message and there is something that receives the message that's the base the the low uh level of communication um but then if you speak like then through the internet or in memphis the memes that we're speaking now then it's a message that is out and some people of course they will receive it but it's not aiming to somebody specifically right it's not that you're it's not that you're aiming to that person but it's aiming to the network and some people will catch it and they will make their own process which is completely different from no this is what i'm arguing that is close to the gesture because then to work the mem it has to has more or less uh people need to understand the joke right people need to more or less make the same joke out of it uh it's not it's not an abstraction it's something that more or less all of these recipients are kind of like laughing because it's funny and then you need to be cultural as you said before you need to be culturally educated in that context otherwise you won't understand the joke so from that point of view what i'm saying that is a that's a gesture if the message will be just sustained as an abstraction and the people receive we will be more the case of art and people will receive it in different ways than my potential things in them then it's just maybe a gesture for the gesture but without recipient [Music] um is um [Music] well i don't know if it's gesture or not or what part is it's more about what part is gesture and what part is not uh but also like i feel memes are like haiku in japan because that's yeah yeah like basically you have the format and you have to do something within that format yeah how does it work the haiku what is the original one i don't know about the english one but the original one is basically you have uh five characters seven characters five characters and you have to have some words that refers to the season of the year you have to refer to the season season of the year i really i didn't know that because if it doesn't happen it becomes like another jar so you need to mention all the seasons or at least one season just one what you need to mention one season and also like they have some um phrases that are commonly used and if you use those words then you get more points because basically you're limiting more and more by using this like restricting to the format but you still say something interesting then you earn more points i mean like points like imaginary points so but there is nobody qualifying that but it's some kind of uh you know so like it's more like you know in the case of meme it's it's about you know if you're choosing drake or if you're choosing uh what are the common ones spider-man or whatever because you are limiting the format into something people already know so you can easily refer to but you have less space to play with right yeah i see what i mean see why you make the the technology there yes there must be people saying um so what are you maybe we can close here and then we can go for a second to backstage yeah so yeah thank you people uh watch i think next week we will do we will have a new guest will be somebody very very very interesting um i am actually curious it's not the same thing i pretend i don't know actually i don't know so yes stay in touch and please like the video and like subscribe to the channel thank you for that one subscriber that subscribed after that live stream okay thank you", "SlZNyLNFoxo": "okay so now we are live um we are on the same um page we are on the same page uh best practices dot yeah and i hope it's working fine um jorge has accidentally closed his streaming so now it's only on my side so hey guys hi there we're already live and it's recording i think yes so i i screw my my streaming by the way so now we just have now it's a streaming on the website because when we finish i just like you know because we are at the end we just like close things you know like you're with energy so i just closed everything and then i thought wow it's not control q i should not do control q everything was gone yeah no but everything but if you just close the tab you can still ah wait wait no no no because i closed everything so the the streaming was out okay a little bit yes how do you say when you go forward a little bit so i would watch some snippets and i did looked into a moment where we were talking about how not to be seen which i think it was uh referencing hidden style no yeah so it was it was it's nice to to yeah i could i didn't have the time to go through it all but it was nice that there were some moments that it felt very um provocative yeah this is very nice because i mean by the way this is the first time that we are sharing this space with somebody else so publicly this is so so exciting that you are joining us it's so super nice yeah actually we should we should give like introduction or something or we just do it like this i don't know i don't know who's watching this is the introduction yeah i don't know like do you want to say something it seems like you want to say something this is very funny because this is yeah it's it's impossible not to do and this is something that i'm getting more conscious that once i know somebody see let's say the streaming puts so much pressure on me because i cannot avoid like uh the function i cannot avoid trying to make it good i can otherwise try to make people like what i said like if i'm alone or if i'm more in a private environment i will care less so in a way then i will be more close to what i think is the best practices thing mm-hmm you're becoming like a person i was saying that in relation to like what is what you're supposed to do you know like this is the chat like now invite we invite one more person but is it that we're supposed to do a form a formal introduction is it good or wrong like it is very supposed to do something did you ever introduce yourselves when you were doing the best practices what i was thinking we never did it so make videos no one really knows who you are but it's lonely i think what we do is in the chat slowly we have this reflexive thing sometimes that to speak somewhere in the past or in the future is the way i see it and sometimes then i speaking or to now also in the past or the future up to myself in the past of the future because of their calving uh and that's that's that's yeah but then there is a reflective way to speak to not only to now also let's say when we do just normally the chat but then to try to introduce things if we use some text try to give the reference to the text um but this is a bit because if we we call something like uh backstage in a way in a way when we just start speaking i mean and we're recording everything apparently everything i think we have a lot of material but then we upload just like the the frameworks of the best practices and the chats but we're recording every time they now tell me we met online we are recording this so very often happens like is this gonna be uploaded the question you know well yeah unless it's live stream so that's the that's the difficult thing with live streaming you cannot avoid it it's going to be online it's already in the network so yeah yeah like maybe i we should ask something to joanna because she's there and but i don't know what to ask um yeah like i was thinking like because what jorge said uh like i was about to ask you know why we're doing this together but maybe that's like an introduction i don't know well maybe i think one thing we can certainly talk about is how our paths intersected um so i guess uh it all comes down to you now yeah it's points funny yes yeah well actually one thing that then that i'm curious is when when you're coming together like you you seem to still be using a lot of of a hydra of the live coding platform um and but what you do something the presence of the camera and multiple viewpoints of the camera it's also growing in your best practices so i'm actually quite curious about how much do you think about these tools how much i i know that from from other conversations we have at the point is that you don't have much of an agenda but at the same time you do have a sort of setup so i'm quite curious to learn more about that so now now i'm the one who asks a question it's good because also like the one of the ideas we had for this chat is to do q and o not q and a but questions and options so we just leave questions okay um and i think it's really good point you said because to be honest today i was quite annoyed with all these windows from jorge like you had like eight or nine different winters on live lab and i just had one on the corner and most of them were from jorge and i mean not annoyed but i found it's funny and there are like some ghosts that are not used anymore so it's like blank but it stays there but it's but it's like why not i quite like i quite like how you know thinking about interface the notion of interfacing uh it all comes down to squares which i think it's one of the things that have been mostly discussed in the past year because of so much of you know the interactions coming to these sort of streams where you're sort of you know would have to fit in this sort of frame um but then i quite like the fact that you leave the that you leave also this the ones that are somehow ghostly or that you also embrace the absence or the yeah i think that's that's less usual that's less um embraced i believe the way i see it is that like because i think now to and myself we have different workflows like that was from the beginning so like if i will uh like for instance today what we use in a ways now now to we'll use some uh hydra or some other platform that i'm using depending i don't know what is what he's using all the time but then then i will be using uh bdmx that it has all these small windows uh i think from the beginning we were like oh i was using and we still we do it but not every time because we change but like the way how we do it today in a way is very similar how we started that is like i use bdmx because i'm more comfortable with that then i will glitch through the vga interface and then but for instance today in my experience i was trying to do many many so i was trying to use hydra and bdmx at the same time and so it was it was way too much because then sometimes then i get lost in am i using the switcher or am i using the windows in my vga software who who is the pipeline which one is the one that i'm using uh so um but i think that the the workflow like today for instance like i was using as well like three different cameras that i try sometimes or like three four and but yeah i think it was long time ago since i was trying that so i think i was trying to do many of these brilliant ideas that i thought oh this is this will be this will be spectacular uh and then i have to deal also then with the with i cannot avoid comparing but like uh with the image that naoto is making and that's something that i that i could reflect today because then i will compare myself you know and to judge but in in in the sense then i will compare my image the image that i'm doing but that's not only the image because it's only it's a reflection of me you know like then i have to in a way to accept my desires and my limitations also uh so but what i'm i was sharing that is because today i have the space and at some point in the streaming i was using the text when i see is not working i have just 10 minutes my and then i just realized that actually i have the time to just say just start writing the things around the the idea of of this that i'm expressing and that uh released space for me so then i want i was not feeling any more uh bad in a way but then i just felt like oh okay it was like a meditative space uh but that was specifically today yeah like for me also like from my point of view like i really felt this not like tension but you know uh i know that you had a lot of things in your mind and then but at the end it was nice you know like you started writing and we kind of started to like i don't know what it is like breathing or whatever like we were just like with a voice we were like just moving and that was i think a nice way of kind of letting it go um and yeah for the text i i just wanted to ask you joanna like uh because i think one of the like i would say like a reference in terms of like the live code or any kind of performance the text then like you are one of the you know um i don't know what's the right word master of using text in the performance and like we're still like more like uh how how is it like ad hoc like we just open the text editor or like google docs and start writing things uh but uh yeah i just want to know i i don't know what what's the right question but maybe you can expand on it um yeah but it's it's crazy how actually when i was um going through the video from the recordings before i i stopped in the moment you were writing i was so curious about that so yeah i do think that i whether it's a feeling or not because i also think that i make a lot of my audiences um i ask a lot from them in terms of focus because um i think there's a level of immersiveness with the voice and you know um at the presence of the body but then when it comes to text and especially when it's so heavy on text which is oftentimes what i do then yeah i i think it asks a lot from our you know from everyone else in the room um but yeah i think it's also i also don't mind the fact that sometimes people fade away from the text and then when they come back they will encounter a specific word that they will connect with or they stay with so i'm also not expecting when it comes to text uh performances or um if that becomes also a bit more of a prominent element i'm not expecting everyone to always pay attention to that but i think it's quite beautiful when at least i hear in the audience someone repeating a word that somehow connected with them or if relationally if a piece of text then because it's together with another one also form some sort of you know connection so i think that's more what i find it interesting and yeah and also because maybe i can maybe it's also a way to stretch a little bit what we understand is technical languages and also what we understand as natural languages a lot of things that we spoke about like where we come from where do we go how languages how we become people with almost no languages because of how much of them we sort of incorporate throughout time and how you sort of feel like you que start questioning yourself in relation to what's your native language after you know connect or embedding yourself in so many of them um say i think there's many questions to do with text language and having that as as a within a performance and as as an action as you know as something that happens live and with others actually there was like one like funny moment when one of the like first live streams we did someone actually wrote in the chat what was it again like uh jorge can you do you remember like i would oh yeah i would love if you can uh tell me like how to use hydra with p5.js or something like that like it was like kind of like really like a uh just like a question if i can explain that um of course i didn't but i i just liked that text so i used it in the performance i mean the practice which was uh which was kind of funny also like because jorge was saying the word love and that text also had love like if you i would love if you could explain this so that was kind of interesting and i think that's the only participatory moment we had yeah the way the way how i go with text normally as like i did today is something will happen and then so this the text literally was saying something about like my frustration now literally will come there and then i'll let it pass and then slowly i will do a similar process when we were writing together then then i will just start taking words away so when it was something literal becomes something different but then i'm not searching for that just at the end it was something about the lake but it was not any spanish it was a word the everything that i wrote was like four lines in english but at the end was worth in spanish kind of that it was speaking about the lake and that's the way normally ho will jump uh i do often this process when we are without with the text that's my that's my going through text in the in the practice and another another aspect that i also find it interesting and that i don't think i explored that as much as other other performers i know is also the sound that comes from language and i think i play more with the silences and with the breathing but it's also quite interesting sometimes to if you work with people who explore more the voice how that also becomes a rhythm of its own i think in my case i would say that that's more present in the shape of typography because maybe of my graphic design background i like zooming into certain words and somehow connect with more of the central part of it where you just let yourself go through the the shapes the curves some some things that may not mean anything but somehow they also bring a lot to your side and they there's so much already in your visual history that makes you connect with those shapes and and um everything they they carry but yeah i actually you um you also don't know you sometimes do play music but that comes from sort of spontaneous things right oh you're muted i think now also is in a way to date this is today i felt also i have the space today to think like that in a way i felt responsible for putting music because i don't remember the first time that now just putting one one song so at some point i guess it's just it's kind of like i guess it's more me screaming like i need to i need to put some music i guess it's inside of myself because i remember the beginning also was very careful with the copyrights and stuff like that and then through it then through the practice then we know where we find a way how to make sure then not to get the copyrights uh then in a way we don't we make it work but then today because i was i have the reflection to actually have the space to i don't want to have the i feel like i don't want to have the responsibility to put it so at some point i just put it uh like the beginning i put something like a melrose place because it was in my head so like this this thing from melbourne's place from the 90s and it was while i was putting just the the chroma key in the background and it was like a song of 10 minutes and but then after then when and so and that was before we started practicing away or i mean i was not really with the computer i started like coding and started doing nothing so it was more just my back back but then after when i was in the mood and then i thought like okay maybe this is a bit too quiet which we call dancing because the music will easily introduce or induce the dancing then i thought like no i don't i will not do it because i feel like with responsibility yeah i see um yeah to be honest like i was experimenting a bit with uh like distorting sound so it was in my list today to like open another computer and play the music but like distort it so that uh maybe it can bypass the copyright but then in the end in the end i didn't do it because i think i was just too into what i was doing and uh it's also okay if i don't do it maybe next time i do it that's kind of the the how is how you see it how i see it at least and i think it's good that you mentioned a jorge that um this responsibility thing because yeah like this was not like my intention but also i know that this kind of you know it's yeah yeah yeah i think what you said is it makes sense and i was also feeling that but don't take this wrong don't take me wrong also because i think but i have this relationship with everything i guess this i have always this love-hate relationship with different things that's part of how i identify myself and i navigate through the world sony's like i think that is so so no valid this that i'm saying it's just because the same time that i'm saying because what i'm saying is in the practice i should i don't want to deal with these judgments uh because that's not the space in the i understand the practice in the space where i'm trying not to be jorge in a way and trying to bypass my consciousness through sometimes right uh so be they have the judgment to say like uh being responsible yeah uh that's part of my consciousness so this is so as valid as as is as is not valid for the practice but then the chat is display is the space where we try when we do this thing with this exercise confession the confession yeah also like we sometimes say that it's like the moment when you sit in a circle in a you know like a dance workshop and talk about you know what was the experience oh yeah those back in those good days exactly i so how how how has it been for you to to feel the body or to relate with the body in relation to the camera and in relation to the rhythms that are established through all the other activities that you do like coding or you know the visual part of things or the writing has there been anything you've been discovering that is particularly new or revealing um i can also imagine that the answer can be less um straightforward but i'm just curious to hear what what you've been feeling about that in relation to the body who's gonna go okay um i thought that that's that's natural so i wanted to break that but it's okay uh i can say something like i know the question was like more about the the development through the year because we've been doing for a year um but today like it was like what i was doing i don't know if you saw it but i put like a cursor and then i tried to move like a cursor on top of the desktop and then it it really felt i mean that's like really like a relation with relation to the the viewpoint the camera and i have to be really conscious about it and i think that's that happens quite a lot in the practice because it's not that we want to make it like nice in the frame but um but we are actually working with the square and you said like something about square frame but it's kind of funny because we kind of i think we kind of like it also like live lab interface is really square um but it's but it's like i think because we use like uh bdmx and uh hydra and it becomes something else yeah bdmx is so no friendly with the i because the last time i think i opened bdmx could be one month ago when i was in puff so i forgot completely that bdmx doesn't really like bdmx from bj so he's just a standard is 910 so then you have to do three things to the interface to find a place to just uh to make it right in a way so then yeah it was a live lab uh put this uh depend of how many windows are the the yeah the things are getting a certain it's more it's more than rectangular is more square than rectangular literally and and that's okay if i don't have if i don't work with vdmx i was thinking that just like doesn't complain with that but the way i think with the camera is because i think with the cameras i guess i would say that i will have insist more in that than naoto i think like literally putting more cameras like having obs ninja today a big part of like the first part is like trying to make the obvious ninja so like my phone work as a and because i didn't in some time it took me a while and then i have to deal with the frustration that i know this thing why i forget this thing and this whole experience but then the way how i experienced the cameras are in the construction of the yeah the the the way how the the body will appear or how they will configure itself in live lab uh directly uh because it has if i have different cameras like today when we were in the development at some point at the beginning i was using two different cameras so one it was taking my feet and the other one was taking my upper body and it was just by chance it was exactly mapping my body and we both were like well what was it and it was just exactly mapping but it was because there were just four windows at that moment if somebody will put another window in live lab then the squares will be rearranged and the grouping of my body will be not the same uh that's something that i i try a few times but then because that just adds many things in my uh setup and my just my the elements that i'm using then sometimes i'm consciously trying to say okay no just i use just one webcam in order to try to simplify my my doing but very of very often happens that i have a lot of things around let me just like change the topic uh completely like what what if we do the practice together like three of us like i don't know we can try at some point uh but like how would we do it you mean like you you want to try to speak about that how to make it that's that's what you're asking like how like not in terms of schedule that's that's not kind of how but i don't know yet yeah but like a format or like i mean we don't have to decide for the format but we have to have some kind of protocol right like we beat at 7 00 pm and do it until 8 pm or is it because that was the kind of the only protocol we had we meet on live lab we decided you know the starting time and just do it for one hour well today it was two hours um but that's basically it and we didn't never said we're going to use hydra or vdmx but it just like naturally appeared and if it's like three of us like would we do it the same or should we do something differently what do you think joanna i think i didn't have an answer i think i have an answer but i would like to hear what you what do you think um yeah i i'm not i don't know how it would yeah um i think on one hand one needs time to you know to fill the space and to get into a specific mode um so i think one hours feels like what you need for for things to to yeah to find its own to find their own way but at the same time i'd be quite curious a while ago we discussed what it would mean to also do things a secret asynchronously and leave something for someone else and a bit like these ghost ghosts sort of um presences and like that got me really curious um you know um yeah it's a bit like arriving at a stage where there's some props and some things around and then you know that something happened before you you just see those traces and you sort of imagine how you connect with that and either you know continuity or discontinuity you're not even quite sure what you know how that happens but yeah that was one thing we've discussed a while ago that got me very curious yeah and what is your option know what i thought it would be just live live because then live left and it it doesn't matter the time i will need five hours normally because of my setup is very demanding but uh but no yeah because i have a personal because i how to say this because i'm i'm partly in and out of these things uh how wait i'm gonna try to organize what i'm trying to say is that yes like uh i think the process like the ho ho joanna uh suggests like it's something very interesting to work uh like as in a way like traces you know like working with something that you do or did someone do in time meaning that you don't have to be their present but then let's say it's a video let's say something that other ones can use um then it's then it has to be then then it has to be some there is something else you know then it's not like this thing that i have in my head of best practices because it's not symmetrical like if the if if your presence is not there uh it's already limit limiting in the framework oh i understand the practice is uh it's something else the there is not something that i will how i understand the practice right now but that's how i think so either definitely i'm not saying it's not it will become it will be super interesting and then working more if you think choreographically actually that it makes more sense that the way how you work and you create choreographies then you because that will define actually part of the elements so say that we have to work with some traces that you have left for us then we have to make sense of that and it will frame things in in certain way but i think that would be really really interesting but that would be a different exercise i think because in the exercise of the practice no matter how many people are i think the time and the space i think is very i think both sharing that space the people who are in space sharing the space and the instability and the latency and all the problems of the i think is something that is it makes the space uh it shares the uncertainty of the off of the moment i have two options um well one thing is like i don't know if it has to be symmetric i mean or the question is like does it have to be the practice like maybe that's what i was saying like but i think we could be super super interesting but it's just i guess because we come together like once i mean we have been talking the last weeks a lot like a lot of chats we have to lose a lot of chats so this is more i guess this is in my head kind of like me putting a lot of uh screws in my head is like i'm very into like defining what is the practice so what i think is the practice this is in a way that then i don't understand this as a practice right uh so maybe in the in the next well as a next project or whatever like uh i'm not trying to overwhelm you but maybe it's something not practice that we can propose to do something today that would be super interesting because also that goes more than the idea of like archiving you know i mean like think i'm thinking just like when you were saying that i felt like in dance what the one of the ways of composing and dance is like you limit your space let's say and you live in your mo you limit the things like dancers and choreographers as we spoke some time ago in the chats like they're afraid basically of movement in a way that's that's the fear of the dance of the choreographer is the movement itself so that's why you're trying to tame it as much as you can uh because then you can you can be free through through understanding what are the what are those motions what is the motion that you want to use so i think then working through archiving um that will be certainly something very uh i don't know more interesting but it will be more in a way structure it's something that it will demand more a different exercise cognitive exercise for me at least i can say i can try to use the strategies to how to tackle the thing the the every time you know if i know then this week will be now also giving something and then it's you and me or the other way around and certainly then i will have to then i will tackle the exercise with different strategies i have another option uh well it's not really option but uh i just wanted to say that today i was using some recordings from uh like other sessions one is from another practice that i was playing the video with the cursor and text the the code and also when i was outside at the beginning i recorded part of the live coding and i was like just repeating like replaying again and again and again so i don't have to code but as if someone's coding it's just happening and the other one is uh from yesterday i had a like a session with uh floor floor de fuego and we i made it like a recording of the code so i was actually using that live coding like happening as a replay and i was using that texture in the background or on myself to work with it so that was actually already happening yeah i think there's so many ways to hybridize those different temporalities and um yeah provide some hooks and ways to hook into that kind of material um yeah so i yeah i think that so basically what to to wrap up with the question i i would basically say that there's probably a way to combine the liveness and the the momentum with maybe other materials or other ways of thinking how to pass it on um yeah i was there's also something that i was um that i wanted to ask you did you so when you started doing the best practices um did you think of an audience because first you're doing it live right so you could just record it and not share it right so you do put it out there um what is there anything you expect or is this the fact that you're both performers that makes it natural to do that or i'm just curious to hear a little bit about that i don't remember i remember why to know what happened let me try to remember i think we didn't have a yeah but this is part of like in a way i think i think the format works because in a way we don't have a purpose like it's something that it doesn't have a purpose more than just expressing the expression so i guess we started it was not live streaming it was just recordings and then we put them out i don't think it was yeah we always put them out uh since one year ago so the stream certainly changed a lot of the of the it's weird because we always put them out there i don't think there has been one that we'd say like oh my god we just cannot put this out so we always just put them out and so in that's to say that the live streaming is not adding anything to more than just changing i mean having the i mean the privacy the little privacy you know when you decide to upload it is gone you know like there is no control of of that but we never used that yeah so that and then i think the people who watch i don't think we never have really spoke about like for who are we doing this i think um how we spoke about this like the audience the audience yeah i think that's something we started to talk about like where like how kind of more like how to advertise how to promote the work that's certainly about audience but it's not like uh more like audience in terms like curators and stuff no that sounds uh wrong but i think also there's something in the title the best practices that you know usually when something is when you claim something is best you usually just there's usually a projection right so i think it's already in the title in the provocation that you're making um you know and and i think there's something to do with the fact that there's something quite interesting with the easiness within which we do things online on one hand we are maybe exposed to you know millions of people on the other or our bots or you know whatever sort of agents are there in the world wide web but we're yeah on one hand we're hyper exposed on the other hand it's just so much of everything it's like a sea of data right we're like just one more drop in the ocean so there's also something there that is eases everything down you know maybe no one will even watch it right and if they do yeah i don't know maybe that's maybe we're lucky uh and so maybe they are obviously they are unlucky that they watched it yeah one way or another um so yeah i wonder if if the reason why it felt like it it came so natural to upload things is also the fact that you know it's i don't know it's just um you don't even know if it will ever or you know how who it will reach to start with yeah i think there was no like strong um intention like we didn't really discuss but we just said you know if there's something wrong we can take it down but otherwise we just put it and i'm fine with it like i'm fine with putting like work in progress or sketches online so that was easy but yeah if i asked yeah i also think there was like something that i think was clear in the beginning is like we want into our to have a massive archive i think that's something that we thought like if we if we want to do it if we start a process i guess we said like just we are let's have an archive like a massive archive uh of this so in a way i think that's the only thing that i can think back then that we thought is like you know just because we were anyway doing it before recording it like a tv program kind of like some we talk about these ideas right maybe you can say a bit of this because we talk about this tv yeah we just like had an uh idea of like meeting every uh like same day of the week and uh same time so it becomes like a tv show that we will be there for uh one hour and then that's it like that i think it was really clear from jorge that uh we will like you know whatever the result is we'll like cut everything at uh like after one hour uh so it's like a it's like a tv show but we didn't really start it with live streaming because yeah just to have less stress but so instead we just put it online afterwards so maybe that was like a compromise at first yeah i think so i also thought i wanted to say something in respect to that that was i think just the idea of for like the way this is personal the way how i think actually how i i see a spectator nowadays is i expect somebody who jump through the through the through the through the streaming so in purpose then we propose something that is like seven hours long uh that's something we discussed without them we talked this and i guess from january when we start proposing this format it was long first it was just something that it came like this because the streaming has to be long in order to just have one url let's say but then also part of the things that we talk is um in the idea of this active audience that it means that through that if somebody comes it needs to have some active uh presence in the sense of trying to find through the glitches and through the things that we do things that resonate like in a way i think similar to the process when you mention about the phones and then you spa the way how you will zoom in and do this kind of process uh that is not literally trying to say to you this but it's just and your words use this sensuality of the element uh to for the person to do their own work uh with his own representation identities and so on um but then then uh i i imagine somebody going i guess as you did today party like you know i just gonna jump here here i'll i take i stay here 10 seconds oh by surprise now also he's talking about this i will stay here longer and then just here here here and that's the way ho i imagine a spectator like going through seven hours like uh yeah do you ever see yourselves going back to the archive and having to do something with it we do we we use it sometimes we use we we use it back we use it like we use it so you make this archive live that's part of like that that's the way i think we spoke of these things i think that we said that we're trying to make the archive live in a way so then we use sometimes and we try many times in the conversation before we start doing the few times we try to start we set in the in the development let's use the archive and we said and we tried to do it and then i guess we end up doing it but not in the way how we will tr let's say as a research you know like really let's try to go through the archives and it happens naturally in puff when i was in france sometimes that we were putting in the back uh sometimes there are some archives yeah from the past recordings and also like from the chat like this this round we play it again because it's more interesting because a lot more interesting but it has another aspect because we are always talking so we can catch words all the time um yeah and also like that really reminded me of uh one of the first ideas i had when we talked about this tv show style that we do it uh every week i was thinking like just record it in advance like for one hour and just play it back um as if i'm live so we don't know actually if we are like each other is like live or not which it probably doesn't make sense because if you talk to them and if they don't reply then probably it's like recording or something wrong but if you're like really into the flow then sometimes you don't notice that if it's like a recording or not actually something that happened to me makes me think of a performance i forgot the reference but uh yeah it's i and i haven't watched it but i was told about this performance where you see someone on stage talking to you and then this person leaves the stage and you carry on listening to the voice but then it goes from live to recording and then you see the person suddenly in the audience and you know speaking over the recording and there's there's it's interesting i think it's so much more about what your expectations about the medium and the format are and how that tricks you at times yeah um yeah yeah the way i mean because this is something that that we are doing this partly also like this is we talk about these things that it has to be a lot with the time and the space so that's why like for me the live aspect has to be a lot because it just is it just put the vulnerability on top and because it's true there's so many times they're just glitching happening the glitches happen like between if there is latency or if there's a voice there is a lot of feedbacks uh in the voice uh it's very funny how the four times happens and then we hear something let's say that we because we are busy doing different things that we are not paying attention to what the other one is doing and then say i heard naoto's voice and then i will try to answer but it's just actually just some recording or maybe just his latency he's using something and so in a way it have it's very much in line with what you're saying with that performance i don't know it's it's but it's our intention is not to trick people or not to play with that but it's it's more random but sometimes like i mean that's like sometimes i try to trick you okay but sometimes uh like i will say it's not that and i never said yeah it happens uh yeah i think like the as different things in the practice like representation politics and other ones sometimes then i will just try to then trick you uh and then i'm so naughty and then i was like and then i just leave it and then i just go back and like they're just different things are just passing by in the practice and um so you say that you've done been doing this for one year yeah like this format is like started like last july i think but we started like meeting okay uh in last april yeah okay and do you do you have any future plans or it's all as open as it started if i speak by myself but for myself then from based on what we speak very often in chat then by the way people are following the chat they can go back in the chat and see oh he's lost so maybe i can say oh yeah yeah but it's okay this is part of it oh i missed the timing to say it you can continue we're trying to do like uh to maybe make making the process more visible because we believe that there is already a process that is valid in a way uh through digital and dance so we think this is an option that is in a way is clear enough through the confusion if i dare to say it uh so then somebody someone uh can go through uh so therefore i think we have been trying to speak like how then we gain some visibility how can we extend this without losing then the core the pureness purity of the practice i think it's really hard because this is something we all like often talk about um these days that we want to have kind of exposure not you know uh well okay i say i i want to be famous so i try to promote my work um but also it's not like it if that becomes the object to objective then that's not what we want so and i think also like kind of interesting word i said uh i said interesting word uh like a few months ago that sometimes like when i make images i want to make it like instagramable in a way that so i can you know take a screenshot later and put it on instagram and that becomes like you know like a kind of pressure that at one point in the practice you have to make something nice and that's not something we are aiming for and i think that's the same for like uh grant writing or you know working with institutions that then if you you're not you know like serving for them but if this becomes some kind of burden for us then that's probably not good so we have to kind of balance these two aspects of the purity of the practice and the visibility or whatever we can get from people yeah but but i think like we we haven't spoken of like i think we speak like in the future then we see it like spaces to uh go more in depth in like it archive is one that's something that definitely like that would be so interesting to work with you as you know then like this this is one like to understand what does the archive mean during in the process uh and the other one is to in a way then because this this idea that in their understanding they are calving as in a way is performative still is an active archive in a way so but then the other one is as well then writing which is basically or making sense of it rationally through language based uh so then that's what we do through the pro to the chat basically and then in the last i will say the last two weeks we have been we met maybe two times three times per week we spent more than one hour i think the la sometimes we met three times per week more than one hour to just talk and talk and talk uh trying to make to i guess build concept uh to shorten the paths uh to name this a blob to use words to to yeah just to create concept and try to to go farther in and yeah in the concept i guess you have to make a dictionary i feel like a dictionary but we started working with hashtag right in the chat page that you made we start working with hashtags what would you what would you think is that a hashtag will how would you can you use that one word like how would you define your experience with us in this chat today in a hashtag oh wow i have to hush i have to hashtag it um what a girl like at least i know it's hard at least at least a hashtag can be long which is nice you can almost write a sentence out of it so that's cool that's good that's on my side um you don't have to answer it i'll believe it you have three seconds you have to be smart it's a good no i i no i don't think i i i'm gonna say anything to too impressive but i do think that it's been um i think it's been great the discussions we've been having um especially when it comes to presence and what it means to share that presence um and i think the struggle between having some having to follow some protocols whether we want or not we you know like i can only be here otherwise i i disappear you know like so that we are constrained by all these things and but at the same time and we know that there's all these best practices for you know being in the camera being in the frame etc etc and i think it's been quite interesting have to rethink how to liberate oneself from me but also oftentimes just having to acknowledge the the constraints and the conditions so it feels like almost an endless situation um and there seems to be always some unknown factors that keeps us going um and it's probably because of the situatedness of the practices as well that they happen here and now and they are very much in real time so i totally failed on the hashtag that was a long hashtag okay yeah awesome so i think we can know yeah yeah so thank you for coming uh i'm just gonna switch off the the live streaming but uh thank you and uh yeah um if you're watching there are two viewers i don't know if it's actually two of you maybe uh but thank you for watching please like the video and subscribe to the channel okay thank you so much", "wafVx8RiDeE": "oh hello the floor is already warm i would say we are already talking uh and yeah let's go this is the beef this is the beef i have a beef with web design in our academies what the is happening you mean i'm a beef with this beef like like meat no because it's like you're like you're like trying to say that you have this no like this like a beef like a rapper you know against someone yeah with this academy well our academies when they start doing web when the web design thing you know because this is in a way can you actually show it on like here uh i have to yeah yeah yeah but allow it yeah it should be fine to do it now because i need to first find it um instagram i don't know what this like now like a new trend that basically like non-functional website but not like non-functional not in a sense that we do not not our kind of non-functional but it's just like a trend that everyone does something that is not functional yeah because it seems it seems that it's kind of like following um yeah because before in the in the conversation before we arrive yeah it seems like um [Music] is not that somebody is trying to do take let's say best practices in web design as a strategy of uh so take best practices and web design and then in a way deconstruct these best practices and then reorganize nothing not with gestalt principles but just more hijacking these principles in order to criticize the web design industry and so on so it's not in that in that spirit but instead it is just yeah i don't know please help me i'm just finding this please add something there i'm about to share this yeah i don't know um i i have problems with this and i can name like a specific studio how did this look at this okay i found it okay okay i found it so why why they're doing this and this is so this is gonna be on my share of screen sure so this is already in my computer you see this can you see this yes yes it's rotating so but then i'm opening this from my story in instagram so it's something that juan pablo plaza is a friend of mine is working on and this is coming from the hisk which is kind of like a high institute of constant or something in in flanders uh oh they have that's not sure yeah because i thought dot edu is impressive mostly in the us no but this is like and this best of times actually i didn't know it was best sometimes it's the best best time twice better than the last one yeah because we we also have this which i think this isn't this is very nice and also the content they produce is very interesting um but they also have the worst of times yeah like but but the thing that i have like my beef with these kind of pages is like i try to open this on my phone they use this fonts like you see like these kind of fonts i don't know how to call it i think it's yeah cursive i guess yeah receive fun yeah and then on top of that they put it to rotate in 3d so this just makes impossible to read this in your screen in your phone and the actual text is okay well mix it which is yeah but it's not so bad but yeah but in somehow like uh yeah so this is just one example i think there was an application that we did with naoto for something that maybe we should not mention here but then they wouldn't that was one of the worst i i don't i don't i don't know to share that uh yeah if people follow the chat in the back then well then i can share something else i mean i'm not going to mention that once that specific one but uh let's see until we don't hear about the answer once they answer them we are unsure yeah so this is what we made when we made it i made yesterday best practices chat and i have some fancy animation and the cursor in the back and the hydra in the back um yeah but you know it's it's still functional you can you can read it right i don't know what you think but maybe text is a little bit distracting but but but then the question is here because i think i would always say in a way if i understood you well is that you're trying a way then how to use like best practices in web design in the way who i i i said at the beginning more using the best practices and aesthetics in certain way that are deconstruct to not uh so it kind of has a as a criticism or something that is kind of sarcastic partly uh something that looks good that it looks overly good in a way right it does yeah i mean i don't know uh let's see some like really bad example well i shouldn't say bad because i know some people working on it but this dude what do you think like what do you think just looking at this website i want to see wait like can you go to get there on experiment or ally that they hand their little hand what no just the little hand that sometimes becomes yellow like there yeah this is so weird yeah actually my project was listed here before but uh they somehow took it out so i can so that maybe that's the beef i'm having um so yeah i mean i mean it was actually even worse i think uh no it still animates actually this wow this thing you know that's that's the next level website you know um i don't know if so i will skip the one that um we are waiting for because that's not nice to say um but i i know that the guys who made this website and they always do really like yeah kind of websites yeah but i think like if we go back to this idea of like i think web design is maybe maybe juwan is trying to do these things of you know like what i'm trying to say is that i think this is is something that is very very trying to use web design or trying to deconstruct web design like through web through best practices wow what is this this is very nice i mean this is another another website made by the same uh same studio and he says yeah i mean i don't know it looks okay actually i was expecting something more somewhere but um i mean i mean nothing against these people um yeah can you go back can you go back to the beginning to the top to the top wait which top this is just just a bit of that and this rotating thing and i think the rotating thing is a new thing new that's a cute thing always you have to always rotate yeah i mean this is this is readable it's it's okay i mean it functions yeah it somehow functions ultimately like i i hate medium i don't know if you use medium but yeah rude it's it's it's also like you know kind of um they're not as like progressive but they are like you know also like their new logo and like how it looks like i feel like it's kind of pursuing that non-functional or you know disturbing the web design in a way it's just like a blog site that you just post text i think i think the the challenge when you're i mean when somebody deals with functionality that that's not that in a way that that's not the domain of art we have been speaking of this before like in a way art is not functional it it i mean it is granted in a way like yeah we said this like because art in a way let's say i said that i believe that then art doesn't have to be political that doesn't mean that is not i mean saying that it doesn't have to represent politics or stay in politics it it doesn't mean that it will not uh it will wow wait let me finish what i would say and it doesn't mean that uh it will not uh inspire what will said or uh evoke uh politics so yeah again but so then again like if so art i think art doesn't have to be political in itself i think so art you just have to deal with art itself but that doesn't mean that it cannot inspire politics or things uh yeah i think that makes sense right does that make sense to you the art itself is not political yeah that doesn't mean that cannot inspire politics you know the difference is that i'm not telling you how you should think yeah i mean yeah in the end it's it's up to the viewer who receives it i mean or it can't be political but it's not politics i don't know yeah yeah yeah that's what i'm that's what i'm trying to say in different words yes yeah but it's then it's up to the person to just deal with that and not the art itself art it deals with art and that's it it's just expression of expression it's not the concave i mean it depends i mean no no i think it doesn't have to deal with the content in a way like i think that it's just the potentiality in itself but there are different kind of uh yeah but there are different kind of things that people do i believe that now from from what i speak in this close to the practices that um it has to be free and not functional at the moment the discursive like say if because we work with repre with the performance essay or live streamings or dance so like a time space say that in that time frame those is in that time frame but i'm speaking about no like perform motif space that the art itself doesn't have to deal with anything more than just being art and expressing expression basically but then that doesn't take away that before or after that we do like in the chat after for instance and before with the development then you talk about it right yeah that's that's when i mean art doesn't become political in that place but we can um in a way in a way in a way i mean we cannot we cannot i would say that we avoid politics in the practice but i will say also that we is very that we cannot avoid politics when we speak in the chat because you speak as yourself uh so it's impossible that that because then we deal with identities politics and a part of that then we are also uh using uh yeah semioti uh we have words and then it's going through the web so the other person has to look at you and you look asian but what are you saying or you know like all any kind of these things that we cannot say like then so then not dealing with politics we do the chat although we don't we are not speaking literally about politics they they are in in ours in in our talking like if i say that maybe it doesn't do the moment then to say like then that we are start believing or i start thinking that that we will start doing uh i will start proposing a burning a hunting on those who are not best practicing contemporary dance followers anyone who is not following the my youtube channel that it has three subscribers i think maybe uh so anyone who is not actually checking you have two i have two oh my god one of them maybe it was maybe there was there were three and one just unsubscribed because the word oh no that's very sad um so yeah but that's to say that my i think my intention is to burn anyone who is not thinking like me right in my soul subscribe to my channel please or or you might be burned [Laughter] once the power gets to me you might be burned [Music] so wait there was one website that you showed there was one that you showed that was very extreme not the node but it was before it was before node and before i know it oh yeah with the text that was like was very extreme you can't show that that was very extreme uh yeah actually i didn't apply and the deadline is deadline was already passed like a few days ago but they it seems they still uh you can still apply it seems dear humans what can you go back what you can go back for it's for a second yes yeah but i think it's at some point when i read dear humans uh let no no no in the in there yeah just let it there for a second just just stay there for a little bit in in the uh home page it could be it please say something like that this is in austria yeah um oh yeah there is the text is here we are humans here dear humans and then you can't read because the blob is coming and crunch why they do this this is a good example of this it's the it's the the marquee right like the the traditional scrolling text but uh i don't know like you know people used to like it um so you know it seems like the the application is still up somehow so you can still apply um although the deadline was uh the ninth um i'm trying to find another page that could be interesting i mean but i mean i don't know um oh yeah this is i think i think we the exposure point like that was like yep so but i think i didn't i finished what i was trying to say that is i think when you deal with functionality so when you uh when you use a tool that it must be functional or you need to create a structure that is functional say a website it's just a bundle of functions and stuff um [Music] wow so this is mac this is the other extreme yeah that just like you know shows in front of your eyes like all the time you know just keep trying to expose something to your eyes and i found it funny is like um there's this uh coffee brand in japan i'm so good i want to buy an ipad now and they also do like similar things you know for this coffee now it's it's a little bit humble compared to apple but still like i found it's kind of kind of funny that they have like similar but this looks good this looks very uh refreshing like the uh the coffee next to apple look very refreshing like that's the modern people need it's very same i'm using that yeah but then yeah so i think what i was trying to say is like although i'm complaining about these websites and these practices i have my beef with this but with this art because this is the the thing is is art the one who is trying to jump yeah it's like i see it from coming from art institutions who are somewhat not working with technologies let's say it's not their thing but they have a website right so they in somehow now it seems they all of them they is kind of they start all of them at the same time doing these things um and i just don't understand but anyway so i mean also our artists are not designers that's another thing yeah but then it's yeah wait wait because so is what i'm trying to say is that so i have the problem i have this problem but at the same time i recognize that trying to deal with that which is in a way what i'm trying to do when when i when i propose this when i do designing art what i'm trying to do is something that is similar that is dealing with functionality so when somebody's in dealing with web design and is trying to do an artistic process through design methodologies or design things i think it's a a very difficult work uh uh yeah i just i want to say that i think it's a very difficult thing but i respect very much when somebody is if somebody's trying to do if somebody is really trying to take the time to let's say uh using and deconstructing all these gestalt principles and all these design uh best practices to do something actively critical or yeah for in that framework i'm just checking joanna's website this is johan yeah that's scrolls not vertically but still you can read what the body is there yeah unless they don't overlap oh yeah but you you still can read when yeah you just have to you know click on it and then um oh i don't know if this is something yeah it's it's it's clean and it's functional and i like that the font is bold so they can be so weird because the font is the same phone that i use in my website it's so weird i found it so weird i use my website i find it very weird and also the colors that you choose kind of the same colors in the font you see um but yeah i mean this thing of the designer is not an artist and it's a bit this is this is always i mean i have been doing this as a research for five years now actively like like designing art and so then this is a topic so at the beginning then i was really saying that you know very openly and i still have i'm somewhat in that there i guess but what i encounter a lot during that process in saying that a designer is not an artist because in my understanding in ways yeah because the designer it has to deal a lot with organization actually you know structures uh designer has to deal a lot with that and time and structures of time and effectiveness [Music] there is a clear goal very often but this is and then in a way like in the the designer solve the problem and then the artist create the problem or the framework to think upon right to create a framework to philosophize uh so there the the nature of like both big chunks are at at the first glance are completely different but that's that's not to say that there are not people who are trying to cross over from side to side uh and yeah i see well yeah i mean that kind of reminded me of you know what martin was saying about the dance and uh dancer and choreographer and you know what how he said how did he say like choreographer hates movement or something like that because yeah i know he's scared like he was he was he was mentioning like they are next actually and i really like that because he says like architectures and something that uh he thinks i i i start i i was pretty i wanted to study the architecture but then i ended up dancing and but so and he says there that our architect architects are afraid of space i think a mess or something of mess yeah it could be wait there was wait one because they maybe make something the way they say you're saying that architects they deal with space no they deal with time on space basically space over time space over time yes yes yes yes and the and then and and dance will do the opposite it will do it will that it will deal with the space no time over a on space right that's a choreographed choreographer right there's a choreographer yeah yeah yeah no dance but the choreographer yeah yeah and then and then he says but what was that then they are in the architect will be afraid of this yeah the architect will be afraid of mess and then the choreographer in a way is afraid of mo of movement yeah yeah choreographer is afraid of which is true because you're afraid yeah it's true it's very interesting to think yeah yeah yeah yeah that was that was really interesting because that's something i didn't expect but yeah and but kind of in a way it makes sense yeah i was thinking that that was i think i shared this with you at some point when i proposed choreographies for other like on with other people let's say i invite other dancers then i will um invite someone who [Music] what i was trying to buy where was trying to say that no i think i'd lose what i was trying to decide okay then i have a question yes and then what is uh something that what designer is afraid of um now because then i think the architects will be afraid not of the mess but of the space because the mess is a big thing i'm not sure but i'm thinking just trying to think you know because then thinking of the designer what the designer will be afraid of i think the designer deals with structuring right so the designer in a way he will be in a way afraid of this mess true i mean but what does what does web designer have to do you know what is funny i remember in in four or five years ago when i type i don't know if it's now the same but when i was using my iphone if you maybe you can check in your phone now because i don't have mine here if you type artist it will be like an artist emoji but when you type a designer it was somebody uh with a rule no what was what no like an architect it was a helmet or something like that that was five years ago and now i and i put it in facebook because i thought it was very funny that was the definition by the emoji um i don't know it doesn't even show it with artist no before it was like a like an androgynous person with a flash on the head on the face and wait because maybe i would like to show that this is what like in facebook that was should be four years ago is that kind of can i find that without going scrolling in japanese i can see that artist becomes like the yeah like the painter this yeah oh so dirty yeah yeah yeah and then the on the designer let's see designer no there's no emoji for that yeah before it was it was like an architect uh emoji if i'm not wrong that's funny because i think like i think the designer might be afraid of not knowing maybe because a designer like you know design is some in a way like the artist is a designer the architect is a designer like design comes to any aspect of life in the sense of yeah it has to deal with uh you have if you think for instance movies they're one of the most complex uh genres of art then you have a designer for every every suit field you have a set designer you have a production designer you have like there is all of these designers because and each of them they deal with production and effectiveness basically [Music] in a way it seems to me like my brother for instance he studied uh how is called uh yes he willing him yeah civil engineer no not civil engineer but the one that deals with production what is that one uh effectiveness and method like making things in area industrial industrial in engineering in general uh yeah the one who deals with productions production and but then my brother was telling me that i think it is a inside joke within engineers that they said okay so you are the one who know uh a lot a little about a lot because is in a way is the designer of engineers you know like he can work in every field because he has to pass through all the the different like clusters of engineering but he's not really like a civil engineer or like computer engineer and i'm saying this in relation to the designer like the designer you can do graphic design there are some you can apply it it's very applied it's applied with within aesthetics i guess on functions in general but is a it's like a you have i think in a way like god is an if there's a god is a designer artist designer how to call that is something that it has to deal with like an overview of things that there's always design and things there's always the structuring otherwise we live in chaos i i cannot say who's going to be the guest but maybe we can talk about it on thursday it could be um actually that would be so interesting because our guest is somebody who works with sound with uh with webs uh on coding practices yeah uh they'll be very interesting but in the meantime i i know what uh web designers are afraid of this is probably what are what are web designers afraid i think that's the internet explorer about internet explorer yeah like when i thought about it i think it's kind of a stupid joke but at the same time it kind of makes like interesting questions because you know it's still funny it's still there it's it's crap and it's funny because it's funny yeah yeah it does what you don't want you know like everything is wrong on internet explorer or even safari is kind of wrong um but maybe that's you know kind of something that we can associate or relate to our practice but the the thing with internet explorer is like it serves you when you're coding as the threshold you know if it works in internet explorer so a mini moon should work in an internet explorer from there is fine it's like the bottom line so it's like you're aiming not for the best like say by like best practices you need to make it work you know in terms of uh responsiveness and this kind of things uh thinking on internet explorer you know in my in my and and the school they were teaching me you know like make sure you know a part of all the cool things that you want to use with javascript or things that you want to put fancy make sure that it will be responsive that was from the first semester you know it must be fun air responsive phone tablet computer and all of them good so here's the internet explorer that i installed on this virtual machine uh wow i can take a look at how it is how it looks like with my new website actually that's uh something i didn't think about this looks very uh this looks great me and is it connected to internet oh no content uh okay because this is a windows server so i have to do something why why why like [Music] keyboard mapping is wrong space juices that's sure add as an exception okay this is really cool i think i mean i can still read it it cannot be okay it's not bad you can still read the text at least you know that's great i think that i mean that could be a strategy to navigate like uh practices you know we want to go back to the idea like working websites together and then build something this could be a strategy because it deals with aesthetics in in the way who i mean we don't have to deal with the institution in a way so say like internet explorer is the one who is dealing with that and so then we don't have to yeah i think it's a good way to uh bypass complexity with the aesthetics uh bypass complex aesthetics uh okay i don't know if i yeah because there's no aesthetics here is that because they're not no but not yeah but they're still they have their aesthetics that there is they there is like there is the i mean the thing is it has a really well-defined aesthetic which is basically you cannot use anything that is using i don't know iframes or modern i don't know it's just but because of that then everything looks very flattened no so i think i think this is brilliant i think this is brilliant that internet explorer is it could be a way to hijack part of the or to bypass the aesthetics doesn't mean that we have to do like an internet explorer you know i'm not saying that but it's just hijacking through internet explorer then we can play because otherwise it means that the complexity of proposed the website in a in the way we think it just means i hope it's just such a it's such a project you know it's just something that is just to go for maybe years because then you deal with aesthetics and functionality and this is just very complex um so but then instead we can bypass the aesthetics through something that's what i'm saying the institution in a way like internet explorer is the institution in that in that sense like the aesthetics are being imposed by the institution so it's i mean i would i will put the example of the with the symmetry group in short like and yesterday we have in the symmetry group a proposal of somebody to improv propose uh in the performing art form in france to propose a meeting uh in puff so open for people and then we were thinking that it might be a bit complicated for different reasons because talking about asymmetries and politics are very sensible topics uh and then at some point somebody said like what if we invite a class say the i don't know gender class some class who already are studying something in path you know instead of like selecting tokens of letting by known colors of like you know instead of like saying this is a proposition uh just taking an institution so bypassing the problem with the institution and then just take the institution inside of path without saying that this is right or wrong but then we don't have to deal with the institution that's what i'm bringing this back to the internet explorer because internet explorer exists still and it has no combat yeah yeah it does yes sorry and then but then we can try then other versions also like you know internet ex seeing internet explorer as the institution that just then we bypass the aesthetics through the or not bypass i would say more like we hijack aesthetics through them um let's like we can think internet explorer as um art space without a curator like what without the curator no but they are curating in a way what is it missing it's a is it a director that is missing that we can hijack because if if it's self-contained with you know art director and you know marketing and everything contained as uh well probably our space is less contained but then we can apply yeah i see i think the way i think maybe i understood or maybe i understand you're wrong that but i think it worked it's like internet explorer is like the gallery where the director went for holidays and never returned so it stayed back in the 80s so so it's an institution that still exists and it has support and structure web space and all these things but the director never came back so yeah so i think there is not a creator but this is the director for god it was running uh yeah it's true yeah it's nice that you said it's like a gallery because it's really concrete and you know it's it shows it exhibits something so that's a good analogy i think um then the cool thing is like but there is there is still the minimal thing works say in the case of the chat uh uh the best chat uh that glitched me in the page for the chat the text was shown but not the videos um but this is something that we have to then we deal with that afterwards because if what we're trying to say is that um yeah wait maybe this is a bit confusing hmm how to no because i'm trying to i i i'm almost thinking like kind of in a methodology how to go iterative through something like that they might be because in the way how we did it right now just from testing was we built in a platform that is like say the state of the art of or in the web so something that we can use javascript something like this and it's done using libraries and all these kind of things and then we're trying to open the page through internet explorer and then the text and this kind of things work but then other things didn't work uh yeah so then in in the iterative process could be then to go to internet explorer and maybe just kind of take part of this say funds or some of the things and bringing them back into the page try them again and uh and then see what happens there also might be interesting to test other versions of internet explorer or netscape or something or other things but i like that i mean but i started liking this a bit as the romantic again as the romantic idea of the internet explorer as an institution as a gallery as the space where the with the director went for holidays and never returned i really see this like really tall big white ball fat guy who went for a holiday and never returned he got lost in his own greedy in malta i don't know um yeah the uh it i think is is a it's a could be it could be a strategy uh yeah i think this is maybe here using important to mention that i think what it works in this framework of what it works well speaking is because we don't we don't want to um get lost trying to solve political issues say the aesthetic as like the problem that you start mentioning at the beginning my beef with web design and art academies that's a political problem that jorge has with uh with the with art academies and web design uh that is me and but i i also understand the art and my art like or practice doesn't want to deal with politics therefore i don't want to propose a solution like in terms of design problems solve these i'm not trying to solve this because i'm an artist or identifying myself more close to an artist nevertheless then it's still within structures say in this case with the web design that we can hijack methodologies aesthetics say in that sense internet explorer that we can use in our doing and then we don't have to deal with the politics and the heaviness of of the institution of saying like those are the right aesthetics uh because that's too heavy for that's i think and i think that's too heavy for us and i think we don't want to start dealing with this because it can also get out of control and we can get losing what is our purpose in what we do yeah yeah you know but i think it's it's kind of interesting like it's almost like we're trying to deal with the problem with let's say institutions by having another kind of institution that is something that we can say hijack or something that is like hypothetical yeah but then i like this this this image of uh somebody was mentioning this in respect to the symmetry group and buff because the person who proposes the symmetry grouping path was the person who was beat uh vanessa if you're watching hello there's somebody who was really that she really wanted to and i wanted also i guess most of the people who come to the group want to have a serious um let's say in simple that that uh that path in a way doesn't feel so wide uh yeah in in in different ways um so that's in a way kind of uh one of the like uh things that we we wish the impact could things would move which in a way they're moving but not so fast you know they're moving since i'm there i can say that things are moving but you cannot force things you know things are half their own timing and that's part of an asymmetrical process also so uh wait what i was saying this because yeah so then somebody else was saying because she was expressing a bit of her her concern about the why is that we don't have so many people and why is this not working or something like this while in path we want to do this change or something like this um and then somebody said like it was using these words of like then maybe the symmetry group the main question was like are we doing something for path as the building there are or are we just using the network to send an email every two weeks to say the symmetry group is something that blah blah blah blah blah blah we're going to meet and so basically just using the institutional which path is not an institution but it's still a structure so we're using the network uh through for doing something so it was kind of a question like are we doing something for path in a way is this something valid for path maybe do we maybe need to withdraw from path uh i'm not using the network anymore and these kind of things and then somebody who's saying that maybe actually what the symmetry group is doing is like circum circulating path or doing more as a satellite uh more a satellite entity that is more passing around or maybe sometimes in between so it's not something that it is in the institution is not a part completely but it's sometimes in in oscillations uh with uh with path and this is how i think i see uh this that you're mentioning that in a way uh because it's the the practice is that in a way like no we said that although the practice is expressing expressions and so on we don't try to deal with politics and other things nevertheless those past from time to time and sometimes close sometimes far so they the politics pass but they don't stay so yeah i think i like these images of like being uh in this parabolic uh relations with the institution yeah i mean i think it's it's um a good way to illustrate i mean whatever politics or anything we don't like or we tried not to see but that's that is there we cannot say that the practice is something that we block ourselves from that but it's just it's there and we're here and somehow sometimes we cross our path but sometimes not um and i think that's that's the kind of the way of how we say you know like fluid um way of practicing working i don't know um yeah but i think this is this is very interesting like if you're thinking that i i should have opened this document a long time ago but maybe we go back to this conversation uh i go back to this conversation on on the streaming afterwards um that it's interesting that we are speaking here uh about the institution in a way um yeah about institutions about functionality responsibility basically you know like yeah yeah like it's just to me that i don't know i i'm trying to say this this it seems to me that how there may be a question how can one be responsible for something within its own freedom i see you know it doesn't make sense like in the sense like the example with the symmetry that was telling them i wish some people were saying maybe and they are creators there are people with the law academy backgrounds maybe we can in a way create certain program which is part of what they're doing by the right people and i was saying yes yeah i would be interesting but i won't do it you know i ca i cannot because this idea thinking that i need my freedom i think that's that's kind of to me it really relates to something you said uh i think it was last time can we have like a gathering where people don't care yeah and i still think that people need to care and i think what is important is like it has to be something that everyone has to care in a way but also they have the right to not to care if that can balance it's good well i don't know it's good but that's that may be interesting because often the case that someone has to organize something and they have their responsibility i mean not not in that way or maybe organizer is the you know or is the planner or organizer whatever the event is it's the mess and has to propose solution for the gathering so it has to be something concrete where to meet uh what time to meet who's going to be there um but if that becomes a bit more distributed that maybe there is one person leaning but like the people participating are not like just with the with the will of you know be there and just see what's gonna happen but if they have a little bit of responsibility to to somehow contribute to the gathering maybe then it started yeah but i think because we are we are overlapping things of this is this is a constant word that in in imposter being used since three years ago with this fourth rule and the symmetry is this idea of accountability because then we talk responsibility and accountability are two different things like being responsible for something it has to be more with you have to be yeah how to say like if i'm responsible it's like it's almost it comes on me you know it it's like it i have a a task and i'm being given a task so i'm responsible to do that or not doing that so i'm carrying that from the moment that you assign me the task until i finish i'm i'm assigned to do that so i'm responsible and also i'm accountable for so if the two things come together but accountability i think has to be more when you are accountable for something also allows you to be free because you can be accountable for taking responsibility i don't know say i'm gonna cook tonight um so i'm accountable uh for doing that but in between i'm i i think i'm free at the same time uh you know like i think responsibility is really is like a burden in a way and an accountability yeah is something that more i think it put it agents more freedom for both sides because actually yes because the responsibility is more on my side you know but accountability is actually is going more close to the law because you want to feel free you want to be at ease there is somebody accountable in case something goes wrong so by law to somebody that is accountable for something not working so it actually give us space to you and me and and what would you propose sorry um what i propose to be a designer i'm not a designer no to to but what i propose no i think that i think that i think account accountability is yeah i propose no way more accountability because accountability agents not only my freedom but your freedom yeah i think responsibility will if i'm responsible for something it agents your freedom not my freedom you see what i mean because then you can rest you're responsible for cooking i'm not you know and but i have the burden of that but if i'm accountable then it's a share is it it ages my freedom also and although it comes close to accountability is actually really to exercise law somebody is accountable of being guilty of charging for something close in language come close to law when you're accountable for something and i think is so i think in the uh yeah i think in this in the how we live in the system without going too crazy to trying to propose an utopia or something like this then we need the law is there for for uh it was created for humans to give a sense of relief you know you know that the law is supposed to punish when things are not right it's close to justice uh and then you don't have to think of these things because there is a constitution and these kind of things yeah so we need a constitution for best practices we need to write a constitution for best practices yes that's that's a bit like you know code of conduct in a way like communities i think yeah but this is part of what we were like when we when the text that you start proposing like best practices this is somehow kind of manifesto right there's a manifest on best practices uh yeah i see it more in that this is the construction this is the constitution because it is so real as it is so speculative it is it is right at the border uh of boat i i don't know why i hate the word manifesto just i don't know maybe it's just personal thing so i wouldn't manifest anything for best practices but constitution code of conduct maybe that's something we can make something we can write that can be constantly changed during the i don't know parliament or diet whatever we have to have a vote and we can change amendment of the best practices uh constitution we have to go to reform we reform the constitution every two years we we convoke to an assembly and we make sure that at least there is quorum so minimum like which means half plus one that's hard when if it's two of us then we have to agree yeah but then maybe that's that's actually something we can change you know we can have like two different uh best practices constitution and we have like two separate uh i don't know west best practices in east best practices oh but i think this is a very i think it's a very very nice exercise that this is more like the speculative and more thinking to what actually we are doing is that talking about the institution and talking about responsibility talking about accountability i will say better like then i would like to work more than word talk about accountability and question res uh resilience because this is what the system is showing us now and this is partly like i agree with that what we do is that we are exercising resilience but at the same time is uh is a flag for the government to say i don't care you guys just find out how to you need to be proactive and take care of your ass uh so this is something that is this resilience is uh it's like a a tool that is double-sided i see in one hand i think is what is good for for being independent uh within uncertainty and then exercise that through communities and people is just what is close to humans we don't have to speculate that that's we that's what becomes natural to us we should be together um so it's not a question but does not say that the government and the institution again is just using that as a strategy a strategy for those who have the power to say you know by the way scoby times you guys do your thing i mean it's okay for those who can manage but yeah they can already and then you know what then what is actually the government for um yeah but but you're right like you were talking like you're right in this spot like that works as long as you have the space for that as long as we are like for instance we are privileged we have the space to do this as long as you cannot then then then who is going to care for you boy then it's just not working that is out there is completely authoritarian and then you and me with their privileges they just end we just uh confirm uh post-colonial structures and all these things okay that's that's yeah i don't know we didn't explicitly talk about it but that's something we should come back once in a while because we are kind of privileged in the best practices um nation i don't know best prices i like this idea best practice nation we are probably like you know bourgeois and exploit the who those the ones who exploit from the the the people who don't have access to light love or something i don't know um yeah so actually even without going so far i think would be that makes sense i mean more in a futuristic or speculative narrative that is interesting to think that if we think of ourselves in terms of identity not only identities but just as a complexity of what we are then one can say then that actually the best practice nation saying what is when it's happening is just uh is arbitrary or is just not taking care of certain part of me that is suppressed of you you know this kind of things so without the need to go outside of us by just beating us and the other person they are in us you know the the naoto who speaks japanese for instance of uh all of the other ones that we have uh all of the other personas that we are are the but more like they are then they are some i don't know that somehow they are in that nation and uh yeah same thing in a way it's a is in an anarchy that we propose we don't we don't hear the voices over there i mean imagine really to do the exercise to in the chat you know like try to do in the chat like be or have the consciousness this seems like a really like an lsd trip then in a way you have to really do the exercise to extrapolate yourself and just be conscious and try to remember dimensions and things like that right and then bring them back to the parliament which is the chat in the parliament all of them come together and they speak about their experience i think that's that's really like what people do with uh larp live action role playing game that's what is that so it's like a role-playing game okay like i can open wikipedia um [Music] a larp is a form of role-playing game where the participants physically portray their characters the players pursue goals within a fictional setting represented by real world environments while interacting with each other in character the outcome of player actions may be immediate by game rules or determined by consensus among players event event event orange arrangers called game masters decide the setting and rules to be used and facilitate play um yeah and i think that's something that is not just as a game but that but people use um as a methodology to you know speculate or to simulate different settings i see and i never thought that's going to be like something i would be interested but from this conversation is basically what we're proposing is something like that yeah indeed this is very this is where girl is getting twisted it's getting very but we end up in this conversation the last time also we're getting very we're getting more twisted like in a good sense i guess like we're getting twisted like we're getting we we are squeezing so much things or the topics that we end up opening portals but yet we are not daring to enter them you see what i mean yeah so that's why that's why we need a guest to push us to that door the gate we are waiting for you on thursday 7 central european summer time s in set is for summer for you people if you didn't know this summer jorge in the past you didn't know now you know like you didn't know back then you didn't know okay like to be honest personally i found it's really confusing because set is the without summer right incest evidence but in the u.s they have this eastern is edt and esd but est s is the standard and edt d is the daylight saving and that's that's the opposite i think same for pacific pesd and pdt this is so confusing i should have said it it's so confusing too confusing jorgev just remember now you know get confused that's why that's why i missed japan that they don't have the daylight saving anyways yeah so i don't know i think we can close here yeah we can close you know unless we have like last words well the next next session will be on internet explorer wow imagine trying to do a best practice through internet explorer we cannot do blah blah blah that was the idea like the reason why i installed it because i i had the license somewhere and uh i have a virtual machine also the internet which internet explorer do you have there i don't know uh but it's from windows server 2003 and i think i think it's actually not really safe to keep it online i have a mac i have a macbook from 2008 i think oh yeah i have it at my parents place like the white one you know yeah like a plastic thing right yeah that's so beautiful this is so well designed oh yeah this is the this is the in famous uh internet explorer version six i love i love the sound [Music] yeah but yeah i i installed it for the practice like i thought maybe i can use it for something but it could be interesting to i would i would open this computer one of these days like i'm sure like but will be interesting if at least can share sound or receive sound too uh yeah that would be interesting okay but maybe before we go uh then to say it again that yeah that so i just closed now for the the recording no no wait anyone say that before yes before uh i want to take my grandma to be always oh sorry oh uh this is just an inside joke um so funny uh know that i think we are start touching very uh more political subjects i think in a way um and i think we start opening some gates to new dimensions so that will be very interesting if other people want to push us and or go with us to other dimensions because i feel that we are opening gates but we are not yet comfortable enough to jump and get lost i really like how you're like really talking to the camera i'm trying to convey my message we're really becoming a youtuber anyways uh so yeah then uh i guess see you on thursday yes uh yeah yeah and don't forget to like the video and subscribe subscribe to my channel please what can you win if you become the third subscriber no no no actually no like if you if you become the 10 then then there will be something special one if you are the 10 subscriber of my channel then you are mine then there will be something very special from the other side okay then uh see you bye bye", "ENmQK0ZCbQw": "hello everyone hello welcome what was happening today what's happening today um let's put some water we've been talking and yeah yeah we have been i don't know if there's anything that you want to i want i want to go like a bit of the so maybe some of the comments that you have where does the hydra editor come from who is the friend or relative oh yeah so that was like the i gave a presentation in uh one of the seminars that's what i've been doing these days and i got so basically what i did is i showed the the show rail the four minute video which i found it's actually really good that we made it oh i made it because where is it where is that showroom one that i i submitted for the one of the applications can you can you put that link also is that link in the links yeah should we actually watch it now because it might be interesting but yeah you just maybe want to do that yeah and uh share the screen yeah so how does it work um turn on the sound share screen with sound and optimize for video so hit start should we talk while we watch or we if it's necessary yeah i mean because there is no sound in that no some of them yeah and this is that you hear that this is this year this is this year yeah you hear it right no really yeah it's really yeah can you maybe just uh put up yours like down down the sound of your yeah uh so [Music] i [Music] this is your screen right it's your view that's my screen this is one of the first ones yeah this is back in july this is empathy the background is the church of the papa that was my birthday birthday stream this is when you were using um title cycles yeah the problem was understand if their future is not since it is not yet present and don't go for i'm working so it's bdmx oh yeah the famous one the painting this is kind of the thing sometimes like so nauto goes crazy i wasn't expecting that unless you start painting and this is this is the church yeah and that was on the facebook messenger oh yeah that was we didn't have internet so yes yeah this video i added because it's like the first part of it and then this is like towards the end i think well i think it's very cool in the practices like like at some point we were very into like uh that was work this isn't the note yeah this is the stage this one like i don't remember but i liked it when i was editing the video because like it looks like no but i my hands are like going over okay and that was four minutes it's i think it's very nice it's um that it's four minutes so it's certainly no i mean a real a short reel is maximum i don't know two minutes is like standards is one minute right um but it feels cool that this is four minutes and still i think i could just keep on going you know keep on watching yeah uh that's my feeling uh yeah it's very interesting um yeah can you share do you have this somewhere like is this is hosted somewhere do you have this did you uploaded this i i posted the link in the in the doc right now um where in the links yeah no at the comments at the seminar where your cursor is now and yeah i didn't i didn't post it like public because i thought it's only for the application but maybe it's good yeah i think it's i will just put it in the links i will put it just under here sure uh and then i will say here this is oh so basically this is the one that i i've shown in the in the seminar and then i thought about q and o so instead of me answering the questions we watch this together and then i asked for questions but i didn't answer immediately i collected some questions and then i went through try to answer or answer or try to tell a story based on those questions so this is this is part of them when now to get us as comments where does the hydro editor come from who is the friend or relative yeah i don't understand what it but it means like who is the friend or relative that's funny because it's part of the last three hours we have been speaking about my grandma for some reason together with mark zuckerberg yeah so yeah exactly you know because um i liked it but uh well he was the guy asked the question was well first like curious about what this hydra thing is um i think he just saw it on the the url of one of the windows i used and then also like ask like you know who who this guy is is it like your friend or your relative i don't know if that he meant too relative but i think you know because of english he's not so fluent so he somehow said that word but i thought i thought it's so funny that you know um yeah i mean why not maybe you're my relative you know yeah i'm relative uh i i will subscribe to that you have to be relative and relative uh okay the second comment it says like best practice is your real creation how is created what best practices means to me the best practices give to you yeah give the the the the video gives impression of a room where you enter physically there to look around as a visitor yeah so this is like one comment like first of all like i didn't really explain what the best practices means and i think the title of the video is called best practice practices show real so like i think she was wondering like what does it mean by best practices and how it how the videos are you know curated okay well what i found is very interesting is that i mean the two is that the best practice as a title is something that is potent is it potential things by itself um and at the beginning even even at the beginning when we thought it was kind of a sarcastic thing uh as we mentioned in previous uh episodes is that um it's something that actually is so uh yeah it just it it potential things right best practices uh yeah the the long name is the best practices in contemporary dance and i think it fits in our context because it refers to the post dance so i think it is concrete in the sense like we're proposing best practices in contemporary dance or in post dance in that sense um yeah yeah that's what i wanted to say i think that well we propose i mean you don't propose we just search for that i think that's that's my standpoint but anyways okay so next one how long are the projects i think i think it's it's good that she also like just from the video she thought like like it's like a like a room like a space rather than like watching video which was quite nice yeah and we talked about it before in some of the chats i think about this kind of space rather than um yeah i forgot what the context is but at one point i was trying to construct like with hydra like make kind of the room and also like that connects to the stage design [Music] yeah how long are the practices feel like going back and forth and yeah because of how the video was edited i think uh he was thinking that it looks like you know like he moved from like different time stamp to another one which is how the video is edited and yeah he was wondering like how long uh this one session is just good question i think i like it because this is like non-linear time uh yeah and that's one of the the the things that going back into like concept what we talk about in a way like i think something is more valid now as art when you i mean when the time frame is not defined i mean when you can get lost in the time so in that sense like uh i think it's um achieved somehow like the the linearity is uh is not say what i'm trying to say is like yes what i'm trying to say is like in their process although you can like in in the in the practice are in the archive as a practice then actually it doesn't really matter that much if you start watching from the last ones or the first ones although you can actually if you really want to do the exercise to follow one by one since july 2020 until now you might find things that you think it progressed somehow they go advanced somehow they are not necessary it doesn't matter you can start watching different uh order and it will be still you will get a sense a real sense of what is the practice yeah yeah the next one is um the code and output like how we performatively interact with the code while we dance and normally like people see the end result of what code does but we do it on the fly so that in a way in a way that was kind of like a positive comment about like yeah like the you guys perform within the code uh embodiment code embody it buddy man how do you call that at some point embodiment code embody it i forgot like in blackbeam and code embodiment code embodiment i don't know that's but you know what i mean like this uh like to embody it the code it means that then in taking the the words of the what the person says before is that how performatively we interact with the code that's kind of the code embodiment like embody it the code actually i wrote embodied code yeah that's what i was thinking embody it yeah different grounds working space come together i don't understand um i don't remember what what what it was it seems to me like a loops you know it seems to me like different rounds like loops working space come together maybe it's the separate spaces but it kind of looks like we're working together this is this is the kind of things that this is the kind of like q and o this is a this is an example of q and o for me because it says different rounds working space come together so the proposition in itself is an option actually so it let me think for instance that uh i will think the different rounds as loops and only through loops and during an extended period of time is that other things start appearing uh and going back to this idea of like active uh audience you know like only when the performance extends itself during certain amount of time where you don't demand the attention of the public during the whole time uh is when things start appearing slowly as a mantra calling basically the extra side of the mantra uh they will the that you will just repeat and then just during the the repetition of the mantra is that things start to form um that's the way who i interpret uh this uh and so that's what i'm saying that this i see this as a good example of that q and o that's an oh there's a really an option because it gives me agency to hey you know what actually this i see it like in this way moving through yeah moving through spaces not screens fluid states of work in between work and performing or is even in between this is just what do you think about this um what was it so it's like we like work means like i think it's coding and then we kind of also move and the question first was is it like what like how to like with the yeah the fluid state between coding and then moving but is it is it actually even in between is it the right word yeah but i think this is very very interesting because i i see these when you refer to work as labor basically that could be code that could be any other working aspect you know like just labor um then yeah in a way it seems that the person kind of catched what in a way what we said we do that is like in terms of not privileging things that it's not privileging elements but just like being in the space in between you know uh not privileging or the code or the dancing or the sound like not privileging but just being always in the space in between grouping and ungrouping the construction and composition freeing the way of work hmm this is kind of similar in a way to me yeah it was like i think it was interesting that there was this question i mean there was this key word deconstruction and that's something i mean we maybe we talked i don't know i don't think we specifically used that word before but it was you know it was a thing in art some time ago i think but yeah i mean deconstructing no but that's i think that's the interesting part because like we talked of one of the the other chats we mentioned we were talking about this this idea of the deconstruction enter like uh linguistics uh through their reader in philosophy who is the first one who start proposing basically this idea that only when you have um only when you are really mature uh only a mature person would start actually not knowing based on the idea that the world is so complex that is just a massive object a massive group of objects they are at the same time subdivided or deconstructed in small pieces and you can go on and on um so this idea of the construction is super super i mean this is an award that you will use you will hear very often in art like with i mean like for instance and elena she likes to work to use that word very often when i when i talk to her and i guess i use it also in my language um i guess we don't use it that often because in a way in a way we refer this we to we refer to grouping and ungrouping things um because the idea of deconstructing is like is i think it goes straight on the dimension of like uh object and sublayers you know so it goes in a way it has a hierarchical and not only no it's not hierarchical but it has a um directional proposition when i say deconstructing because i means that i need to start from body from jorge extremities uh arm hands hand uh arm fingers uh nail and so on it it has a directional uh proposition in in the in descent in the word itself it sub divides uh in more folders and folders and folders yeah that's why like at first i said you know what already constructing like is it even like constructed i think that's also like uh in the other application we wrote um i don't know if i can find it right now but yeah like we are like you know reclaiming the the body was it but is it even something that we already had before yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i think that was interesting now like that we yeah because this is so so i said like when we were writing i said basically that we are reclaiming the body through that process and then you add to that sentence like did we have that body even before you know did we have that [Music] um yeah there's a question i'm not negotiating yeah and it's not a dialectic process so we can just end with a question am i i was right i was fighting i was right when i said like we make free the body through renouncing to functions and value uh um but yeah this i think that's why somehow it works because and that's what it makes it more complicated or more it demands more responsibility what we do right now um because we are trying to in a way then articulate uh the language to transmit the idea of what we do what i'm saying is inner practice is granted and in inner language i mean that's why maybe we don't have to speak about the construction because it's granted from long time ago that we don't know if we are even composing uh so it's just something that in a way it seems that is not interested i i it's not really interesting i guess for us to talk maybe that's why we don't bring it because we give that for granted in the way that it's just something that is blob that is just blobbing and it's just grouping and ungrouping and talking about the elements and all these things the idea of deconstruction because it's directional it's just not fitting in that in that spectrum because it's just compromising the the practice to say that we deconstruct something you just frame it it's just frame so much of the blob into a box to deconstruct that uh not formed uh [Music] thing yeah so i think it's good that we find connection to different ideas but we know that we are different oh we are different i'm not that i wanted to say that but it's not like a classical idea of deconstruction no but yeah maybe something that i want to i want to add in that is that yeah in regards to responsibility like in order to make visible and give this more as an option like a real option for other people to we put it in the last application that we said this is a valid option that can work as a tool map toolbox for other people to just see what is already there for one year insisting in the idea so going back to their responsibility is because we might personally i don't want to lose the fun because this is just fun we have been talking since 11 today now it's five so we have been just talking with naoto and although just this is what it comes online it's just still so fun so it just now that we just start trying to write more and be more concrete in order to share a more specific framework or an idea through some semantics and words it becomes a responsibility in one hand that to in order to try to make it more accessible for others which means that now to me we have to articulate better our language and uh to talk about this that is granted within the construction of the practice during the the more than one year of practicing um but that i don't want to lose the fun yeah that's just that that would be that's the delicate part how to keep on building something that is more concrete in order to be shared without losing the fun no no i added fun with comic sans with comics okay next one how i present with videos [Music] i mean i think there was someone who said you know it's it becomes like another performance and i think that's like also the thing that we wanted to think about how we interact with the past videos past finances and that becomes another practice so that's that's one thing i think yeah we can maybe think about like not just like a chat but think about how we present it to other people that would be nice but that would be so nice because i need to do as well my presentation for the school and i have 12 minutes uh and this is my master thesis you know it's not about so it's something that it has to perform within the framework of the whole school which is a technical school uh so that will be interesting uh i think this video that you make it works so much yeah and and then just now start i i start thinking because i need to start thinking on my presentation you know what is actually and just listening to what was the feedback of the promoter the guy who uh followed from the school he was saying you need to really give time for the people to just be there to say nothing there's so much material that is nice visually but also just nice that maybe you don't want to add anything else because it's just by itself is good because there is no purpose in a way yes because there is no really purpose in trying to say like you know what understand me then my idea is this you know i'm forced that uh like in 20 seconds to make convey this message so perhaps i'm just thinking out loud perhaps although for instance thinking in a real will be something that should be more like i don't know one minute maybe it will be completely out of this uh out of the guidelines that i will use let's say the real that you propose say like i'm just saying like if i will be using the real uh as the first thing that i will do in my presentation which is four minutes that's completely against what they wait what they teach me for four years uh and but that's interesting um because and what i think is interesting is because i'm not studying in an art school meaning that the that space where i'm proposing my final work is not a space to conceptualize something so i'm not yeah it's that's not the space nevertheless i think because the format and because what we have achieved so far from my point of view it speaks for itself it might be necessary to then show the show reel for four minutes and that's uh kind of a question a valid question that i started having uh like to present this in that context and to see what would be the reaction actually uh which because normally what i think they will receive is like or here well you should know this be like short wheel is 20 seconds why you put four minutes you know uh this kind of things yeah i i totally understand i mean it's yeah it's up to you i guess it's really also it's not something that you know we're doing certain type of thing that people can immediately get deconstruction was a thing or somebody wrote that i think someone commented so i just took a note so that's that's the thing you know we talk about the deconstruction but actually that's like the thing 30 years ago and uh that's when around the time when i was born and the last time the last thing and yeah things should be from 30 years ago is that's derrida the one who started speaking about this um and the last thing that is net art versus net based art and this is something very interesting and i'm writing i mean i have to i put one of the subjects to write in my paper about some context basically of you know from where it comes that we end up doing this um and so what can you say something about net art versus net based art i have to say i kind of misunderstood the question and i forgot what was the original intention of the question but she said something about like there's net art and that based art and i thought that's kind of interesting term so i know that but i forgot her point but for me um i have how i how i interpreted was like after the pandemic i think that was uh audi uh the alina she's like a famous net artist works with like archive of geocd's it's really fun uh she said she tweeted on uh on twitter she said something about like the categories of the the motivation why people start doing met art and the new category is that they don't have choice so they have to do net art because of the pandemic and they cannot show anything on the physical space so artists have to start doing net art even though they don't like it that was kind of the context and i think that's really interesting because for us it's it's a bit like that uh it was definitely like um the reason why we started but also like we're not like trying to um fit into a certain format we're not like trying to make a documentary film or you know 360 video dancing or whatever or vr piece but we just do whatever that's that works for us and i think that's really interesting and also like i like we talked about in accessibility or like the the other application that yeah this is like option that we want to show to other people who thinks that there is no other option yeah i mean but this is completely valid because if as i mentioned before what i'm trying to say in my paper is that i'm proposing basically a new medium an art form so uh because there is no other option uh and i think it's very this is very in line to that the yeah this is very very much in line to it's just must happen basically so i put it from the context of dance you know like dance was not ready to do these things and it was forced um but it's just not good so then we have to do something about it uh and so is this what it is the proposal um but it's from not having an older option you know there is no other option we should do it i think that's very interesting um yeah but wait because that maybe i would like to to spend a little bit more of time this and if you can if you have more information about this than me than to share with me so this like the internet art it starts like from like from the the cyberpunks in the 80s or from where it comes from this i don't know i mean we should go to because i mean right zone because i know i mean from the way who i was following up this is from actually you know like fluxus and nanju-pek and more electricity-based and signal-based uh which at the end becomes what is known now as video art you know uh but that's the way how i trace it you know until video art um [Music] i see i just posted a link to rhizome art base they collect digital artworks they say it's from 1999 and 99 but it seems it's the first one is 1995 that they show but what is it what is the cattle what what is the they're saying this is called what kind of art or what like digital art or what i think they're focused on net art resume yeah but if you go to the menu there's like a browse and then they can they have this like sorting in [Music] years uh where at road at the top and where in the door like they say about browse query about yes so then should i browse or browse ah no no i see yeah browse okay so the first thing i see is 83 performances with electronic electro acoustic clothes okay and then knight one the thing this is interesting i haven't look at this this is very interesting because i mean the way i was tracing this is through ninja bake um so i guess at some point he will appear here but now japan is older oh it's there i think it's a bit different kind of idea here because the way the thing is like with danger back as i said it's kind of like it goes until what is called video art you know when when the film becomes when it's a video art uh but he was working so yeah he's not code based his work is more like hardware based like when i mean he's that's not even the intention but he end up working with electricity and signals basically but it's not the focus of what they're doing and it's not really like network so much no no no yeah you're completely right yeah the idea although like i think he was the first because that's back then i think the first one he's the first one who's proposing the network as a as a concept when he proposed this broadcast uh performance that i that i that i shared with you the last time that he's the one who he was doing for i think two months or something like that a broadcast tv show that it was connecting paris new york and uh south korea and and that was the he was the first one who was doing this network thing through television uh waves um yeah i don't know like i think it's in a way it's it's a network but at the same time like broadcast is not network so maybe that's why it's a little bit separate yeah because not because this is really related to i guess like to computing like you know like already computing um yeah but computing and network is also should be separate because you they had computers back then yeah but they were not usually computers they were not using the computers for that like the way ho the the way he was using the network yeah and i'm not just saying namjoon pike but uh it was uh sorry i'm really distracted um no it's okay um no no not not just like limited to him but there are like works around uh you know computers but that doesn't connect to net art unless they use specifically use a network yeah but i think it's very interesting like i mean you're talking here like implicit on things that you i mean just during this this path that i was following and i did a presentation last year about this thing that ended up in an abstraction and it's the way who i was following into uh in more interactive art and i guess dance and technology that's the way i was following the path through performances through fluxus and this kind of things um more like yeah and then william foresight and this kind of things but what i'm trying to say that is very that is intrinsical there is that the idea of abstraction it comes very much through that path uh following together also with painters that i don't know exactly how but because i was the last year i was exposing that i don't remember exactly but this like the idea of abstracting something to the minimal the uh form that i think one of the maximum maximums exponent exponents of this is roku the painter when he starts painting blocks in colors i don't know if you remember this painter uh rocco i think is her name um he i think he's called one of the masters of abstractionism pro cool paintings paintings [Music] mark they mentioned him as one of the like the the extreme like the yeah there is one painting of him that's very very famous it's just a square painting in black because he was painting with colors and the extreme of that is just the square painting in black um because just that supposed to ris uh resume anything to the minimal uh abstraction of the form or i don't know i'm not an art history and i'm not gonna start inventing things but anyway the idea is there about the abstraction um and somehow then when you mix that like let's say net art and when you have like so many components and then use the um there is a lot of abstractions there but uh in a different way that i cannot even what i'm trying to say is that how is that the idea of abstraction understand i mean understanding abstractions to the the minimal components of something uh become something that is overpopulated say the screen with glitches let's say like a net art of what we do like i would i would mention this as abstract things um you see what i'm trying to say like i'm trying to to to see how to connect if the abstraction of something is to paint everything in black because it's the minimal representation of an idea in one hand how to connect that to the other extreme what is just full of glitches and things they are just uh completely overwhelming uh or just saturating the canvas which is completely the different spectrums and still you can mention as valid both as an abstractions that's what i'm trying to reconciliate because i don't understand that how does it work if somebody knows please send send us an email yeah but that kind of makes sense in in terms of like you know information entropy and stuff like in a way with glitches it becomes like saturated and kind of becomes like noise basically at the end it's like there's no representation even if it's full of even if it's what even if he's like full of information you cannot really see it because it's just like if it becomes totally random then it's there's no information basically so maybe that's something that is related i don't know yeah yeah that makes somehow that is true because it's it's true i mean i subscribe to this idea but you said that if they net art then what you have to say is just a cat that is multiplied 200 times and then every time they just you're leaving the trace of the cat let's say an example so then the canvas is becoming more as oversaturated by the the representation a of a cat you know it's not the abstraction of a cat it's just a cat it's an icon of something um but then because it's just oversaturated with cats it just becomes something else where the cat is lost right the cat is not cut anymore it's just a blurry thing that they just give it's just similar then to our process it just give agency to other things to be the cat becomes something else it's not the cat anymore right yeah i mean this idea of glitch is something that i always think about because there is this pure sense of glitch that happens as un intended non-intended phenomena yeah yeah but also there's i think it's it's being overused uh in the popular culture like tv series movies or even like commercials to you know just like glitch kind of effect as an effect to make it pretty um especially you know this uh rgb shift thing yeah yeah and pixel sorting i just hate them because it's just like yeah whatever i see you can you can just put it in after effects and then you have it yeah so and but i also like me it's something really interesting because then if that's the reference that i don't like in the popular culture then what am i doing in hydra for example i make similar effects i mean i don't so i don't say it's effect but it's yeah what what what is it yeah i see what i mean yeah but i mean but then you're mixing things between like this is this is a personal appreciation that you're sharing here with us um and then it's totally valid but then what i will say is that how the way how i feel about it is that because i can relate and i can say the same things with dance and with the state of the art of dance you know like oh yeah but post modern dance is just like privileging a lot the individual the representation on this so you're just free and then you're just becoming like a hippie who just go to the space and just become just become therapeutic of i don't know um yet then i will do that also right uh i will do that so why am i doing that in that space so so this is a personal appreciation of that so i think a part of my problem with the space in that case dance is just then what am i doing with that space so no not not trying to solve my problem in relation to why the rest of the world is trying to see the space in that way so why the rest of the world is trying to see dance as a therapeutic space so i'm not trying to solve that problem but there is more like what am i doing with that space because i'm if i'm trying to solve the problem of the world i go nowhere i mean this is it's just a stupid career race against the world but then instead of how can i actually do something with with what i think with the space so in our case then with the practice um i think we don't stay too much in the problem of the yeah kind of this politics of the space basically but then just we do and actually find um [Music] uh the other person in this case like you are actually saying to me yes jorge is good you can do this in this in the canvas you know and i'm agents you also i'm i'm encouraging you to do this in the comments um and i think that's very important uh this dialectic and the dialect this this dialectic uh process in in that respect [Music] yeah and i think it's also like important to think that it's not like we're trying to you know we're not using after effects we're not using you know um cinema 4d or anything to make it like really cool which makes it easier for people to judge if it's good or not or if they like it or not but but we do in a sense like it you know like a bigger um more like this bigger picture of the idea of glitch is something that we try to introduce something that is not cannot we cannot judge kind of goes back to martin but what you see in the video is there's something that is well i'm not saying something new but it's hard to like you know find reference that you can say that it's you know it's a good video or not but it's it's just what it is and maybe that's i would say i will say that what you see in the video is something real from that from that perspective like yeah like what would you see in the video i mean in the case but in the practice then what somebody will see is very real because it yeah it's very real because it doesn't deal with representation identities and all so on like all the problems that you might have with glitches all the problems that i might have with dance and dancing uh so we tried not to represent this idea of this problem this politics yet they passed through all of them because i cannot stop being jorge for the time that i'm doing the practice so it is so real so then the glitch is real in that sense because it is me with all my problems with all my questions with all my background but i'm not hijacking that space with my problems yet they pass they don't stay but they pass so that's what i'm saying that then that then the glitch that you see is real is real me and you in space i see i think it's important that it's not like we're trying to produce let's say a video or we're not claiming that it's a dance piece because then and also people will see it as a dance piece or video what is it i don't know i think i think he said i think it's a dance piece that's a huge statement but but this is very this is very strange now because this is kind of a sarcastic thing but and i i mean in a way i'm expecting then you will say like i think this is a glitch because this is just speaking me from my from this from the problem where we start talking about this then you mentioned like i don't know i have problems with glitch and then you mentioned why this is coming from your problems and then i say like i don't know what is dance this is dance so therefore in a way i'm kind of saying like you know what this is dance um yeah because i don't know do you know why because i don't know better than that actually so then i'm being honest life is because i don't know what is it so the since i don't know what is it and but the closest in a way that i have information for is to say dance then i will say then is dance i will stay if i have to then use a blade and and speak from the truth i will say this is dance let the dance be you see yeah why not but no but the interesting here is like do you subscribe to the idea that this is a glitch for you um like the practice is it's a glitch for you but it's crazy i mean it's a bit like it's not really spot on in a way because glitch is not a germ of art for example yeah yeah okay but is is that if the question is what we're doing is glitch or not then maybe that's a valid question and um say it again again if the ques if the question is is it what we do is glitch or not yeah then maybe i have to say yes wow that's such a statement [Laughter] this cannot be this cannot be positive this is a but this is very controversial this is this is very interesting because this is the compromise you know this is when you actually you have to deal with yourself in order to to make some house sense i don't know this is but this is very interesting this is this is very very interesting yeah but at the end like you know it's just what about what matters is what how people perceive it or maybe not i don't know i was thinking that but i think that's the cool thing that i was saying i was sharing this with uh diana and then i thought that this idea of caring no saying like that i care so much for like in the practice you know like i care so much for the practice and we have built such a caring place that i actually can give me give space to not care about you and we talk about that and we grow about the in the application actually we didn't we didn't mention it we tried we tried but that was the idea yeah we didn't articulate that but this is this is a very interesting place because it's just because the space is so safe already that actually just then we don't care that we that we can we can give us we we can give agency to not caring and just go full on in our fears desires wishes and so on um and it's just a contradiction in itself it's just because we care so much that we but that's that's true labor that then we we cannot then we have to mention them here ecologies in a way that i don't know if ecologies but just labor that because we have built this build build the space and then this is maybe a question i want to finish them with this then from my understanding it's just because we have built the space through labor and time hours and archive is that we can give space to not care so then the question would be would not would it not be possible to just propose a space that is by itself caring that people can just jump and not care for the other one but people in general like like yeah people like say yeah this is just more in general say that as this is a framework but say that there is a framework that me or you or other person propose and there is not yet the labor in it that to build confidence trust and so on um will be possible that the space by gathering should like say that say that's a gathering say like a gathering ring will because a community in a way like the community going back to this idea the community will could build the trust right and the elements to to to build trust within participants but the gathering in the sense of just appearing cannot because it doesn't have the resources so then again it's like can a gathering offer the safety to not care within between the participants i don't think so they have to care you have to care but i mean then it's impossible not to speak if then we go to that that place then i will say it's possible but then depending of who is there you know then you speak about context and then basically then you have to go through politics and identities you know if you invite a group of people and somehow then you know more or less who is this kind of people so in a way you have to start boxing the people to kind of like believe that they're not going to kill each other uh then the place can care for it the gathering can't care for itself but no no no forget what i'm saying because then it's like there will be a curatorial process of selecting who is going to the gathering and that's not the gathering right okay yeah yeah or maybe if the gathering is the gathering of the cursors then maybe it's okay because there is nothing then in that case it works yeah because yeah in in the gathering of the cursors it doesn't matter what you do with the cursor you know like it's okay yeah i don't need to care but if i want that's a good example but but then we go that's a good example i think that's that's brilliant because then we speak about functionality it's not functional the arrow is not functional in the gathering of arrows is therefore it's is it is not gonna uh damage a function yeah truly i think that we speak about i think it's a good point like it's only when we speak about functionality which often in our system relate to value time and this kind of things commodity is when we can say like it's effective not effective it works doesn't work when something has no function in that case a web therefore maybe for other people then the example was trying to propose a space which is partly coming from olivia's performance only a jack's performance where there was just uh says a camera the campus and then the cursors who are joining the website kind of start doing things i mean not doing things basically just move around and then sometimes they will uh yeah just cursors around to not go far with that so in that sense there is not too much functionality on the website that was not really functional and then we if we go back to the idea of the of the caring and not caring it will be possible it will be possible to to do well it will be possible to share not carrying space to the arrows can you can you can you can you say what i'm trying to say because i think you understood because i also don't care about what i'm saying because you don't care you don't care about what i'm saying but you're saying like it's not functional it's i was saying that we were trying we were saying we were we were saying about caring that how would the po together the question will be how will be possible to share a gathering space which is just like like how to share how to share a gathering space where is possible not uh don't care not to care right but and then i said if if there are cursors maybe it's okay then but cursors are not functional so that's okay in the in the example of the website in this website and they're just coming inside and right but maybe yeah maybe it's actually it's an interesting point i mean the important point because that's also like what you expect from the gathering right if you just expect to you know interact with other cursors maybe it's okay and everyone cares you know it doesn't have to care but it works because you expect to interact with other cursors and everyone's doing whatever with the cursors and then you will be satisfied yeah i mean maybe not but no but i mean but this is but then we go this is going one step further because then is then is defining already in advance what is the the the function of the gathering which i think is not the place that we are talking about yeah but then like what because the reason why i think like when i when you just speak about you know if you care or not in the gathering um [Music] it you know comes down to the the code of conduct and it happens i mean that is there because there are maybe harassment that should not be there and through the cursors yeah harassment harassing increaser okay let's imagine the abstraction of harassing another cursor but then you know like harassment because it's it's also like you know i think it's also because people have different expectations in the gathering or an event or whatever and it doesn't somehow this like discrepancy between people that causes well if it's intentional then it's it's fat but also sometimes it can be non unintentional um but how you talk to other people could be harassment depending on the context and yeah yeah that's that's what i associate with you know when you say about what was it caring but then it has to be in relation with i think the problem is when we start from but yeah what the moment when they start becoming complicated is when things have a reason to function you know like when people start defining life because a gathering anyway at some point becomes something that it just it naturally i think it should evolve from i guess uh nowhere but it becomes something so it at some point it has a function the gathering at some point it becomes the brave party of uh or a gathering of cursors of something and then once the function is defined then people will start coming with their things basically like expectations and questions and but wait we are stuck we are stuck with this this is a very i guess it seems that it's not so easy i guess to to speak from to going back from what we start like to not care uh in our experience i was there to say then it's just possible to build through labor in our case like to yeah basically to work then just rebuild the trust and then the labor is there um and although the ecology which is more in relation to the economy is not there so it's not directly there because we are not thinking on that from the beginning um yeah i think it's just yeah it's possible through labor like not caring is possible through labor and time basically isn't there care isn't that so you're separating the care and the labor somehow how because i thought like you when you say you know building trust is actually through caring um in a way the caring isn't intrinsical is because i think in our case because we don't have a let's say going back to the idea of function like the practice didn't have a function we didn't know what to do with the practice right so um we i guess at the beginning we didn't have too much the idea of to care i guess about the other that much more than mutual respect and stuff like that uh but then we wanted to we wanted to to share a working space that's actually a good question was it was there that kind of care or not i think there was because i know that if i just do whatever i want to do then it won't happen it won't work no no because then but then then i think it goes back to like basics human humor human relationships you know like if you propose a space and then i appear and then i just start cursing to you and say yeah go yourself or being super rude i don't think you will have a state or the other way around because it's just just huge basic human interactions that uh i guess we stay because for some reason we want to share space to glitch and to do things around the computer um but we didn't have a function for it i see um i still don't know if that care thing uh if i agree or not but but it is it is i mean it's interesting that there was no function in the practice i mean for sure like when we started last um like let's say last july when we really started this format we didn't think about you know we have to apply for this we have to go to node and do something we didn't think about you know these concrete ideas and also like i think i was not trying not to think this as um i mean we had this idea of you know like broadcasting you know like live streaming and show it but besides that i didn't think about like anything as an output to apply for something to show it somewhere uh even if it's like live stream it's not like you know we try to find a partner and find it you know a way to do it like super big um that is that is true yeah that but then it has to i mean we vote in a way it seems to me like then we are of course the point that we don't completely agree but that in a way it worked because there was no functional when we proposed it was not functional there was not a clear purpose in like we are trying to succeed with what we do because we didn't know what we were doing yet and then back against the trust yet yet i guess somehow we have we should have inspired in the other one some sort of trust that actually made possible to keep on coming and meeting well when when we didn't even met in person right yeah i mean that's actually that's a important point because we didn't meet until october that was it was but like for those who don't know like we didn't met with naoto and we were working for some months i guess until october if it's like from starting from april then like half a year almost and until we met until there was a possibility thanks to yen and note 20 thank you very much guys it was very important for us because then basically we were working and then all of a sudden we have to go and share a small space and then live together for a week and that was very it was i think it's this kind of moment where it might work or it might not work and that's just due to human relationships you know for some reason if i don't know say i don't like your smell i don't like what you cook i don't like your face or something if my juice or the other way around it might just not cannot work yeah that's it but i mean that besides that like we managed to you know work together for work or practice for like half a year without taking like only with meeting online which is you know it's not easy but the question is like you do you think that it because for instance if i think now now now i have no doubt that there's still there's a lot of room for keep on i don't know doing what we do um dancing engaging and but back then at some point i guess i thought you know like i guess i was not thinking back then it's just i don't know but it seems to me you just let me try to put this in my question do you think if we haven't met then we could we will be still working i mean we will have if we wouldn't have met in frankfurt in node we would have still we will be here still working that's a good question [Music] that's a good question i i don't know i it's hard to say um yes and no um it's a good question but maybe i think so because it's not that you know what happened that node was was great but it's not that something changed it's also like interesting that it like when we met it was not like you know um we didn't feel anything uh like discontinuity from how we met online no it was not it was not strange you know right that was that that was strange that it was not strange true yeah so maybe it was okay unless like we started to feel like okay we have to meet and we have to find like a residency and we have to like apply for like 100 grants and then we exhaust ourselves maybe then we stop meeting that i don't know yeah yeah yeah but that was joke but um yeah but i think that that's a that's the space that we are right now like that that's going back to what i said some time ago that is how to keep it that that's up to us you know how to make sure that we keep it fun you know for some reason like today like i was not feeling uh like doing the live streaming although for me it's very important to feel that we do it once per week in this format because this is coming soon for the unless for my dissertation thesis um but then for some reason then then i thought it would not be fun i mean this is more fun we we have been speaking from the 11 and so it's a long time now it's gonna be six or almost so it has been a long time uh and this is fun um yeah but maybe we should close soon because this is getting less fun maybe yeah and i will have end up with like full of cursors on my wall so yeah this is this was very interesting like i think we talked like a lot of uh very interesting i i thought it was very cool the maybe you should start putting your what are you doing the seminar uh in person or was through uh video online well very interesting if you have if you are in the room with them and then just you keep like a box with a q and o for best practices and then they just put the comments of your q and o because this was very interesting like the the comments on the seminar that was very very interesting to go through together that was very cool yeah so i hope somehow like that when we have some interaction in that sense with the with a with the hopefully with joanna um or with my type of my grandma we'll see the first one who is answering yeah first come first first come first first yeah we'll see it will be cool it was a nice exercise to do this so i guess we just closed the chat uh yes there's no more backstage uh we just finished and that's it i guess so um yeah thank you guys next time please like the video and subscribe to the channel whatever that means and see you soon ciao", "Kx8lVCxXLgA": "[Music] because i have been writing a house in a project so i have been thinking about the best practices in life in the morning and writing so all right to get in touch there um or something else not really no no i mean i sent you random stuff but uh yeah it's just random i mean yeah there's more chats like we do the chat we do a chat yeah it's more chat yeah but like when i was you know this uh because you wrote like reclaiming the body i thought it's really interesting this um novel that i really like it's i mean i don't know if you have time to read it it will be i mean it's quite interesting it's a book i recommend yeah it's a novel by um japanese writer haruki murakami and and is what i saw is a book about what um it's hard to say it's like oh there's a wikipedia link that i put so it tells you what it is it's like two bizarre narratives one is right cyberpunk i i don't know sci-fi oh i got a book i got a book also yeah okay so tell me about the uh like i just you know this world end thing the end of the world oh is that one is the one that you sent me the end of the year yeah yeah okay cool yeah it's funny because i sent you a picture also i just got a preston that i bought forever that's a tarot it was a card and then it came with the guidebook of the tarot and then there was one card it was saying at that moment exactly more or less the end world you see yeah but it's it's funny because the one i sent you is more um in a way it's less dramatic that the end of the world is actually like it's a place and it's uh it's also like eternal so there's nothing going to happen that it's just like reduced into routines what i found that i thought it was very very nice or very scary because they because people could not have shadows so the shadows were taken away from you right so they make me think this idea of opacity and visibility um yeah i mean this this thing stays in my head like well we were we were writing and then i thought like actually based on what we propose is only when we renounce to our value so our shapes and function that we can start claiming our freedom back humans um so it's like it's that's more like a statement that uh that i start to believe is true uh coming from the practice itself that only when you lose your humanity as you know it is when you can start reclaiming your body back your freedom the freedom that you lost you see your human experience uh based on lock idea or freedom and this idea of that the human is free uh but the society corrupts it you know based on that assumption that you're free when you're born but just slowly you start getting corrupted and then just and you are in the system so based like towards that idea of reclaiming that freedom that body you need basically to lose yourself in our case persons like the pixel space worked very well or i mean that's a that's um that's a speculation yeah but i like that idea i like that idea it sounds to me a bit radical but it seems to me also that is it makes sense like what you said or the i mean yeah i know what i'm saying it sounds to me like it stays in my head very radical uh and that is that is that's only when you lose your val the function like i mean sorry from the shape that is in a way like this shape through the pixel space but then moreover the function and then you start thinking in my masculinity then i start going in my identity what is my function as men and there and then after that just when i renounce to my male hood my and all my identities can i start just then to renounce to my value because then i have no value for society therefore i can i'm not commodity therefore i'm free i'm not i'm worthless for the neoliberal system and therefore then i could be in this atmosphere of the thing you know like i could be just a sub something that is not required for nobody the thing just like they're in the space nobody requires me nobody wants me so just then you are free see yeah i mean it's basically i think that's something we're kind of starting to figure out and yeah we can continue talking about it i i mean like idea-wise i think it's i totally agree and i think what i'm more interested in is like how we can perform well don't have to form a narrative around it but how do we deliver it to other like it can be writing an application or can be talking or can be something else but like how do we effectively effectively sounds like some connected efficiency but how do we engage with other people because we already kind of know it yeah yeah but it's hard to tell to pick other people anyways but also in the in the um like for instance i was thinking to to do an exercise this week so normally what i will do when i promote the practice or something i'll do it just until so it's 24 hours when it goes and when it goes automatically off from return uh i will just promote one time so for one day let's say but then this time i thought like maybe i will do it more time to see what happens so then i have a goal i will try to keep on promoting the same practice that i'm linking in my instagram which is actually going to your streaming because mine was [Music] then my goal with that is to see if i can have 50 views at the end of the week and then i'm checking from time to time we should set up a website webpage so that the link stays the same and we just edit the web page like live streaming iframe because we need it anyways at some point yeah for your anticipation and i think it's good to do it uh soon if especially if you want to you know try to make it more visible i think it makes sense it's not like pointing to the youtube video every time but like point to the page so that people can just visit that page where it has iframe to the latest video or the live stream yeah yeah that's true you should have a domain no did we talk about this idea that like i mean i hate to buy a new domain because then you have to pay forever yeah i don't know how you work domain from my from the signing art i have that and do you have a space in glitch or how you work with that i mean glitch is something that you open a new project and it becomes a sub domain so like whatever docked yeah i mean but you can also like buy uh like subscribe i mean to pay a premium account or something you know you can also no i mean like if you want to you have a new domain and just connect it to glitch app was that what you mean no i just i thought i i i haven't worked too much with glitch show no i was just speculating about that no because like for example like if i have this another domain uh that is not glitch but you know like i buy something i don't know bestpractices.com and then i can link that to the glitch project that's also possible but then you have to get a domain like i just don't like to have a domain because then you have to pay again again you cannot like once you release it and then it's gone and i hate that idea that that link goes uh and then link disappears i just don't like it so but then if you want to have let's say you want to have a page like a domain then they like to host side to side the live streamings at the tool to latest uh practice then if we put it in glitch what will be the domain of that something dot glitch dot me and then there after that you can name something yeah you can slash whatever like like as you like yeah but then i have no problem then we can just put best practices afterwards or yeah i mean you can have this best practices not glitch not me that's i mean i actually have it already yeah so that's possible i think it's nice uh if like i don't i won't i like these days what i do is to this one is empty but um use the subdomain and nothing like after uh the domain like no slash something because this looks cleaner and it looks like a legit url and this is and this is linked to so if i want to edit that page like if this is linked to your account yeah but i can invite you if you want so we can both edit i mean also like like i also got this domain called glitches me so i can open something there as well but then we can use github or whatever like how do you edit what's the easiest way for you um if to really use urls i think always i have just i have used my ui i just have the designing art thing but i haven't used so much let's say no i don't know i will use portfolio i will not use i will use let's say when i'm doing exercises like it was more for the school then i will do it through glitch or something else i guess yeah because you have to write like html and css and javascript and stuff right yeah not like a web platform that you can you know edit something on the on their interface no we no no that's something that i did from my website maybe four years ago like they're designing our website that's that i coded like maybe four years do you ago glitch account i should ha i think it should be linked let me try to it should be linked to my github so uh which um hi there glitch so login with github yes it's funny because when i open my github account for some reason i type jorge so without error so it's like joke giorgio or something and sometimes i get confused i'm trying to type my password or my jorgie and it's not working and i get pissed off because i'm not using it very often and then i like okay that's mine uh this is mine yeah so i don't know i this is my chat no i will just enter this in facebook [Music] that's my page i think that's my no but that goes to the the how to say dashboard you need to uh click on your icon at the top right it shows like add something okay so what is my my name then it's weird because then my name my username it comes from github so my username is guevara georgie this is funny but can you send it to me how exactly it yeah wait i'm just sending you a picture this is fine but on glitch i need a glitch first so i can invite you that's my that's my glitch that's my glitch you see my username is gevara joje but my glitch name is that guevara jorge it's very confusing that's weird i think it's like the screen name like the you know at is the real like id so then how should i do that in okay click and clicking account nobody just opens this burger side burger thing number menu wait let me figure out this it's okay i i sent you the invite okay this should be yeah is [Music] yeah i already sent you an invite uh where did i see these things forum account settings where do i see this you should get an email actually notification okay let me check glitch now here i having by to join product okay and this website is based practice says what now what is the readme okay no this is the yeah i'll just delete everything um oh i forgot how i can do the new file yes play this is uh show so what is this show i gotta show them next to code yeah yes and then i okay now i see it uh show me this okay now i see the website am i is this correct right here yeah okay i get it all right so we should put this to uh to to iframe they right yeah okay let's use that i mean i say like let's use this as the website yep then it's easy and yeah and actually then thinking of my okay but this is something that i should do i need to i will create a git repository because i need to i need to hand in some my code source and this kind of things in my school so i guess i will just create a uh a standard repository for this it's annoying yeah i mean they're not gonna ask but that will be the the proper way for me to do it for the school it's like using the github uh you can link this to a github yeah yeah of course i can export it to github right it's it's glitchy not glitchy but um this page i wouldn't really try to connect to github like the problem is you can can you export to github no i don't think so no i think it's the other way around you can you can import you can i think you can do both but if you import from github it basically erases everything and just like uh copies from github so let's not do it unless we are sure what we do but just keep this page as a just like a web page like not to add like contents too much you know like scripts and stuff on this it's just page page to show it and if we do some other web stuff we can host it on other glitch project or heroku or whatever you want but like not on this one so that the code is not here you just have a link on this page yeah youtube and i was thinking that i will so i will i will create a github a project anyway yeah and then then ideally then we could we should it's just like then we fork that project for what for just i don't know i mean that's the way what they teach me i don't know what even i'm talking about like when i was working that then just you create a github and then then just we work in different um yeah you you for the project and then you do changes if you want and then it's not affecting the the main one yeah if it's yours you don't have to i mean yeah i don't know it's but for this page i don't think we need a good repository but i bet okay maybe i don't need a repository but what i will need is i can download this as a as a folder right it's a kit kit project yes yeah okay then i can do it so it becomes a folder right yeah it has a git uh metadata in it so you can just like upload it to youtube github directly from there well you can download it or directly whichever you like but but just just just like saying that don't import github into glitch that will up everything okay good to know uh all right cool good i might edit this page a little bit to add some you know archive of what we do but i mean what i suggest but i would suggest read me index what i will suggest this should be is that it just should be wide frames like side to side okay that's great yeah do that and then but and then maybe you could use the i guess in the iframe you set the plate and both at the same time how you synchronize that in in the last page um it's possible if if we know the time stamp and stuff but how did you how do you synchronize the the time in the previous page because it's because we have the time it is so we show the time so i can manually but that's manual thing i have to do it afterwards like and we're talking about this to show the live streaming so it doesn't really work yeah yeah so we can add like a like a little script so that whenever you hit play on one video then it will trigger another video as well ah okay that i can do okay i can slave yeah so then if you move one of the playheads the other one will just go there but that doesn't work because it's live stream because we don't know i mean you can't but i i don't think it's really i think no no i think that this should be just simple it's the website to put in side to side their live streams and that's it yeah yeah and so the other thing i think i will do is to check this live stream i'm going to test it try to perform informative like if is it different for me or what does it change like wait if use if you use wait if you're streaming from obs to just me on my channel on the same uh if i if i'm streaming from obs what i can do is just reuse that link right if that's what you told me the last time beca this is something that i'm still confused with this is if i'm streaming uh creating a new stream every time from youtube of course the url will change will be a new url every time right but if i'm streaming with the key from obs i can reuse the code i can reuse the key i can reuse the url right the whatever settings in obs is remains the same the stream key unless you change it it will be always the same if you make a new streaming so that's that's to say that just every time that you create a new stream but then this then the stream url changes right url is different but uh the key probably like yeah okay better because i was thinking like how to just put the iframe in certain way that it's just one url and then we can just reuse it but i think if you have i think it's not for everyone i think you have to have like certain amount of subscribers then you can set uh like a permanent link for the streaming i think that's my that's my understanding but curious yeah because that was what i was thinking what i thought to put this the iframes i mean to one what i was thinking on the website was always i was thinking how to not we have to do manually every time to copy paste the the urls there because it's just not effective at all yeah for example like if you ah sorry these guys the the ones who do like uh light coding streaming i sent you on facebook they have this permanent link uh but you send me a link of a playlist yeah so i think when they're doing the streaming i think it goes to the streaming live streaming but because they're offline now so it just goes to the okay no no no no because it's the same but then you have to be wait then it will just automatically appear if there is something happening there i mean if there is still happening i think so but i don't know how if they can actually embed like that i'm not sure maybe it doesn't work that way but anyways i think you need certain amount of subscribers to make these links on youtube no because i think when when you are just when i'm just you i don't know how many subscribers do you have like 200 and i think if i have three i have three and one of them so it's not gonna work yeah um if you have like above like like more than 100 i think you can make a link for your channel so i have my link to my channel but i don't have a link to my live stream i don't know how it works maybe i can i don't know but i never tried it um okay but this is okay let's do like this let's start putting let's start just putting just the two iframes together and just we update the the url and that's it yeah it's easy you know if you start the live stream you just take that part of the id and just put it in the iframe it's not it's not too difficult like extra work but it's it's just copy and paste so for example like oh then but then it has to be it has to be floating it so it has to be not block but it has to be i do great looking in line right but i use grid and it's it works quite well i don't know why i don't remember how i would do it i don't remember my styles on the investors index is this is the project so i just put two blocks okay and css embedded eat this it ridiculous i a container in here is this division absolutely relative why position relative weight hundred height but imagine a bit it's a youtube video actually sing so i mean this works do you if you preview it show in the window show me huh listen maybe this is i will try it oh yeah now it's working um [Music] yeah this is it yeah and we just have to change source url this is it and then we can use this is best practices in web page making yeah this is this is the best this is the best website no but not being objective like after doing this this is just looks amazing this website looks super clean yeah we should apply for our web design design yeah i mean it is a practice because i do it all the time like this like this is really specific thing i don't make any menus where i don't make any fancy stuff you know like iframe and you know synchronize time and stuff that's what i do with that's my best practice design and do you know like if you shrink the the width of the window it becomes like one margin know what like when you shrink the the window yeah then it becomes one column oh yeah because you made them uh you make them float uh yeah yeah yeah there's a response yes i love these things it's the trancy what did you put it yeah i say yeah greet outer rose mean max yeah yeah i don't understand this but that works it works yeah yeah the way i learn it was in a different way but it it's just the same after it goes a certain way just it jumps yeah i think uh responsiveness yeah with the float i think it's uh good when you don't know how many items you have but this is interesting i was thinking today when i was taking a shower that it is interesting that i slowly started having more space in my head because i was thinking a bit in the website of that woman yesterday and and some and and i think like start like doing something more let's say more code wise could be interesting also uh because one hand is like i think that i don't know but it's i mean i i should know because i have i have done that for 40 years you know there's one thing that is like constantly i'm kind of afraid to not do it because i don't know but i have i i studied this thing so this is one thing and the other thing i is positive in my limitation is because my knowledge is not the same in years is what actually could potential uh the interaction because if we both we will speaking from the same point of knowledge there it's just not interesting uh yeah yeah so the i was thinking that today reflecting about like that would be interesting to do a bit more of this uh tracking qualities exercise that you have been doing um yeah but i need i need more space not because i'm so busy with many things at the same time so but then it's something that's now yeah but it's something that like today when i'm staying in the shower i thought because i was reflecting on the website of the woman yesterday of the month that's also the same platform as the one that i shared before the this dissertation whatever that this guy did with uh like layout and things i shared before right yeah yeah it's the same in the same platform yeah yeah so i think it's cool i think it's i think it's nice to um i think it's called this also i think also something that's interesting like yeah like then i i talked to who uh yeah maybe just you do what you say because maybe mine's a bit longer okay yeah i'm just saying that uh with the web i think uh it's nice to have joanna because she does those weird stuff yeah yeah i'm sure like she really knows how to work with css like the last time i worked with cs that's weird because you remember like i followed this what what is that i paid for this bootcamp on javascript the last year i paid and i was doing that so with javascript i'm more i'm more confident because that was and with css like and that was the thing that i'd lose my subject in development because i did not pay attention to the design uh so i did not pay attention to the design because i thought yeah it's exactly but it's complicated that says it's just you have to practice it uh then this year that that's what i i my website that's why i spent some time with the sun because i thought like okay this time i need to make it work nicely so the website that when i share it with you it looks nice and stuff because then i spent some time with the css but of course like in the iterations i have been doing more iterations with javascript so javascript is something that i feel more comfortable note on packages and the language would be more uh yeah i will understand but css i start like you know for instance already i was thinking to the website i know there is greed and flexbox because i learn it but then i will just start trying to make it just floating you know like just not block by blocking line or something uh because of the sim because of what the website needs um because of my because i don't have so many iterations using css which is yeah learning code is just iterations in the language iteration iteration like at anything else but that's to say wait that when i talked with an elena that was what i was going to share like the weird website that she had then i was asking here what the  is that and then she was saying that that's a project actually that she's working on and she has for for them i think for this year where she basically she's trying to exercise something with the website when she's inviting people trying to come together there what is interesting is like they're working so far for instance like they're not working with a developer so then she uses a template from beats or one of the templates and then when she was saying that i felt like this is actually a very um yeah very more yeah it's like an art in in the sense like very artistic approach because she's really squeezing i don't know how she's how she's i have never worked with these templates so i cannot imagine those things that i saw in the website that are so weird i cannot imagine how to see them in the template because i will try to picture them in code or i mean through say but um signified yeah actually like i i looked into it a little bit because i was curious how it's made and uh i think she just uses like uh illustrator or photoshop or whatever just make so many images and they're like you know like for example like there's text that like kind of bleeding from the the text that you know repeats a lot and uh it looks a bit like you know not glitchy but uh i was curious how it's made and it's just like a single image and it totally makes sense it's one image yeah so it's so it's just one video a video or like you know i mean the whole thing is one image but you know they're like what looks complicated is actually like just like one image paste it there uh but it looks doing it the complexity to the the page which is really small yeah yeah yeah yeah but i think it's very very interesting like i was talking with her and i was surprised when she said like that because she was telling me she was trying to say like maybe maybe you're interested maybe in to work something with this and [Music] and then and yeah and then she was telling me what she was doing and i was very surprised and so like so they they haven't worked with that with a coder yet with a developer and in a way that she's searching for that and then i'm getting one hand actually maybe you don't want to go there it's ultimately i don't know you know because because because so far it works like the the thing that it was in my head that is like i'm trying to share is that she's proposing an exercise basically it's like a meeting place where in her words is like the home page is like an entry to communicate with her something like that she says so the idea that she invites some people she's shared the passwords and stuff and then the landing page is always a new message basically for her in the sub within a code or cipher because then people will always constantly alter this home page or something um but then she was saying that but then of course i was trying like i don't understand how you still can have a functional website uh because i was thinking from the code you know if just somebody forgets to put a comma or something that is just not working and then she told me like no act so this is actually it's a template ah of course then you can actually just it up around them and yeah that was a very i was not expecting that to hear that very cool yeah i think i i really think it's smart and still yeah makes a lot of complexity on the other hand like i was i found it so funny like um i i have we have this uh mailing list of the school or people outside the school or whatever they just you know right uh i'm i'm looking for a room or i'm looking for a roommate and uh you know i have furniture to sell and sometimes uh there's like a gig you know i'm looking for a camera person whatever and one of them i found a few days ago was no no no this is just something that was because because uh oh yeah because the video or the streaming of it got a bit glitchy so i wasn't sure if you're talking or it's from something else anyways what i want to say is someone wrote to the the mailing list that she's looking for a programmer so i'm not interested but i just took a look because i was curious what kind of program she wants and she's basically saying that i need to redo my website and i was like should do to redo what her website yeah static portfolio and she's looking for programmer and i found it so funny i mean it makes sense but like you know how people relate to these words occupations roles functions it's very but but i think i think it's very interesting because i was having this conversation with with her and then she was saying that she has a lot of problems um when she she works a lot with technology she's she's kind of one of these people i think she has a good network so then they call her from bibington for the technical part like so from dance companies or theater companies or do complex projects and and she has she hasn't studied anything um so and she she knows how to work if i understood well is that she works a lot i guess with after effects and she has some what training as musician once she was a child but that's it and she dropped the school when she was in the musical school at some point and then uh but that's the the whole her only training but i think is very uh that kind of admired from her from what she's told me is that she is very flexible because so they invite her to in a company theater dance and then in between let's say a pause or something where the dancers or the actors are doing something she's putting things together really fast and then creating the video on almost like rendering the video in i don't know how long it takes it you know like something that it might take me the whole night she's just really she's a very flexible and she's putting things without thinking too much and boom uh and like in 10 minutes or something she has something that that she can use life in the moment and and that i think that's a really incredible exercise like flexibility you know um because it comes i mean she also told me about her bit of her path because she has no she has learned through tutorials basically so she has no access to formal education therefore she just learned what she thinks is worth it and it it's incredible flexible in in in in the way how she approaches these tools uh and yeah so but then i was mentioned that because then she was sharing her frustration with developers and the art artists and this uh more people that really knows about uh some things that she cannot do um uh because of in her world because of the lack of imagination of a developer or somebody who works in vr in the sense of like you tell me what to do like it's just the problem that you have with technicians you know like if you tell me and i also understand because i work as well doing technical work you if you choose to do that work not always but many times it's because you don't want to maybe the creation part you just want to be commanded for a task where i can apply my creativity and that's fine but don't come to me with the politics about what i want to do because that's maybe not that's why i'm doing the technician work and all the artistic work uh and that's basically kind of like sharing yeah yeah i i think it's it's um something i learned over time like especially like well in her case uh she's not a developer so that's that's good anyway because as a developer you have to learn like how to um not to sabotage but how to make things um easier so that you can you don't have to develop basically because yeah in a production you don't have time to develop something and you have to uh do you have to be lazy and that's that's something i i learned and that always gives better results than trying to do it straight forward yeah yeah completely yeah completely i understand that yeah yeah as an artist you will try to do everything yourself in a way like you will try to like you just make something so complicated all the time uh that's the exercise of the artist but it's true then when working with technical stuff then just like for instance doing this work with marco i knew normally the art direction but then i said okay this is the money i told him i'm just doing live design and video mapping and that's it you know and then while i was mounting and then working with the clothes and then i hear the sound you know like other things from the aesthetics i intuitively i was trying to go there but then i slow myself down like hey you know what i need to do this i can just do this work with my people this is fine and so just like be more like the lazy you know like just like i just do well paid for uh still doing it the best that i can but i'm not gonna just do the other thing that's a good thing i don't have to do it and i think it works it works better for the production in that case yeah i mean in my case like you know um yeah like what i want to say is like you don't have to use you know crazy tools expensive software to do things you know especially i think the problem with artists and uh like dancers choreographer whatever they want to work with technology they come up with idea that they like for example they want to use vr but then maybe it's something that you don't need vr to do it like you know you need you think about sensors to like this i think i already told you before but one of the case was that a dancer friend he wanted to make a piece that reacts to the body movement of the dancers and he was thinking about using sensors but i said you know like you don't have to do it you just have to use a webcam to track the body and then i just like made it down like you know a few hours and then it was actually used in the actual installation so um yeah like you have to be oh i don't like the word creative but creative to be lazy and how to cut cost and yeah i mean but at the same time you know like i understand this that you're saying and i have subscribed to this idea but at the same time then we go back to the uh domain of ecologies and because then if you really think about it what you're suggesting is that basically how to say this is basically you have these two this is because it's there is an asymmetrical relation in in in the relation so then it's like basically there is there are two uh subjects uh then you have the technical part who know actually about the technical so about the technical part which knows about tools yeah and then so yes technology who knows about tools and then you have on the other side the artists who don't know about those tools but has an idea and not has shape very often and then it's it is again the same idea to the of the grant and the application that you basically needs to need to shape something that is abstract in your head as an artist in order to perform in this case not for a realtor but for the technician to make something working and of course in this because is that the tool is something to give you something back directly then you need actually to be as concrete as possible or try to find a better wording and for the technical part to offer you maybe as you said the right tool because the technical is it this technology who will decide for you what might be better because it's also if i think if a technician if the technician in that side is doing a good job and not just being closed then it will be uh honest in you know saying like i think in my just let's try this one but also knowing that it should be involved in the process with the artisan trying to as much as possible make it easy for the artist to try to translate a bit of this you know like what is actually the artist needs to know like in terms of the black box idea the artist might don't need to know how the website works but maybe my needs to know work how the art works for whatever reason because of the play forever you know so those things the technician has the responsibility in a way to share or to dissect what is the information that i need to share in order to make this relation fruitful for everyone yeah i just remember that in like one of the early chat that we talked about like kind of the service you know like the technician as a you know service rather than contributing to the artistic process i don't know how it how he framed it but that's that's something yeah but i think what you said totally makes sense i mean that's what i wanted to say in that conversation because yeah i mean otherwise you know it's just not happy for everyone that technicians try to do something useless and you know nothing is delivered and artists not happy technician is not happy so i think it will be like makes sense to have like a consultant or tech technical manager or something that can communicate between artists and uh technicians and try to find what's the what's true what the right tools and stuff that's something that is not people don't think that's something something but i think that kind of story yes yeah so that kind of role would be so useful i think uh i would do that you're saying it makes sense this is what you're saying makes a lot of sense like thinking in in the current panorama and i mean from our from our problem uh this thing that we prefer often then i think it makes so much sense like this position that doesn't exist uh should exist in these frameworks say is not necessary if what you need to do is just like in the theater you know that's just a classical use of the technician that you don't need to have a consultant in technology right so you don't there is no point but if your attempt as an artist is trying to use technology technology and then diving through the tools then you then the disposition of having somebody somewhat knowledgeable uh in technology will help you navigate that and that's at the position that doesn't exist right and it makes sense so necessary that's actually i think i told you about this project but i i was telling to my collaborators because they were they wanted to make a platform for the like because they worked with a huge um group of people so the idea was to have make a platform like web platform like a concrete web platform that people can look in and practice uh for the performance but i was telling them you know you don't have to make a platform from scratch so you're not you shouldn't look for like a like a javascript full stack developer because you don't know what to tell them what to make basically you cannot just hire a developer and say you know we have this idea so can you make this platform doesn't work that way um but at the same time i was i was involved in the project for other role like very concrete development so i said you know i don't want to be technical manager so you have to look for first look for a technical manager who can guide you to find if what's the right technology and what's what's the right people to work and i don't know if they got the idea but that's that's so that's yeah yeah yeah but and you told me about this process before you told me about this before right yeah yeah yeah it's all about this yeah yeah yeah yeah i mean but it just the thing is we're still are maybe i don't know how long it will take but we are still in the place where the technology is the tool therefore i mean it's like it serves the purpose of the artist so it just is it's a political relation with again with the symmetry because the artists know then even if you don't know you know but it's just coming from the blasting idea of the artist is the true in the in the political spectrum of uh i mean performing culturally you know cultural uh culturally let's say culture says the theater is the space architecturally where art happens and then inside of the theater then the choreographer or the director is the one who knows he is the one who is entitled to the apparatus to apply resources and knowledge the rest of them are in a different that in a in a in in they are in a symmetrical position in relation to the artists so then often very often than the artist because as well as busy doing other stuff then it will have great ideas crappy ideas just ideas and then it will just put them out just as vomit often you know like just a brainstorm and then maybe not the right person then sometimes with a technician and the technician doesn't want to deal with that like i said but it wants maybe something else um but then it's because the artist doesn't know it doesn't have the knowledge of that actually i need to take time with you because actually that's the problem like first in my my word with marco sometimes he he at some point he understood and as much as possible he tried to give me space but it yeah it was not enough but still he tried to make a space to listen to what the video mapping was it because he just had the idea of video mapping and the video mapping and the 360 mapping and then just like these ideas and so at some point that he tried to slow down and just really listen to to to what actually is and why not why yes or this kind of things so what i'm trying to say is that still we are in a place where if we stop if you speak about performance art or theater or dance then the technologies it comes from the technical side so into the service of the artist and there is not space to see that as more than merely a tool that you know is like not really important for the process although it is really important because without the light you don't see the thing you know it's just it's just it's just a granted thing but you really if there is no sound and you need a sound and you're you know just something that is like granted yeah yeah i mean i think there are a few problems like especially in theater like traditionally it was a service and now it's not because i mean it but today people think that it is a service you know when they need a video projection projection mapping 360 mapping with 360 sound they think that it's just like you know you order it and there it is and you plug it and you plug it and then you put play in the computer and that's how it works yeah and then the body will be tracked and uh hologram will appear yeah and the same in this theater than in the next theater and so on exactly with light no light we want to use like projection mapping in the summer you know like this kind of thing yeah can you project black color um anyways um and the other thing is the you know that the technical people are like they don't speak up so often so that's uh other yeah i think that's you know i mean [Music] i i do you know i often complain and you know fight a lot and uh that is not always fun but but at least i have you know this ego or whatever um but it's not often the case so i mean that's also the asymmetry that you said you know it's not people don't regard the technical people as important as they are so it's hard for them to speak up but yeah i mean i don't know um i mean we do what we do so i think it's good yeah at least i mean but but i think it's at least it's just good like i mean not sorry like i think that i completely agree there's if somebody wants to work with technology you know like if somebody want to go in that domain then this position should exist actually something that is a consultant or something around that spectrum and actually it doesn't have to be somebody who really knows about you it doesn't have to be a developer for us no i know a friend of mine like ken who has a company about technologies and stuff like that he knows so much about things that i don't know because that's what he loves to do he really he's really in the state of the art and technologies and he's checking he's not a developer meaning that he don't know how to deploy them but he he's in technology so yeah so that would be your man you know yeah that's the thing like it's not it doesn't have to be a developer and it's not that developer is not sufficient to do that to do that job no that's that's really important yeah yeah true and that's why i think that's something that is very specific that is very twisted between in my conversation with i think and elena that i guess that was something that i cannot articulate but it was that that the image that she has of developer is that that person who knows about technology which is not is not necessarily the case the developer is somebody who knows about the tool and specifically certain tools but yeah so yeah i i completely agree with what you said yeah because that creates misunderstandings yeah yeah and that's why people ask for web uh the for programmer when they want to do portfolio anyways um but that's funny like this is funny um i need to do a full stab web i need i'm searching for a full of stack web developer for my portfolio yeah with the top.net and uh what else yeah i have i have four pictures i think i should be using webgs web dsl website open dslr yeah all these things together can you do it also i think uh she didn't say anything about the budget so probably like she can she pays from her pocket like you know 20 bucks or 30 bucks for 100 years like something like no like 50 or something at most oh my god this is really fun like i feel so ashamed because i'm coming from like being an artist and ask favors to people who work in technology one of the reasons why i decided to study that was because i want to be independent but i was asking often favors to friends who very kind they end up doing these things but it's just as you said like i will just consider maybe i just pay 50 euros for their web stack development you know this is crazy yeah yeah okay but we should stop here that was funny we have best practices we uh i by the way while we were talking i changed the title and now it's it looks i started liking this i don't know if you like it i started liking more like the hashtag best practice in contemporary dance that's something that i started using with no space yeah we don't pages hashtag you know hashtag baseball every single day dance because we demands we love a bit of attention you know like you have to what the is that yeah okay um yeah what is that yeah okay good so yeah uh fingers crossed for the application and uh more applications because we are still waiting for them i'm reading and doing these different things like that's also writing about the practice so so i'm sure just be jumping for this conversation that we have i think could be nice like to upload it it was nice yeah i don't know if we actually uploaded it yeah i don't want to edit so because this is like something that i don't think but buddy having for how long you have been recording this it's quite long but i'll see let's see let's see but it's it's nice to upload somehow so well i will think because we i think this we actually i was thinking about it we touched some yeah yeah it was a nice conversation yeah so please like the video and subscribe because we don't know what are we doing that's what we are succeeding in this because we have no clue what we are doing this is so good yeah please subscribe now because this is going to be online right now and and subscribe to foreign three subscribers and two of them are actually myself one is me and i think the other one is my brother but i'm subscribed i i didn't subscribe oh really i okay thank you now subscribe to my channel i appreciate it okay please subscribe to my channel [Laughter] okay this is the best practice website that we already launched is is we are best practicing in web design being live there daily and revisit day day by day we are in the state-of-the-art web design exactly check it out okay see you soon yes have a nice day", "kC-7hzK0jgM": "oh is that a problem with my headset or can you hear me right now no no i can't yes yeah yeah i was having problems with my internet it's still like i don't know what's happening um yeah what's up what's up stop i i was just yeah i was just makeup session how he's putting some makeup i don't know he's a bit bitter but it's glitter but in the tone of my skin so you see that's not too strong yeah yeah subtle but gorgeous gorgeous of course yes i i like to feel like this today it's very sunny here so it's very nice i mean it's like 20 degrees which is yeah the last days i mean also from tomorrow will start raining so this is the maximum i don't know how is in germany it's a similar situation oh yeah it's actually the same like 22 degrees and then tomorrow it's rain and then it's going to be after tomorrow it's going to be a bit low and you stay like this for the whole week more than more than a week it seems yeah yeah yeah i mean until the app can go until yeah exactly exactly yeah yeah but i don't i don't trust the apple uh app people i don't know me too like apple is the worst of them like yeah apple is there i mean i don't chose like the webcasts also that are really unpredictable but apple is the thing is the worst yeah right but which one do you use i use um the one that i have i mean the one that i was checking this is the weather app from yeah i just checked first and then i also use yeah exactly but i also use metal blue which is really cool because it has this radar that shows you know like uh for the next one hour or so yeah yeah yeah it's more trustable yeah yeah i agree yeah yeah i used some ar radar also but it was working amazingly until they changed the version and now in a way you have to i mean you have to buy before you could use it really well i mean just for the reader uh let's say you don't have layers or things like this you know uh but the radar will work with the cloud and stuff but they have upgraded the app and now you have to yeah you basically you have to upgrade to premium i see it's so horrible how people do these things no it seems to me like the company's marketing strategy like fishing now they're fishing you they give you a good service for i mean i understand what they do like for maybe 10 days one month but i have that for more than three years i think the same version and now they just wanted to i don't know and then i i feel very abused with that happen when you are having a service that is you know for a certain time and yeah you're a royal user yeah i mean even yeah i mean i i use it yeah i don't have the premium version but i use it that's the my radar that's the one that i will trust yeah i was just thinking we should do that like for the practice that uh for for the first one month you can watch it for free and if you subscribe you can get like more content this is best practices in business i'm pretty sure like i mean in copyrights and no where was it yeah and copyrights one of the things that then you learn with in the model of uh hacking and ethical hacking and stuff like that was about fishing and all these modalities they are like to basically scam you and that companies also do like legally to get your data and basically to you up yeah yeah yeah um i don't know if this will be uploaded i don't know if somebody's watching or i'm sure i'm sure at least now jorge are there there somewhere in future present somewhere maybe they're watching maybe jorge is watching maybe not watching might be working watching but maybe in delay they don't even know about it yeah like imagine if you you know retire i don't know what that means and then you don't have anything to do so you just start watching all these uh chat from from this time i don't know how many videos will accumulate by then but um i started writing so i i started checking i was checking the document yesterday and i wrote i put something in the hybrid document today also and what's about unknowing uh i call it wait maybe first i want to refer to something you mentioned in the in the document oh my god i have so many documents because i'm writing now there are like literally more than [Music] 15 20 small documents that's just a mess um uh yeah just i remember i remember that you were mentioning in the text in that in japanese that you don't use present verb you know like i do in spanish or you do in english you know like like to say i'm hungry you said i am hungry you cannot say hungry that means nothing but if you said in japanese apparently just hungry you can you can you can use it as a as a word then i found very interesting that um because of the wait let me try to simplify it and i'll make densities because i'm trying to say that is yeah so it makes me think like uh vulvar in spanish means to come back and volver is actually the name of my company of like yeah the organization where i've uh invoiced my things and stuff it's called volver and it was a project that we started at some point with my couple because then at some point we were traveling in europe and we always were coming back home and that's something that also stays it's something that means a lot this idea like you always you return you know you come back always like for you come back these things you come back like if you're away from home you know like you you will come back so at some point because that's yeah that's that's how it goes i don't know why but we live in loops apparently i don't know um and then in in regards to that then i wrote something that it was about the unknown uh what is the document which one uh yeah about practice on pro practice in times of uncertainty uh yes one of my subcategories it's called bulbar sp which i'm trying to propose as you know if you use a different language i don't know if you can see the document right now yeah i open it you see like what it says like the subtitle bulbar and then brackets sp i mean like as spanish as spanish so somehow like to propose that if you use words in other language maybe we can do it in certain in that way or i mean we just propose um yeah and basically i just wrote about this uh unknowingness that is about possibility and about practicing to not know uh that's in soon what i'm trying to say in the document basically and and to question they i mean is to not know no first i think it's starting from questioning but from the sake of question you know like just not questioning as an active uh advisoring of rationality and trying to answer what is the question but a question for the sake of questioning which is a practice in itself yeah and that's that's the way i wanted to to start sharing that with you yeah it's always difficult to make a good question that's um something in itself is definitely a practice and um in an academic context which i talk about all the time these days i feel i'm not in academic position or in a way i'm in a post-grad school so it's academic in a way but what i want to say is i was once at um academic conference where it was engineering so it's really rigid like if you question if you ask questions like there are talks like you know you present your paper your research uh for let's say 15 minutes and then you have q a for five minutes and in this context usually it's really um like what people ask is very rigid let's say you did you made this program then people would ask you know what kind of framework you used um this kind of question it's it's really like there is an answer to it um but then there was this um usually like in the conferences conference or the track uh chair who's uh the emcee and you know manages the um time and you know um if there's no question then he's gonna or they wanna ask questions because you know that's also it's there to facilitate um or animate in other languages and this guy so the talk was about um robots that fight against each other or it's it's like a it's like a video game that you shoot each other but with uh with robots like actual robots with ar yes i think it's a nice project it was really uh like a more like a student project but still it's nice and then no one asked questions so this conference the chair asked a question because he had to what he said was what do you think about drones killing people and that i found that was really a nice question because it's just like opens up whole another topic and it's not really about the research itself i mean it is the research itself but it's like a fundamental part of it but it's not about what programming you used or you know like this kind of concrete question and uh and i think the answer was something like you know the researchers against this kind of thing and that's why they may wanted to make it more playful instead of killing people but there's like since like that was really like the moment i thought that is the question it's not like if you have a small question you know how you want to if you want to know a very specific thing that there is an answer then you can just come to the speaker after the conference or you know when there's like a dinner or something there's always place to network but in this open space because it's shared with other people it's a place to plant something rather than crop i don't know but it's always hard yeah but i think it's because it it has to be with this you know if you speak from the people from your experience in a conference so when the frameworks are very defined you know like so like i mean it comes from this it comes from this idea of knowledge you know like and searching for knowledge so then basically yeah we yeah we fight conf we find comfort in knowledge basically because if you go to there and i mean it's it's just natural that's what we do know like we that's actually your consciousness in in in in in in action that's not the body but that's the that's the that's that's the master that's not the sleepless them does the mind that's my consciousness trying to make sense for my ease basically that uh yeah it's like it's so difficult beyond the uncertainty basically it's difficult to be on the uncertainty in one hand but what it makes it more complicated is when you are sharing uncertainty with people then you start suffering let's say in a conference if somebody doesn't know what it wants to ask it makes feel everybody uncomfortable because it comes from uncertainty at some point someday weeks ago i was checking about positive structuralism and ah derrida and idea of destruction actually like from black pro when it was proposed that it comes from him i didn't know this idea of like this deconstructs things that that's a that's a term that i use very often in art and like idea deconstruct and to layer something in different ways this idea and it comes from this uh post structuralism um and it's proposed by derrida and one of the things that he says uh from things that i was reading is that in his philosophy basically it's very clear that actually they somebody's a human maturity is no i mean you can you can see like somebody's intelligent uh mature enough when you don't know and i've never heard of that like that very that this philosophy was one of the first if not the first person who's saying that if you are mature if you're intelligent mature enough you understand that things make no sense in a way and are very complex there is no one-sided answer therefore then just when you are mature enough you understand that there is just a deconstruction of infinite uh possibilities solutions environments lives frameworks and so on that is life itself so that he was saying that that when you are in conversation with somebody a mature intelligent conversation what you don't know is not a sign of weakness but it's a sign actually of your maturity intellectually because it just shows that you understand that things are not one-sided and that's something that i mean it's just i mean it's kind of you know if we talk of this it seems like it makes sense you know like you don't have to be super i don't know like it makes sense but at the same time it's something that i didn't hurt or i didn't even thought about it you know it's something that you give for granted you know like oh yeah the world's complex i am complex i uh this is just complex but you don't really think about it actually if i don't understand something i cannot explain myself many times when i speaking with you or with somebody else it doesn't mean that i'm stupid which often i think or that i just yeah my with my own limitations with my own traumas but it just means that that's my maturity speaking from me and it's just interesting i just really like to say like because this speaks about uncertainty and sharing the space of like you know you know what i don't know now you know like i don't know but that's what i think is cool what we do because we already we are we are comfortable sharing things that we don't know uh so going back to the example of the conference and then the example again of when somebody cannot choose what is the question makes everybody unstable and uncertain like it just feels awkward right i don't know this whole whole yeah i think that itself has many layers i don't fully understand so i don't know if it's uh right to say this is already uncertainty in myself but the knowledge itself becomes very abstract and unstable the topic itself what we're talking about is not something that we find the truth i think i like this word because i can blame everything when i say the truth that's that's the word that bears everything um but also that we have like a blade yeah scapegoat that the other thing is that we acknowledge ourselves that we don't know it's not that we try to defend our positions by saying something but it's we just leave it to each other or future selves or whoever wants to understand it but i don't have to you know defend my position or my standpoint yeah i mean that's that's really important because i like the school started again so i go to seminars and sometimes i really feel uncomfortable that someone's really you know someone's really smart but they're trying to defend their position their view and they know that there should be discussion but still they don't give the space to talk about it all right i mean to be honest like if i can interrupt like that's because it makes me think again of buff you know western i'm like this every century you come here then it's like i don't think to to be honest and when we speak about this abstraction of knowledge there is actually less thing but more to feel and it's more about to embody that space which still will be framed within let's say worse if you want to talk with other person and so on um but still i think it has to be more with sensibility and just slowing down and yeah basically give a space to actually maybe not have the right and be in a different uh perform perform activity or i don't know like you know like aiming to i know i know i have the last word you know like am i right i'm right this is the truth um yeah this is interesting you know like feeling because yesterday i was listening try to find some podcast dance related podcast i shouldn't say anything bad because there are not many dance related podcasts so uh but but this podcast was not really really well done like the host was talking about before the interviewer comes um it's not really well organized just you know what i would say in the first one or two minutes and then you know go on to the topic uh but they were talking about it for like 20 minutes questioning themselves but what they're talking about and then it's like a loop of you know um not sure about what they're doing and then the the the guest comes and the host should you know if you're a host you should you know have at least a dialogue it's not that you have your guests and uh you just keep talking but they are like that a little bit uh at first at least like uh they could just you know jump into the topic but they're talking about themselves for a few minutes and then uh ask questions but the question is not clear so they started explaining again which was pretty bad but then i was quite like thinking like you know but this made me think a lot about what is like makes me judge but that something i don't like uh about myself but i do judge it's good podcast or not good podcast but then if it's not good then why is it but then it makes me really think because it's not something that like for example like martin's podcast i listen to it i actually listen to it these days like um just repeatedly without too much attention but this is like that's really well done you know like uh it seems like he makes his music as well um and everything is well done um there may be something that could be improved but it's not like um you feel that something is um i don't know it could be a performance but it's a performance yes he announced it as a performance the other one i found it's really uh could be done well but then that's that's also like interesting like that made me think and sometimes like i feel let's say i see like a bad art i don't want to say it this way but the artwork that i let's say i don't like but then something is stuck in my mind because that's something really bad that made me think of so many things yeah and i'm just questioning like you know what what is this i mean i don't know if like if the way who i see myself like things i don't know yeah the way who i perceive art um seeing some time ago since since long ago i think is that and actually not our only art but my relationships like like path like things that really matter to me you know is things that i cannot define if i like it or not because otherwise i'm not interested and and like that also is with art um yeah of course i mean yeah like when there is something that is not defined for me in a way then then it's it's interesting let's say um so escapes they in a way they like it or not like it i will say more it goes more in a terrain of like how uncomfortable it makes me feel for instance you know like for instance there is one woman in seeds she's an interaction designer and she works a lot with 3d printing and uh she part of her work is very speculative of course and uh so she prototyped like humans in the future organs things like that so some things are very very very visceral like at some point in the video she was showing cutting an eye and stuff like that you know like very very visceral things that myself i'm very particularly sensible with that thing so for instance like that's something that makes me feel very uncomfortable uh yet uh yeah i can it's very it's a very interesting topic you know like what the way how she approached it and what he's doing uh then i will said i like it in a way you know or i found it more interesting like then my interest will still be on top of my own comfort and what i cannot handle let's say i just don't watch it but for the rest i then i just trying to figure out what is that she's trying to say i don't know someone's alarm or something i'm hearing um yeah i mean what i meant is like like first of all it's not well done like well that's like the the judging has to be really bad i mean you mean like in extremes something that you see is like okay that's not good streams or i don't know well in this podcast uh in that sense i i would say i put put it in the extreme that it was not really well done um it could have been executed well but you know sometimes you know artworks that is like let's say okay you know um like maybe they're something that could be done better but like sometimes you know it's just it's just not good you know it's not that you don't like it or you like it or not but it's it's just not well done um but then sometimes it's not well done but it's just makes me question a lot about why it's not well done like how can it be better to be done better and why do people think it's you know like how do we judge and this is like a big question like i feel like i i always question you know like what is curation and how people judge artworks and that always makes me uncomfortable that we do judge and i do somehow like at a glance i look at artwork give me a thing i need to check something oh yeah so i would change the topic i know okay no uh yeah okay so she's late like 10 minutes okay yeah because you have to go sorry no it's okay but seriously that's good ten minutes late enjoying the chat you know she's the person that i told you that um of the website that is so weird right so weird uh he's an artist she works more from sound i know her from the impulse dance from vienna and she's very well positioned i think and but i don't know like i see here she's very busy working more in germany with media more with sound and sound and performance in that spectrum working very often in vienna um anyway uh analina [Music] so what wait wait yeah okay so we were talking of this like okay maybe i would like to to see to i was thinking about the chat because i'm writing and i have my conversation with my promoter my school also from the project for the for the practice for the final work of my thesis yeah and then i was thinking that this idea of the chat um one thing was you propose what if we invite other people to join the chat which i think that will be very good and actually we can expand in that in overtime because the more lagging backstage because it's actually it's a very it has a lot of potential um we can invite it eventually martin he might join um then yeah the the chat for the for the in the framework of the of the best practice for the school what i thought and i wanted to propose to you to think what do you think is if at the end part instead of just you and me chatting what if we make a kind of like q and o version in uh via zoom or gt or something but then we link it i mean we still uh we put it through the stream then people have the chance to question and answer things you know you you said q and what you want q a q a yeah i said q and o yeah maybe that's nicer we should name it like that is like question and option yeah they do you know when you say that i was thinking like what can it be like or maybe a question on the question or something like that that you know because it's not a question and answer anyways no but i like this idea of question an option sure or we just leave it no no that's that's not that's my spanish english in my head yeah that's the translation that's what i think it's q and a is q and o that's what i say that's that's the context i guess in my head like you know often i do these things like but it happens when you is is is not your first language then you bastard bastard sentences like you know like things that a native speaker will set you know and once you get let's say fluent in the language then you will try to use it uh sometimes it doesn't work like that because it's you know like you need to it just comes from you grew up with that and then you can use it so then often or sometimes then i will say something and people are what do you mean with that like exactly like this i'm in q and a so it's q and o but anyway there's no answer so that's that's that's a good uh idea but so yeah that's to say that i showed two as well to the people to the promoter the guy said it was uh very nice it looks very good and uh we can have this converse more uh conversation in uh yeah in the coming days and also to talk about the the chat with uh guest speakers we can buy different people you know like that will be interesting uh on the idea of visibility also because i think we should reach out yeah yeah yeah i mean without being desperate without desperate desperation but i think we should push more like being out and then use networks to try to if you're watching please please yes please contact us please contact us and share the content please we are not this is not the bible but this is one of the options there is but if if you have enough followers we don't we don't take you if you only have you know 10 followers and anyways these people that i know like sometimes you know like i know i should not be doing good my instagram or things like people i know and melting pot like they were like you know 3 000 followers things like that you know and i'm like okay i have like 500 followers i don't know but i i guess i don't know how to use instagram um anyway uh but no i think maybe what i would like to say to close is that it seems clear to me that more often when as well hear from other people uh i i think we have something that is interesting that is is is more is yet fluid very solid in the sense of like we are around something that it it has shape uh it's grouping and ungrouping but it is is is an option it's a valid option these days so i think it would be because we have been doing this for so long it would be interesting that other people can have access to today's um yes so people share the word post and like the video of course like the video okay so bye bye we go backstage", "--ZI_fJgceg": "okay hello um yeah it's recording oh uh can you say something yeah okay now here yeah good yes yes yes so um you did you fix your problem with the internet thing yeah i don't know i didn't fix it but it came back so so it's good we don't know good enough for now but it was a bit sketchy it was down for like five ten minutes so i was freaking out yeah i was checking today the document because i wanted to i was really into writing and then so my idea was to put all the my idea was to do what you did basically to put all the links like there so it was good that you put them so with them all of them are there it's good [Music] i don't know like what kind of writing i will do i am doing um but one thing is um did we talk about this oh yeah we talked about this uh that i but yeah but last time i was in uh writing on the ether pad that i was writing about the best practices of best practices something like that and i had some examples i put i i also add the did you read it in the i add to the best practices document wait okay i add to the it's called to the best practices i guess i guess it goes to the best practices yeah i add today beware of copyright copyright i call it copyright yeah because that section i i added specifically because it's something that you have ideas i mean i can write also but i think you have clearer ideas yeah and actually and also it was good because then i checked as well today with with my subject of copyrights and then so then i was like sure okay so this is what the law says so yeah yeah it's very funny because at the end what it happens is so basically what it happens is that no like as long so you you have the right to use somebody's material if it's in parody but this is a parody is is is something you so you cannot use the straightforward material of somebody else has to be a parody but then let's say in youtube you can use it as long as it's not 100 normal no so you alter it the material and then anyway they will let you know the artist and you and at any point anyway the artist can claim the rights which normally might be on their side but it's still like on the european union law it says you can claim you can also exercise your right to your rights and you can say that you were using that as a parody and the funny thing is like the person who decides it was a parody or not is a judge and if you think like i think judges are their sense of humor so it's based on their sense of humor of a judge if if you are the right or if the right of the arts art is the right so i thought it was very funny at the end is the is based on the judge sense of humor i see yeah that's quite interesting because i think i briefly talked about this at some point i don't know if it was a public chat or behind the scenes or backstage but there is this collective who always works with a lawyer because like they have this you know uh collaborator a lawyer that they can ask for you know like like when plan they plan the the project or artwork because they do like activist kind of things so it's always on the gray zone and uh they plan it carefully with lawyer because they don't want to get into trouble i mean they get into trouble but they always have to be on the safe side yeah which i think is an interesting idea i mean we don't have uh you know maybe if we can have a find a budget to collaborate with the lawyer and see what's the but it was funny like i was reading yesterday like uh because still as well i started writing again a bit of uh i started writing on my thesis uh i have the time to write so to make of the project uh uh he had to graduate basically of my thesis for the school so then i started uh checking about again like the text of uh of martin of post dance in the post dance book you know what i mean the last part of wait i will just i don't know i was supposed to say something i feel always i have to fill the gap it's funny that you said like i i wrote something that i i was quite into like there's something about that thing i don't know if you if you have the time to read i just quickly went through yeah yeah so then i was like then this uh this thing of mine a gap it's something that this is in my head often this the gap you know like mind the gap i always have to think in london you know like you have these things in the metro yeah yeah behind the gap yeah it was so like i mean it works in so many different levels mind the gap or you die but also super well i mean in terms of design is one of the most beautiful exercises that i found like so um yeah so yeah so i was talking about like so you have movement research which is the book that i have for you like that we wrote this in buff i mean and then uh you have the post dance there was the previous book okay this is from this is from two thousand and is published in the mdt which is the university in stockholm of dance and this is from 2018 so um so then i would hear there's a chapter specific like the last part of the chapter is about is martin saying about post dance and advocacy on post dance there's a pdf about that already yeah i think i said when you both like i think i sent you the pdf of this one but the post dance that's available online is that part of that book or is it something else okay i mean i think i yeah i know i'm just asking you because uh i read read the you know the chapter about the post dance and advocacy from here yeah so this is composed balance okay so maybe it's part of that book yeah yeah the moon research is more than new one and it's i will say is it has a different structure this is this is the is when in a way he's you read the chapter now then in a way like he's more trying to propose the the term of post dance and then he goes why and so on so yeah but anyway in that chapter he mentioned about the uh advocacy and avocado as fruit and so then i found very interesting like i mean yeah i think this it's funny because some of the things for instance like that he says in post dance they're a bit complex in the way of the language that he uses in movement research or actually in the podcast in different ways he explained it way simple because i guess he's he's in a different place martin so he can yeah as everything in life it just moves no so what he says sometimes i catch him two times like what i think he's contradicting himself with it with things that he's saying in the podcast for instance from the post dance uh article anyway that that's to say that some that um i think that this idea of a thing is something that is in it comes from like like art in a way if or if you think like that a thing is something that is not yet i think it's a compromise basically i think it's a compromise between something that i don't understand i don't know what is yet i i know it's in my head but it just eludes my semantic eludes my language because i don't know how to name it so it loots the shape of my linguistic yet not the semiotic of the meaning because i know what is it it's something that eludes my language but know the meaning of what is okay you see what i mean i think is something i think is something that is something that i don't know or for whatever reason i decide to name a thing without instead of saying the book or instead of like mentioning it specifically i just compromise my speaking and then then i just mention it as a thing so it deludes my language for whatever reason might be because i want it or i don't know it might be different reasons so eludes the linguistic reason but yet it cannot dilute my my semiotics it goes to some it comes from a place in my brain i know it's a thing it's just not anything it's a thing and i think that and yes and that's in relation just to myself like me and what makes it more interesting is when i have to talk about the thing whatever thing is it with somebody else like with you it means again a compromise because it means that we both need to compromise and say like that thing you know like we both need to agree that is that thing but not the other thing and and so on and can become more abstract or something um but it's always a compromise in that sense and but in itself a thing is like the is like the painting in the bucket you know like before a a thing is something that is free and beautiful in itself so i think it doesn't a thing before i start thinking on the thing it doesn't have to deal with all my linguistics in spanish in english or other languages it doesn't have to deal with my semiotic in relation to my languages is just a thing in a void it's just something that is there it's like imagining this like it's this book and if i if i don't have to relate to the book it will be just a thing it will be free as a thing and it has no binary position because it's just a thing it has no performativity whatsoever it becomes performative or representative at the moment that i have to mention it to you and come into compromise it with somebody else i'm mentioning this thing so i take it from the void and it loses this freedom um and in that relation i think is um like art like or art whole i understand now or i would like to believe it is is something that is tries to escape as much as possible the form the book the thing but it passes and become a book sometimes it represents it plays in culture which is ecology which means money um and it yeah and it do what it needs to do in order to i don't know what it happens with art to stage i don't know what is it um yeah yeah um i don't know i will slightly shift the topic i mean it's it's uh related but i take a detour um i was watching minority report a few days ago okay um i love it yeah it's very nice yeah well i don't watch movies a lot so you know like uh like these days i have more time so i try to watch it before no it's first time and then cool the interesting point what was interesting was because they predicted who um he's gonna kill right like he's gonna shoot someone like he like the yeah yeah what was his name again tom cruise yeah yeah but uh anyways um what's the character's name i forgot but so he's gonna so he what he saw that crime scene and uh also saw that the the name of the the guy who's going to be shot right but that's the first time he saw it and then he looks for that person like what that name but anyways but then that name that uh tom cruise thought that the guy who killed or kidnapped his son that name just came abruptly from the prediction yeah and it came from nowhere in a way like if there's no prediction there is no way to know that name i mean and in the end it turned out that that that was not the guy who kidnapped the sun but but what i want to say is that name just came from somewhere like really arbitrary but it was not arbitrary because it was in that world it was these people who are supposed to have the truth to dream the truth yeah let's say that's the truth yeah yeah yeah yeah they dreamed the truth or something like that yeah and that name showed up in that yeah that dream yeah so so i was thinking what is it and what if it was it was not a name or it was like um well because it's a movie it has to be a name that people can understand but if it was like unpronounceable word or something that is you know completely um makes no sense then it still works in a way i mean for as a plot it still works uh as a movie probably doesn't work because people won't really get the point um but yeah like what if they dreamed about this word that is completely irrelevant in nonsense and then but then still tom cruise can you know look for that search for that person um and then that that is like the reason why like the reason why i'm saying is pretty obvious but this thing can be something that has completely um you know a name that is not sensible it doesn't make sense yeah yeah or like or like or like a cultural or pers perceivable true senses through our senses yeah sure or we can just say that it's an apple although it's not an apple but um yeah yeah i don't know like it's just like open thing i don't have anything to say anymore but i just thought that it's interesting how it you brought it up and i what i was thinking kind of overlapped but i think it's very do you want to say something else no i think it's like this that you're saying is very interesting in the sense of you know because this it seems like he's like if you if you go back to the example of the movie that's one of my i really like that movie um it is in relation to like those humans like those humanoids these weird twins who are super weirdos and they are like they have the same position of in the greek theater of the oracle oracle you know like they just speak the truth from time to time and then and and the reason but the interesting thing is like even so they are so mysterious there they are something that in the movie they shape it as that but it's beautiful in itself because so it just let's say it works more or less for the movie but it's in greek times or always like they this oracle thing is just something that is mysterious and it's just as we said mentioned before it just escapes the sensibles you know like we might need to put it as two twins because it helped to the representation for the movie of whatever but it's just something that escapes our comprehension it just goes beyond and and and it works like that it's like the same it's like they exist as in a black box you know like it's the same idea that we don't need we don't know i mean if you think in christianity like the world in general like we don't know who is god we don't know him but we know he's there we don't know to met him since always and and yet the world has been built western war based on that god exists black box idea the same idea it's an abstraction that we agree upon and we are okay with and what i think is so that's one thing that i wanted to say the other thing is that is that it's so i think that's just makes me a bit angry like this idea of like i think that's very western like this beautiful magnanimous like holy thing becomes is minimized to a tool because imagine this thing is so powerful and divine that we cannot understand with their senses yet they have to put it so into it becomes a tool that is being used in that uh society to tell them who is the next person who's gonna commit a crime if you really think about it is it's really it's really i mean it's really is the worst thing if you imagine these things are so beautiful and they're just diminished to okay now just you're telling the cop who is the next one who's gonna make the crime and stuff this is one thing that i found is is very uh neoliberal in the sense that just very abruptly says like okay god or this thing is the function of the western guy and it just it will help us to make the society runs better so this is one thing and but yeah what i was trying to mention is this idea of this is minimizing this abstraction into a tool and in which in itself is not bad because it's helping the the people the society like the world in the in the movie what i think is that i would be more in pro and i mentioned that in the application uh impact is that instead of the tool a tool is always uh one-sided like tool always has a mean you know like the tool is there to fulfill fulfill a a task um instead of tools you have uh technologies the technologies are open-ended now they are they are are more frameworks to things for things to happen there they don't have in in itself an objective um yet then you then then their tools are happenings are and tools you can relate also as techniques in dance also then and classical dance and and art also is based a lot in technique uh even while people nowadays in modern days they try to say no in a way is becoming i think more yes because it's just the techniques are no flat and are not let's say as cuisine impressionism they are not the isms they are not just counting one by two by three and four but it's just everything has an implosion so it's like now you [Music] it's not that you're not supposed to work with techniques but in a way you're supposed to know everything i mean that's the that's the neoliberal uh perspective i that's my my my idea whatever but maybe we are david what i was trying to say with with uh what i'm saying now is that this is a tool that was a tool like these people are a tool and i think a tool is not bad per se but uh i think will be more interesting to work in frameworks where you can use more or you can be more with technologies uh than with tools because in a way tools are related with knowledge and they are absolute in the sense a tool works doesn't works tool boxes and so on and so they're related to knowledge and instead of technology as related to [Music] how to say not knowledge but to [Music] you know technology is more related so yeah the tools are related to knowledge and technologies to competence a competence are not they don't deal with absolute knowledge a competency is so much is something there is more broad you are competent in doing things but you're not supposed to be a master in it right and there are different ones like the second one is more inviting to things for happening like the yeah the competence while the other one is more excluding if you don't know the tools you are exclude you you cannot participate of the group you need to be part of the like the tool is one-sided and it has an end a purpose in itself i have a question um what are the examples in our practice practices like let's say like like for example we use live lab to begin with or i mean we have computer and internet but let's say we have live lab is that a tool in a sense or is it that's a good question like is it live lab what what do you think is it live love a tool i think i mean the way i see it is like live lab is a tool itself you know it's a toolbox in itself but in the framework in the framework that i try to take as a take live lab as an element and therefore then it loses the the tool uh the tool uh idea that's how i see it i mean i'm trying to like when we're doing that and it's not easy because by let's say by the way how is being proposed in itself i think it's a toolbox like i just read something that uh olivia putin in a festival that she's participating in brussels it's called the oscillator festival is happening for the next weekend i'll see you in the link she will do something there i didn't know and anyway she was just mentioned that and the way she's described hydra as a tool for network something i mean like to basically a video conference something an alternative for performances so she sees as a tool like the way she proposes there is as a tool so i think it comes from being a tool but in the framework of what we're trying to do and i think that's what it makes it the practice it's just we try to basically unshape the thing and then just to to do things with it but i don't know how you see that this this is like um difficult like wording is always difficult for me like what is hydra it's not a language it's a javascript so technically it's she didn't invent a language it it is a library for javascript library but i usually write it's an environment because that's where you land and do something yeah so in a broader respectively also like when i work with hydra and let's say i have specific visuals but i will i would try to avoid saying that's an effect like you know you can add something to your camera feed on your body to morph into something but and i often first i try to write you know hydra to add this effect but it's not an effect because it's uh if you write an effect that's that separates what's happening in the camera and what's happening as a post-production but that's not what i mean because it's something more blended that you mean like you mean yeah sorry you mean you mean you mean the defect as a shader yeah i mean it is just like it is a shader and it is it can be thought as an effect but if you say it's an effect then it implies that you have this layer of um like abstraction layer of camera and then you have something on top of it and something you add on top of it there's an effect or special effects or whatever um shader or whatever but that's something that um separates from the camera or the body which i think it's not right also it separates the effect from the code itself because i think i don't understand i want to follow but i think i don't understand i i could lost like so then you see you you see in that the effect our effects are in a different category than what will be in the code and the camera if i say effect it's it's separate from code and camera and and the real space okay but you say it's let's say this is the visuals that visuals or code itself what is happening is actually the code then that is the code and it doesn't say that it you know it's not it's not emphasizing on the the the outcome yeah maybe that's that's the point it's not the outcome but it's the the process and code is the process and effect is just the very end of the process yeah maybe i mean the way because i think there is something interesting what you're saying is that i don't i might miss interpretation but what are you saying but i think if i mean understanding like effect and effects and different things you know i like effect effects yeah like the easy idea to like make a difference with effects you know as a post-production like something more as a shader and the effect that you can put an effect on anything you know the effect on like just the fact that's coming from the word in english the effect um it gives i think it's very interesting because it gives space to think of both separately um yeah and and although at the end you will have some effects you know you have some effects like post effects some you will do something with the codec and it becomes an effect and if an effects i will make a color like effects to make it easy for me um then what i think is interesting is that the effect that is causing in you doing and in what you are transmitting to me in the practice it might affect me in this this effect it causes me and it's an affection to me you see what i mean does that makes any sense what i'm saying um [Music] sorry i don't know what i wanted to say well i wanted to say that i don't like effects or effect but there is an effect that happens like what you receive is the the effect yeah what i receive is the effect yeah yeah but from my perspective or you know from the first person it's not just the end result as an effect but there is something that leads to the effect there is something that leads to the the effect that is the code that yeah yeah yeah there is one thing yeah okay yes but in a way you don't have to know the code that i'm right now no that's something that you have to deal more than and then yeah in that example because i have to deal with my own it's kind of similar to this idea of black box in a way it's part of a black box and then we go in like within folders you know because like for instance in a in a more global idea i don't need to know who what is the who is the what is happening in what you're doing for me to have the affection i will call it affection is literally the result of an effect so so i don't need to understand to being up for being affected i don't need to know what is your coding um so in that in that global sense and yeah from there and then if you want to go more in deep you can know partly of what you're doing but maybe you don't need to know the terminals of your computer you know you don't need to know how like you don't need to go so low level and so on and so on so it's still i think this is something that maybe we should consider that this idea of the black box is something that we deal with it but not only us it's like the world in general deals with this idea of black box as with god and just in general we otherwise we cannot live with that's the problem that we as humans have that we have conscious and the body you know that if we will be all the time consciously like oh my god but all this is working you know how is electricity passing right now and you cannot leave you know how my arm can move right now always passing this you cannot live so then you have to do this exercise constantly of negotiation of self-distantiation basically and trusting the slave all the master like in hegel's words like the mind and the body like it's a constant negotiation of like just trusting basically uh but at some point you need to go back to your cave and rethink things like for it's like otherwise we wouldn't be doing this one that is like although i trust that what you're doing is i don't need to know in in the practice is it still necessary for me to talk about it now right um going back a little bit um so we said about yeah we just received the effect but to be honest like i always find that especially in contemporary dance i enjoy taking workshops more than watching a performance performance i i see that as a the effect of their practice let's say and the workshop is the their process and yeah um i don't know how people think probably i'm not the only one well i mean it also depends on the situation i guess it depends on the p results yeah but if you if you mention it like that is because you should have your own opinion but i understand yeah go on uh well that's that's where it is but but that's something that also like the reason why i maybe i think emphasize on the code for example in my case because it's not that it should be taken as um something to something behind the scene but it could be something that i mean it has this you know potentiality or whatever you call that is that becomes something or that can affect other things effect is already there and you just receive it and of course there is potentiality that how you receive it is up to you or up to the view can you repeat what you what you just said because i think you lost me in the last part okay oh because um the code has the code can become different things it's not uh i don't know how i can explain it i think you did it good before but i couldn't follow before so because it has why does it have potentiality then because it hasn't been because it's nothing it's nothing yet no it's like a thing a code is a thing in that idea that is not yet something it might be something true it has potentiality you've become yeah yeah of becoming yeah but the image the effect visuals is already there i mean you can receive it as you like but it's already pixels that's rendered yeah there was something that i heard yesterday i don't know from where something that i was reading i'm really like i'm changing between different books like these days somewhere i found that it was very precise and very in that idea of that around the idea of potentiality of agency of these things which in a way is who i like to see art or like dance in itself then in a pure form then is it was not about like that if you do like if you are in a let's say um a rushful like a right process of artistic process or something like this i don't even know how to mention this like if you are doing an artistic process and you are in a good path let's say i don't know like have to be binary but then then what it happens is then instead of taking decisions or making decisions you generate possibilities and that's complete and that's a completely switch you see instead of like if you're painting instead of like deciding if i want to paint red or blue which is making a decision taking the decision then you're actually you're generating the possibility so is is so instead of like closing it's opening and it goes in the same idea of the technology and competence you know like like a toolbox will be closing it will be narrowing to blue and red but then the technology of the competence instead of will be blue and and red so it will just it will just open possibilities and i think that's something that is very interesting if you think in code uh which is something that is very abstract then yeah it's it's just something that it just in my head it resonates from what you said that instead of like taking a decision you just generate possibility or generate or generate maybe one can say that instead of making a decision you generate a decision and i think that's poetic because it doesn't like linguistically is not completely correct you generate or yeah i think it's correct like you generate a decision is it correct or more like options yeah no but then because then it still then it changes a bit the spectrum you see because then it's still like i mean the way i like to see it is like it still is a decision so you deal with the compromise and that's the way why i started conversation like i like the thing and this idea of compromising because if you don't compromise with things they stay flu they stay floating and then nothing happens which is okay but yet if you and what it means what you're compromised with things is that you need to slow down or be patient because normally you will be in relation with an external factor in this case you trying to understand my words but it will be me also just trying to understand my words and then choosing or and this this is an exercise is coming in my head when i'm writing like that this idea of the compromising um i think is more uh i think yeah maybe different words i think like accepting like accept like uh disagree agree to disagree is a really horrible passive aggression pacific passive aggressive attitude um because it's not compromising you just let it there for something that is not it's nothing will happen from it uh and it's not and i think in that exercise of dilate dialect dialectic exercise of searching for the truth so together with with you or somebody else is in that exercise then things might arise not because i might end up with the absolute truth but because we are actively searching for the truth and then we have to compromise in words so something that like i call a thing you call a different thing uh you might call a box then i think in order to to to create something that is more stable and actually resonates more in different people then it needs compromises otherwise it's passive aggressive i think [Music] um yeah i mean i don't really i don't really object that sounds uh um i wanna object object but but um no i was thinking about several things one thing i found really interesting i couldn't i just tried to search it but i couldn't find the exact word but uh uh like yesterday i learned that to to table or to table in or something like that to table up i don't know like this is this table as verb with i don't know what proposition but uh in the states it means that you postpone that topic you know you just let it aside so you know we can you know table in at this you know discussion and uh talk about something else but then and it's called i mean how you call it table i i have to search it um i wrote but then uh in british english it means that you use you set that as a topic so you talk about it actually you table something something like that yeah to talk about it so it's like completely opposite and it's completely confusing which i found is really really nice because i mean of course it depends on the top the the context you can understand what it means um but still like it has this double meaning completely opposite which i found is very nice that it kind of um denies the the the meeting itself and the other thing i was thinking is um yeah this this comic in japan um it's like really short one that a guy says i invented a new letter and the other guy asks you know what what is that letter and at the end this guy pronounces you know it's a comic so there's always this speech bubble and you say something and that's like this letter that they just invented but it it's so funny because because it's drawn on the you know it's printed so it it's the character is saying something but as a reader you cannot imagine what he's saying because it's just like completely uh random letter that doesn't exist and it just kind of yeah it you know it's not just giving the room to interpret but it plays with this um this limitation of the medium to make it make the agency basically i think that was very very cool like but is there a reaction from the other person no i think that's the that's the end it's like you know just like four um columns and uh that's it i think it's brilliant though because it really like it squeezes the medium no yeah and it was funny because i i didn't like actually read that um comic but it was in one of the exam or something like literature exam or something that they they so it's not really fun to read that but uh i think it's it's really i mean in a way is it really creative that this uh entrance exam uh these people chose that as a topic instead of uh proper literature yeah classic or it becomes classic literature at the end somehow yeah i see what i mean i don't know it's it's a bit um detour again but i think anyways we need detour to talk about these things you know yeah i think it's because i think i think it's good because i mean i don't uh this idea of the them the medium is the massage have you read that book no read that book like i think i think i told you that like it's it's just i think i show you that that i yeah and to go to the bookshelf and find the book and meanwhile i i don't know what to do i don't have a bookshelf so not sure what to do but it's also interesting i wish the like choosing the right word is always like this practice or this process of like not just instantly think about come up with the right word effect or code or whatever environment platform not just like picking up the word but if i can actually go to that bookshelf or even library of words and discover that word which might take some time or maybe library is not a good idea because you can search it in these days so that's actually hmm sorry you noticed my cat was it's good cat crazy this thing like the medium what is cool from this is that this is the they call it the media prophet of 1960s because it was greeting in 1960 and it just basically the guy just writes about and just plays with the medium and and just talks about the yeah it's just it's very it's very interesting because also visual yeah because it's from in a way like it's very graphic but i found this is this is i mean one of the most difficult exercises like while working with design that i can recognize is how you can create like ambivalent uh frameworks when we work with design like let me let me simplify like how you can in a way create an artistic framework when you work within design because design is problem solving and art is problem making so then is uh the nature is different so then basically how then you can still like give a space to create that frameworks while you're using graphic design you know or typography or whatever design practices that you want to do i think it's a very very complex exercise because you need to respond to a client which is the freedom that art doesn't deal with i'll just art doesn't deal with the client and it doesn't need to solve a problem doesn't need doesn't need to deal with these things so then taking that role in design and doing that with it when i sometimes you see that it happens in the sign i think are just like this is wonderful because it's very very very rare and one is still with my argue and i read that also somewhere yesterday that is never never uh absolute true or honest because at the end it will always just fulfill the role for the client or for the business like it that was something that i was reading about web design or something i don't know it was a book that i was reading about making like taking design decisions or something i don't remember like something about how to communicate your design decisions with your stakeholders basically to win their trust and things like that because basically they deal with abstractions of because it's creativity as we do but they constantly have a boss in top that they need to sell their ideas designers i need so this book was about it and then since i'm working on this abstraction for my final work then i need to like learn how to simplify these things to just uh pass the mini mobile product they call in design like this is the minimum thing for them to understand and like it a part of all my gibberish about art that might not be necessary for them to know but anyway so in that book they were saying that it was about like this and these and at some point the guy was saying that somebody who works with art and design he said like at the end even though when you create is really wonderful and it takes a lot of time frameworks that you take carefully time to make together the thing between art and design at the end it will or be for it will be for a client or not or will be just art you know if his art is free and doesn't have to respond to things but if he's for a client it's just i end it i mean it declined must like it and that's it so and it's it's funny because i was just thinking about um the artwork i recently saw uh its online work and i don't know if it's relevant i hope it's relevant um it's it's like a website where i don't know there are like many icons and you click on it and it shows up another page as iframe and uh it shows like random uh writings that uh like like a list of names it's supposed to be like artist names but it's all like synthesized like not not based on the the real person but then there's also like random um comments from the interviews or curators or the you know they talk about the concepts of the art but it's all like generated by a machine and that's that's the artwork and it's just a bunch of this collection of these texts and if you click on another icon that shows another similar frame that says all these uh um synthesized text and that's i mean i think it's well made uh i know the artist they are teaching at our school so i know them well and but then of course i like to look at how it's made or what's what's inside because it's not really clearly obvious that it's um generating in real time or is it even like synthesized or it's like based on the real um writing or artists so i looked of course it's a web uh work so of course i show uh open the console and the the inspector on the web like the developer options and there are like a bunch of errors coming out because i think something was wrong and that's like constantly like every frame it's generating errors and it's already like ten thousands of errors in there and um then also like i looked okay it's actually iframe like it's not obvious like but uh it's just iframe that's uh loading from uh separate page whatever dot html it's quite um how do i say it's really handmade it's not like uh full of javascript i mean they use javascript for some animations and like text has some animations that respond to the javascript but actually these texts are stored in a json file that actually points to their github and uh what else uh so it's not like the machine is not making it in real time but all these texts not the stores so their database did the json is at least stored on their site or it's on it's on github and but i think there is their github or is somebody's else also it's their github it's their repository that they they prepared for this project uh it has like a bunch of json files for the project and uh yeah i just started looking into it and then then i wrote to them you know like i i found it's really nice that it's really handmade and uh they told uh they were complaining that you know um i don't know how much i can say it in this public chat but yeah like basically bullshitting about the the organizers or the curators in the museum and uh you know they somehow had to do it uh first with the help of uh like real uh web developers but they it up so the artists themselves have to code it by themselves and they didn't know how to do it and they just i mean yes but not that much they have been doing you know like these things quite a lot but they're not developers they're artists they're not developers okay yeah i understand yeah yeah and that that was so interesting to hear but it's still like you know it's it's an art piece it's not like uh but they're still like you know commissioned so it has this similar to client-based work a client work that they have to deliver something to the museum and even though they are and they you know don't help you they they are just i mean artists can propose what they want to do but in the end they have to put something together to show it on the museum yeah website and that's yeah of course it's different from design but it's still there is i don't know what's the right word it's not a hierarchy but it's there is this relation to other end entity and there's always this tension and that's yeah what i found really really um i i shouldn't say funny but it is funny to be honest but it's but i think it's interesting because that i mean i think i have one two things to say like i think one is that i think that that um work flow it's something that you you i will call that's um what um faking that comes from this idea i'm faking in art i think at some point like early like one year ago i was sharing this if you're faking is this idea of like martin was super into doing this faking of like fake healing or faking that is like you are doing something the best that you can in something that i cannot so i will start reading russian for you in this book and then i just make a performance out of it and then i do my best for real to just try to do it but because i cannot it just becomes something dense in itself so in that i make the relation with the work of the of the artists because they're not developers yet they have some minimal competence that's going back to this idea of competence they still need to be beginners if they have no absolute clue i think we will not we could not consider in this idea of faking because you need to be competent at least and then go on and they will have no idea sorry to present in a certain way i don't understand if you're reading russian in whatever you know way but you still have to be competent enough to present it or if you put a network a net net art somewhere you have to be competent to show it as a net art i think i think i think what i'm saying with the competence is like because i think i was more narrow in the sense of if if my example is i want to this book is in russian and i want to do a performance about it then it means i need to have some notion at least of how to breed some of the bowels because it's not the normal avocado so i need to be i need to have at least a mean on the mount competent because otherwise it will be not faking there will be something else but not the faking okay i think to be considered as faking then you need to have a minimum of competence that allows you to for the things to unfold in certain way that you cannot foresee because you don't master the thing if i would master the thing i can control it i would try to that's what we do normally in the world so that was one thing and the other one was the faking and the older one what was it oh yeah then this that i think is that is interesting because so like yeah then what the artisan that example that you you you provide were so they were working with a deadline and all those so that and then they're working with this they're working for the museum so it's like art work working for the culture yeah that's coming back to the idea of ecology because this is the art that is just just trying to like is something that doesn't have shape and they don't know how to deal with it but they're working on it and they have to force themselves to to perform basically their armpits into the culture because the culture is and they are the institution is then the museum needs that they're forcing them to you need to do this in certain way because otherwise you cannot be here you cannot be paid and so on it has very efficient it has to be for the culture i think it has to be i don't know if efficient i think one could say it is now liberal so i will say yes yeah it has to be efficient enough let's say because still we're talking about culture yeah so it has to be the same as i remember martin was saying in the podcast what martin was saying about that in the podcast like i think that that leads to the question of efficiency if you um talk about culture yeah yeah so you can art to mix up with culture then art cannot be efficient no no because then it's then it's performing and art doesn't have to perform you know like and like i mean then it it comes again to the idea of performativity or representation like in the pure sense i think art doesn't have to do anything more than just not be i think art in a pure sense is what i was trying to write or like in my my my ideas like art is a thing that is not yet there is not that i'm not even calling in that example of my right leg and the way how i started conversation is i said like the thing is something that is there is like the book that i'm not yet know that i will take it's just a thing it has no and it's so beautiful in itself because there is nothing binary in in the in the thing it's just a thing but then at the moment that i start doing my wishes desires and so on and putting in different frameworks culture no liberalism identities like so on it just it just becomes a mess which is art and and it's this art um but then i think and i think that example we do a good work uh in the same with the with the practices because then we are conscious that we are we're using tools like i mean we do we use tools but we try to not stay with the tools like there is there you i mean we do constantly this exercise from folding unfolding grouping and and grouping like like we question constantly not yet not rational as possible what we do in the doing not the exercise that we are doing now that is different this is just pure some this is just basically you and me trying to talk through english that's a different thing this is not art i don't know i wouldn't say this is art but then i will say is not no this can be interpreted or it can be become something but this itself is not to make it i agree with you yeah because it can be art i guess if you take this that we are doing and we put it in with other things it can become art i think but yeah i agree with you in itself isn't it is not art in itself it's not the thing it's not just that thing because it's more we are just we are charged just with different things and going to the example of the artist in the museum so like art in relation to the uh institutions of co so art in relation to culture the color is no liberal and is is efficient art doesn't have to be efficient yet needs to eat you know like so then you need to perform and then you you adjust the art in order to just live like anybody else and i think this and that's a point where i'm i think more lately um i am from my uh understanding from my place of privilege that is like i'm questioning this like since i'm privileged in the place that i live and the way who i live that i can work and do things that i want and i'm just questioning that i mean because i have the time to actually think what i normally do is perform a way of do my art and a way to be this so what i'm saying is that i'm questioning my my doing in relation to culture uh understanding what you in in terms of like yeah learning how to write learning how to be in belgium how to be in germany how to write home how to i'm question and start to questioning this because i'm in space of privilege uh i will be in other place and i have no time to think of this thing and spend time and think in thinking of the thing and so on then then just you leave uh but because i have the time to think of the thing then then but then i started slowly questioning as well and i start and start understanding also my my relation towards my identities and my understanding also that i don't want to hijack things that was something that i learned partly in the exercise with you guys it's like although it was important for me to say something as well i i need to hijack something for me to express me and yet to just compromise going back to this idea of just yet compromised with the cause in that sense to provide an application together with you another person um but this is something that is getting more clear and more like one more question in this like it's me in this context i'm not from here uh and different like so it is getting given more signs of what does that mean you see that is very because it's always in relation to culture i think yeah um i think we should close around here but i just thought about something um something funny that like what it doesn't mean that i'm privileged and i'm not or how i would not be and just imagining like if i have to go back to japan and somehow i have no other job to do so i have to go to mcdonald's and make hamburgers all day but then what if i think that how my life is in germany is actually at mcdonald's that i produce a thing all day maybe that's i don't know if that analogy makes sense to you but is it again because i lost the last part so just just just thinking that you know if if i don't have time means that uh i have to work at mcdonald's all day to produce numbers but then if i think the the way how i'm living right now is actually at um mcdonald's that produce a thing all day and i'm just at the kitchen of mcdonald's to produce a thing i don't know it's just yeah but then yeah if i enter someone you said but uh but i don't understand it's like then what are you trying to say is then then then is it is it uh like a positive thing or as a negative thing or it can be either way i think but i mean that if you are working something if you're just making a thing in that case hamburgers is one thing and you're just so busy that you don't have time to think about the thing just you do your thing and then you're just making hamburgers right then i think you are living in one hand a simple life but at the same time i think it's good because you are in one because then you're just busy and you just do one thing i don't know and then but in the other hand yeah that that kind of you know it's it well i'm not saying this is becoming repetitive but it can fall into that you know problem that i will be stuck in the kitchen or other way of interpreting that analogy would be that it's not like we're you know sitting on the beach and think about the thing but we have to still live in the capitalistic world and produce a thing within that terrain i mean that's another thing that another interpretation i don't know it's just a random thing it's completely yeah because i mean this is an act of privilege that when they just the being on the beach and just like this that we do is an act of privilege and just like given the space of to think about the thing to think about the thing uh but yet totally i completely agree with you because then you need to have the time anyways let's close it here and uh this is too long this is too much time it has been for more than one hour time yes okay thank you thank you for watching", "Evw1PExrfPg": "a oh shoot we have to change the speaker okay [Music] by the way it's already recording as usual and i guess we start with the public chat or should we do you have something to talk like off the record uh i don't know we can just talk and we'll see what i think planning doesn't really work right except the time frame that's that's except what the time frame the diaphragm yeah well for the chat we keep it open but usually like um with practice we just set the time and we don't talk about what to do right yeah i am yes i was checking the wait today's 19th 19th yeah i was checking uh i started putting something in the the text of with that did you send me a link of danielle's text yeah of danielle thing i don't know and then uh is the first paragraph is is danielle's text no i i wrote everything but uh i mean the paragraph i mean the the one that indented is the is his proposal let's say and then i yeah some stuff but yeah yeah but i felt like you know it's it's been some time and i didn't really make any progress and i was like not sure so i just sent it to you so that we can continue yeah i like it i like it because i mean what i like from the was the the shape part like the shape and shape and yeah the form form and shape that was nice i mean that i just read and then i just put something because this i i didn't i didn't check because um this is something um i usually do or not to do that uh if if someone comments or if someone replies i'm sometimes so afraid and i just leave it there for some time without looking at it because i'm just so afraid you mean you mean the dog dog or you know like if i write to someone and if you know something important then they somehow reply to me for example and then i'm or something like really bureaucratic like yeah like if if i get you know some someone asking me for a document or something that i can expect i usually leave that unopened for some time well yeah not leave it for a week because you know that's how that's not how it works but at least for an hour or a day because i get so how to say um like it become really busy with that i see but anyways but thanks for that um i think i think i also wait for danielle like if he has any point or if he suggests to do something because he's the one he's asking um yeah yeah so but the idea is to like collect some thoughts around that subject and then the idea that they want to put it together in cultural hub somewhere or i think so why is the idea yeah i think i think that's the idea yeah i see it's usc um so we're starting with the backstage i don't know know about me this is also like i don't think i don't think it's this backstage i think that this can be we are not this is not a secret of nobody true yeah also like this is something i was um a bit like thinking like you know like how we how we wrote with um joanna was more like um how do you say like we kept it quite fluid which was nice but then uh daniel asked me well so yeah first he asked me if i can contribute something for the writing but then i it became really how did i say it just feels different it's just but it's different i mean the exercise is different i mean but in a way but how it works what you were saying yeah yeah just just about how we work because i was supposed to give him something but then like like what you know it's also about the practice that uh i'm i'm not really good at you know like finishing some writing and uh it's it's better if i just you know do something quick it's not perfect and then just send it to someone or you know start a discussion to happen because that's that's so much easier for me than um yeah finishing something by myself and that's why i left it in my google hooks for some time and then i felt so bad about it so i see i mean he also said you know there's no strict deadline but that's that's also not helpful for me because there's nothing i want to help you want really important yeah i think i think that's the opposite because then yeah that's not helpful there i see yeah so at least you know i just yeah through the hey what about this thing of like new new now what that was so funny like so then did it check today is it still not working the forum oh uh no it was working it's just like before because i checked with before of course to you know check what the criteria or that you know what the uh i have to fill and that time like everything was there like visible like in the form um but then when i revisited they changed it and it's just like your name and then if you agree to the the the privacy whatever you know data uh privacy stuff yeah and that's it and i was so confused um but if you press uh click on the option that you agree to you know disclose the data or whatever then they will show the rest of the the the questions and also they changed it so that uh it kind of branches like if you uh apply for the exhibition or if you have life for the conference or both then they give you different options so i was like i was confused and then um also like before i knew that i noticed that they forgot to add a biography to put the biography in which was really weird but they fixed it too but we we have already some writing about that so i just copy paste it from other applications but that was a bit weird and also like i felt like because exhibition it they say it's exhibition but they say also like this category for live streaming so i thought yeah we could also do it but then you have to put like diff like separate proposal for that yeah that's a conference and i was like okay no it's too much no and also because i mean for instance since there is no clarity and it seems to me that it literally economically wise there's no clarity so then since we are busy as well with other things and i think the easy format is because yeah basic format as you propose to the things that is that just we propose the chat inside of the conference and anyway we're gonna do uh a practice but uh we just we don't present the uh the the focus of the yeah application which is yeah this is i mean we could have done both you know because basically we're gonna do the practice right and then the chat because that's what we do but i think in a way like to be honest i think i feel there is less pressure in talking than in doing if i don't that's how i feel without thinking too much just right now yeah yeah i mean if if we do the practice to present then it's that's different like that's just different and also like you know yeah it's just it's i wouldn't say it's good or bad i mean i i enjoy it sometimes but it you know it just you you need to prepare i think like yeah no but also the thing is it's a different exercise because it's like i i take it very close to what if i'm performing or if i'm dancing in space because it just takes it's not it's not that it's not about lacking it or not so it's i think it's it's more because i like it very much so it just demands so much of my energy right then uh and then so if you put what as part of like the elements of of pressure in a way then if there is if you know there's people seeing or you know there are certain audience that are gonna see it so that puts something on top then if you think in the chat like that somebody's listening let's say to what we're speaking right now it wouldn't change so much things for me i mean i guess of course there is somebody else but i don't have to do the this uh this uh what is the word that we use this since that the like this uh self-distinction or like that like i don't have to do that exercise that i think i have to do in the practice because right now i'm just me with all my identities here with you in the practice i'm completely fluid with this thing and so in the chat i want suffering i mean although there is somebody and of course an external person will put some sort of pressure is wait and energy wise it's way easier for me to go with the chat of them with the practice yeah totally yeah that's that's what i feel like when i talk it's easy because i i talk and i can say the i can show presents with the talking but if i do the practice it's so hard because i think the problem with the practice is that how we do it is not that we just go to this performative state like from the beginning you know and people expect that but it happens at some point in the practice but it's not at some point it's a you know a slow thing and that having people understand that is really hard i think yeah and and actually i was thinking that because i was not of my reaction with with melting pot and maybe that could be something to say in the chat is like so because the last week i was working on the art direction of a project of uh marco torrice call it melting pot and then so the project indeed is trying to not propose uh representation in a way so in that in that sense is uh similar to this idea of dance to uh or post dance or dance 200 like trying to not deal with identities for with or uh like with the political state let's say on representation and then just more like dance as form um and but then of course if you put in the place then you put people uh they're different because uh by the base the project has different bodies you know like there's somebody from brazil who's coming like from brazil or somebody from hungary there's i mean different people and part of that they have different styles no hip-hop contemporary like gaga like that's part of the project because the idea that the audience they mix together they melt together that's the whole that's part of it's a big part of the project and but all of these politics they come around the project in the project itself you know like the project is very political like it's very political it's a recreational space it's not a performance itself a marco put it as a recreational space and a pedagogical space but not as a performance but so all these political aspects are around the project but once the people go inside once they go inside uh then this thing has to pass fluid you know it means that i cannot avoid if i will be dancing i can know the boy like charging the space with my colombianity my male side female whatever is that people want to relate to my body on the space people who are watching from outside i cannot avoid to do that but then it's up to the space and up to the choreographer how to deal with the space in a way that it becomes that is just their representation is just passing by it's never staying it's not hijacking hijacking the whole piece um so i'm saying that because you're mentioning that in in the practice what we do at some point we perform so it happens as well but it just passed by and in different moments so it's never staying like the political part the representation like all these agencies they pass by but they don't stay if they stay and let's charge the space then the ship the form the shape will i would say more deform i would like to speak more about the shape but i will see more like the form the form as form it in itself it gets charged with the representational things and and semiotics and meanings and so then the the freedom that the form has that is basically as a block that constantly like change you just start becoming like a square if there is too much representation identity politics uh that it becomes like a square like very square and people and from outside as well you can start reading what is happening and i think when that happens then there is no more uh activation in the in the public in the in the in in the person who is watching the the practice because in a ways like you got it what is happening so there is no demanding nothing you don't have to do an active uh appreciation of what is happening but it's more like okay i understand i like it or dislike it and i think that's a key in this i think what we're on this thing that we are talking in a way that is representation in dance in a way of how to not deal with representation or how to not get stuck in representation because in past you cannot be boy to represent you cannot devoid to deal with identity in these things we cannot do that but then it's more i think it's important then uh i forgot what what was it will come on about what but what what was i saying that i said it was important right before i don't know what was it i will see it in the recording i guess yeah sure what i'm saying yeah it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't matter yeah yeah i i don't know how to respond it's just i just found it interesting that um in the seminar that i was i was joining um an hour ago that was about identity and you know basically um the professor he made a piece back in 2002 um in baghdad in iraq um he recorded like young like normal people so that's when the war was happening back then um but then you know people never talk about who's living there so that's why like he put spotlight on the people like normal people and uh it's like homage to uh andy wahl's um screen tests but what is happening in the piece because i think i don't understand what you're saying um i just continue so uh yeah how do you know this uh screen tests by andy warhol a screen test it's it's like um i don't know like celebrities someone like just um watching at the camera or like yeah i think so yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so it's like that but um with people in baghdad like you know you know like just normal people um like not you know soldiers or whatever that's represented by the war but who's actually living there back in you know early 2000 when the iraq war was happening and you know that's that's like how he framed he pictured the the people and you know that identity that character people carries and then because he's revisiting his peace because um [Music] yeah this was like a controversy with uh moma when he was about to present two years ago had he had some issues with what it's called moma divest i can send you link later i i don't really i can't really tell the whole um background but sorry but but uh i just wanted to talk about his piece because um that really was about capturing the identity and not necessarily like you know related to what we were just talking about but it's just you know i was and we were watching this his piece um it it's like 30 minutes or like 40 minutes just people sitting in front of the camera um yeah that so but that was working with identity that is yes that is like the purpose is working with that energy i mean how about a conversation with somebody like i don't know if i want to mention this because maybe this cannot no we can't talk of this another moment uh yeah so we can just keep on talking about this um yeah yeah wait so then i i didn't understood the comment then somebody you said like somebody said i see potential in your thinking and writing why don't you try to find a larger larger frame for all the things you have put on paper lately it's a form question mark it's a form of world making thought different from game it is about new grammars of interactions or new online subjectivities etc that might help identify for steps so when i read it i got very confused but then i read it like a few like some time after and then i thought like i actually is i see that for me it's like it's all of that but maybe it's none and maybe it's more or less yeah i don't know because yeah i don't know what do you think yeah i mean so that's another um um lecturer who was teaching at the school i just wrote to her you know like because that's actually that was like when i when we started to talk about you know how to make our chat like somewhat how academic i mean not not making this academic form but like what's the possible ways to um yeah to discover and i wrote to her because she's really um i would say yeah like let's say like working in more academic context and when i got that comment i was really confused but i was also i mean i know her so i i expected that it's not gonna be you know like super um how do i say like i knew that she's gonna say something more broad and conceptual um yeah and i think what she was i don't know like how i take it is like i think we can start to find these building blocks i don't know how to say like i don't know i let me check yeah i mean this is just my this is connected with this conversation that i have with somebody like with one of the melting pots person nobody was in brazil and i have yeah a very like yeah make me think of something that i didn't thought before that maybe i will talk to you like before after in the backstage but what i think is really one to bring here is that yeah so one of the things that happens in path that people say as a joke as an inside joke is like in path everybody wants to have the reason because if let's say if you if you study philosophy like if you basically if you study if you have in this academic path like western path that it goes towards knowledge knowledge is binary in the sense like if i'm right you are not right and that's what philosophy always has been doing you know like it's always like then there's basically it's it's critique based on knowledge you know you say something i understand what you said i said yes but why you didn't thought on this and then it goes and that's dialectics which in a in a way is like the the search for the absolute true based on the dialogue but at the end the truth is it always will be one-sided cannot be two-sided like although you can agree if you are in search of that knowledge from that perspective which is western it cannot be absolute it is my it will be my absolute true but it cannot be absolute for you it cannot it is binary in the in the nature the absolute nature otherwise otherwise you become it becomes a doctrine if you accept it so then you are not a thinker it makes a difference if you're a thinker if you're a real thinker a philosopher or like somebody who searched for knowledge and academic or you have the truth or is either my through we can search for the absolute truth together but one of both must be right we both cannot be right and that's very western very clear and that's coming from philosophy so this is one like an inside joke that impacts people says often is like in path people want to be right because it's because from that point of view people know so much and then just you have very nice conversations in different aspects and then there's this ongoing spirit of like i know i know i know i know i know i want to know i want to read like when when i was there i remember when somebody shared this book about be my body for me and then the person was saying there are so many books because the guy was pointing to other places and i remember that i thought i remember that i said to him because they were he was saying we were in a group a breeding group with other people and then he was saying like arena was saying there's so many books to read and then other people basically were agreeing like yeah there's so much there's so little time and there's so much to know and then i was saying like maybe not and i remember that just when i came back like maybe some weeks ago i was already here so not too long ago and at some point because i started getting really into that adriana was the one who opened that gate and then i went crazy like reading and buying books i have like seven books since that moment i bought them all and i'm really into that because open a gate and things in my head from the past so and then at some point i was having did i was really tired at night and working for melting pot and things and then i thought ah i just received a book of derrida which was the teacher of malabu uh catherine malibu and then then i was willing to like reading a little bit but then i thought like my body was just leaving me you know i like i was tired and then i just thought at that moment uh there's so much i would like to know and that moment when i thought of that i really put me back in my body not in my mind in my body i was back in time and back in time to the moment that i said that to adriano because in a way i i said that to him when he answered when he says back in time in buff there's so much to read in a way who i answer i think it came just as a critique for he answered in a way from my understanding of what i saw as a western person searching for knowledge and my critique in saying like maybe not it was kind of more coming from this multi-diverse uh universe that it comes more for indigenous perspectives and things that that it come more in that direction from my my ancestry and things that i don't know yet so much yet they are within me um but once i was in brussels and that moment it happened then i have to recognize me in that moment like me as the white person me as the presser mia suppressing me and so on so what i'm saying what i'm trying to say is here because i put it here as a question mark like do we want to have the absolute truth i put it here in my remarks and i was trying to to introduce the question do we want to have an absolute true and i mean i'm not expecting you to answer it's just like i'm putting this out like from giving that introduction that i said like and this is part of the conversation that i told you you have this brazilian guy it's like then it's by do we do do do i want to have truth am i searching for an absolute truth do i want to know what do i want to know like to be honest i want to know me but me there's so many knees and there's so many me's and what i think is beautiful is that in the practice many of these me's they become alive and that's something precious to me you see yeah i mean that question do you do we or do i want to know absolute truth that's like um yeah just aligns with basically what you said like it's something that i feel like people here are really obsessed about you know like it's so like to me it's surprising that people even ask that question because like what like what is it really like you know for me like that's just like sounds like just rubbish like what do you mean by truth for example um no but but i understand why you ask that question but still like i i don't know what what is this the striving force to you know get to that that question because like truth can be many things and you know like it's not like single thing you know um yeah uh but i think i'm trying to i don't know if you have anything to add to that because i want to like i had one thing i want to talk about um no no no i think i wanted just to introduce that yeah because to me like uh also like yomi uh the the the lecturer uh she wrote to me about you know how to write um like why did i say yeah because i think so going back to her point was i think because once i presented my work or what my projects uh in her seminar um it was about like communities and care and it's just like how i think is so i mean how i think it's different from everyone uh but also like the vocabulary we built ipos within myself that's really something special and i think it's it's good to describe those words we use for example like um this is this is really specific to her comment but for example i was when i was telling about the community thing i was working on for example that's how i met you and also you know like i i started to do like a lot of um meetups on jitsi or zoom then it started to become like more like a space than um like a video call like this is not like i don't see this as a like you know we did a call but it's it's more like where we come back this is the chat yeah every every day at the same time you know but maybe like something like that and that's that's like some how i see it but then that's not necessarily people would immediately relate and that's something that we have to perhaps be more yeah like just to just explain with more words so then so then in a way like baby try to to wait because actually i mean i partially agree with what you said but i don't see there is a difference in in this and relate relating to like um [Music] wait let me try it with a different thing no no wait i will put it like with that analogy because it's just that makes sense so like i think there is when say that black people brown people or people from other backgrounds who are not european then if you are in a european context and then you don't know what is happening let's say you don't know let's say you don't know what is happening yet you are privileged to because the space that you leave give you the conditions to think what is happening so because of that then not only in privileged places because this is just a phenomenon that is happening in the rest of the world like no like depressed in a way they're being more visible than before oppression has been existence always but there are movements like black lives matters and other movements that are just becoming more this this thing that has this asymmetries that exist in the world are now just visible more visible than before and then what it happens is that because it's just so complex there is let's say a lot of white folks who are trying to join the conversation you know with good spirit and just like say okay yes you know uh yeah just trying to join the conversation basically towards constructing something better than just oppression but um but if the people who are being marginalized is this is this exactly the same with feminism if people was being marginalized for so many years you have you carry the traumas in your blood and all these things and you don't know and there's so many different between like you know there's so many different ones uh yeah different yeah people so if these people who are being marginalized for centuries uh don't know what is happening and they don't know yet how to relate within each other because they they carry completely com really complex histories in their bodies they don't know how to relate to each other they don't know how to speak their same language they don't know how to use a colonized language that they're using how can they invite the white person to join the the conversation yeah yeah right so i'm saying that in analogy to i think since what we are talking is like we don't know what we are talking then at some what we did what we did at some point we are having this conversation since long ago we basically we just decided to to be fluid in what we do because we just don't know what is it so uh and then and then just on time we start finding your words at some point the elements as word appear and then this one and then this one but basically is i was mentioning because i see it as a similar process in the sense like if we if you and me cannot make sense it's very difficult to invite somebody else to join it because instead of like giving agency to the process he might just like destabilize the process uh i don't know um i mean what i'm saying is like yes but no or nobody yes like it's interesting to do this like academic process that basically we have to do i mean that we want to do uh in order to invite more people to join this spot in a way but at the same time then um we cannot forget that what you're doing is is still very fragile yeah and that's why for instance when we invite a third person like for instance we were really lucky in the way how this process went with joanna but could have been messy and just like just bring pain and sorrow and scars and things and so uh yeah just something to consider but i think we are i mean if i speak personally i think we are in a process there is mature enough like to but that i think that's that's to say that we need money to do this in a in a in a in the best possible way we because we need time because what we need is time to in a way like make sure that not all the that we as you said you mentioned as branches so that we kind of like analyze this is this this is this this is this and this is the practice that we don't makes the whole things because then if if we don't have the time then then it just becomes anything um so basically we need time yeah time and because it's uh extra f word that may make it's beyond how we do in this frame so that's that's already something that has to be compensated i don't know if that's the right word but you know um yeah by the way like uh for another application i mean that's the that's the new now thing uh we had to send uh images so i was looking at the one from node and uh like the chat like how we did like this but in the in the hubs because i think image wise it's really interesting uh yeah i like it very much that's true i was like you know struggling because there's so many moments that you are like expressing with gestures and i never do it i was like like okay i i just find like how i look is like really in this screenshot i mean whatever screenshot i think it's there's nothing that i'm like explaining like with the with the hands that you know looks like like uh you know i don't know steve jobs or whatever i don't know steve jobs does yes but it's true like when you speak i don't see your hands almost yeah yeah also our childs are different like yeah my shot is already i'm sitting are you sitting or you're standing i'm standing yeah normally when we talk you're standing always inside yeah no i'm sleeping i'm sitting here well yeah i know i mean like i think i think i think it's very cool like to have uh to to us or people who can give comments to what we do like i'm all about to have more visibility like not these days i'm all about to hear from people what they have to say um but what is also it's kind of clear for me it's like that the process is um that that we need to find time basically we need to find time if we have time basically so we need to find we need to find money because we need to find time and if we have time then we can work this in different like in in in set of things that might become more clear for other people yeah yeah i i think so and uh yeah but i think it's yeah if we want visibility or like if we want people to like not understand but you know like give more clues to get into what we are doing let's say then we need to work on like not we don't have to define words but we really have to be um how does it take yeah we just have to take time to explain every single thing we do otherwise people have no clue that but this i mean but i think they're too i think because i think there are two different things like one is like when we do the chat and in the chat we're trying to do this ontological process basically but then in the practice itself the practice i don't think i think the practice is as it is i don't know i'm not sorry i'm not saying about the practice but i'm saying like how we perceive practice in the chat but this is already because we it's easy for us because we are in the practice so we share something there but those elements every you know these small elements we have to also explain for example this word practice like i was really um interested i just accidentally like searched for something like that was not supposed to be searched you know like you have something in the clipboard like you copy something and if you if you thought you if you think you copied something but you didn't and you pasted and searched but that was the from the old text i copied and uh that just like showed something random and there was best practices in coding let's say like uh it was like our programming language it's for statistics and stuff and i just looked it because it it was just caught my eyes because it says practice practices in r so i was like okay what what's the best just show me this practice and uh like it has you know these headlines you know and uh they describe in detail but this one was really clear i can go back to it um to see what they said okay the first one which one um did i send you a link yeah and they are like so since then i just searched for several best practices and okay the first one do you have this pad open i see you actually and the first thing is the best writing article our code and uh you know they have this uh like headings like keep track of who wrote your code and its intended purpose it's like really clear like you just have to you know leave comments on the in the code to make it clear or yeah be explicit about the requirements and dependencies of your code that's really clear so like this this was really clear but it's so concrete practice um then i searched for other things since the second one was eight best practices eight best practices in business management and this one was i feel this is the more like the best practices i expected you know first heading is engage workers engage workers like what does it mean reward effort be vulnerable stay committed seek clarity like this is so abstract well they they of course elaborate a little bit more in you know one or two paragraphs after that but it's just so i like this this is very i like this is very funny yeah this is very funny yeah i like this this is this rhythm and uh yeah like in this like r or like technical like programming language stuff they really give clear headlines like the head the heading itself like actually explains a lot and you don't even have to go to the paragraphs but this business management or is um i don't know best practices for instagram ads choose posts that capture attention you know like this doesn't tell anything about it write captions that inspire action get better with every ad like just like it's just like total um crap so this is this made me think like you know this word itself best practices itself is really hard you know like it's sometimes so concrete as you know like more like instruction then it's not like a practice but it's something like you can just instruct it to do and you can do it but then sometimes it's so abstract that you have to really master it it's not something you are told to do but you actually practice to to have this practice and it's it's so funny this spectrum of this word practice has because it's so um pragmatic on one hand but it's on the other hand it's about you know the mastery and it's it's something you cannot explain or it's sometimes it's just like total crap but um yeah like and this this also that's this already like you know uh as a starting point it's hard for people to understand if we say best practices what is it are we talking about this business management kind of best practices or like writing code and best practices or something else and i think we keep it actually kind of blurry right no because nobody uses best practices in contemporary dance yeah so in that sense our best practices in contemporary dance from the point of view of what is i actually then i will say than contemporary then then the contemporaries in that sense is not there but if i was if i was reading like best practices in dance then i will think that is about best practices in dance or in choreography that's what i mean the fact the fact that i'm the fact that in the in the title is best practicing contemporary dance the contemporary dance in a way is a way to say new dance or post dance or like the state of the art of dance which is very elitist and now i'm kind of having problems with this right now but that's more personal but in a way for me gives the sense of this is speaks about the best practices in dance 2.0 post dance of these kind of dances but what is the kind of practice is it something that for example like i i was actually thinking about like what if we write something like article like that that i just showed you but it's actually best practices contemporary dance is it something a kind of thing that we say use live lab and hydra something like that that's so complicated that you can use which has nothing to do with contemporary ass in a way um but then or do we have to say that uh you know keep engaged this is like so random that okay i you know you don't have to say it even um it's something that it's actually a practice that we have to do to get how to get engaged or whatever uh yeah let's say get keep be you know engaged with your partner or whatever that's so bad but i think yeah i think that's a nice idea i mean as long as i mean as long as we i think one hand we don't want to compromise ourselves that's one thing uh in the sense that we don't want to speak about the truth so then that that's to say like if you will take it serious then it's just not working like but then in a way it's like if it's just something that if the writing is just something that is agents in itself then it's aligned with the practice and then that's that that's um not compromising that's just something that it passed through the truth or the falls or both and then just and still we can say things that so we can say like use hydra you use live lab and and do as a as an exercise like writing uh from more perspective without compromising what do you mean that's how i think compromising is like without searching or assuming that we are speaking from the truth okay so like how to say like i mean how to say like this is that this is i think it's a it's an exercise that in buff they do very often the way how they cried is in a way it's like right from poetics like then it's just how to make from the text something that is poetic so then uh so then if it's just giving a space for interpretation yes it's like even a space for interpretation something that i see it's blurry enough yet clear for the people to read and give so instead of like bringing to yes or no so instead of compromising uh giving agency for the people to expand and then just do their own connections yeah yeah that's what i mean with not compromising with the truth okay okay yeah i think i think that's cool um the only thing i like when i thought about okay maybe it's fun to write an article like that like not too long but you know with some bullet points that says you know do this and then explain something like that the only thing is it's hard to um like you just said you know um not the giving the room to understand uh like up to the readers but still i will be really um i will be biased by what i write uh yeah but that's something that you i mean that i think sorry if i interrupt you but yeah in the sense like the practice in the is is this is the same ex if you if you watch this or for the one who watch this is exactly the same what i speak about melting pot on the melting pot is a political space when marco writes or like put it like this analogy with what we do like what we do this that we are doing this is political we cannot avoid being political we are being really polite because we are in a space you live in germany i live in brussels i learn to live here i learn in a way to behave um yes to make it short there but that's to say that if we are right in the practice it's fine because we i mean we don't stay there i mean it just passes by and it's fine as we said but about writing that's what i think it works the air exercise with johanna because my identity was there you know i did not hijack the thing but it passes through so i cannot avoid being biased if i will avoid being biased i will be wrong to myself and i will i will be grounded to myself in other sort of application or in other things that i perform every day in brussels but not in the practice that's the way how i see it yeah that's that's just totally um i agree the the inside the the intention my intention was not the writing itself is biased but i will be biased in the future practices because of the writing the writing will but you know that's something that's correct but that's cool because i mean that's that's all about the speculative design and then it's fine because but the space that we that we share is speculative and this is all about actually what the art is very nowadays is about speculative the world is super speculative these days uh more than ever since the corona so go forward i mean like you know if the future comes in the past coming in the future all these things in between they're all fine because they're speculative that it is fine then it's just you with you and then it's fine but i think i think it's an interesting like exercise like i really like the i really like that the business practices i think they're amazing yeah also there's ten best practices of highly effective teachers anyways i just wanted to read it because it was funny provides a very it is a very nice look provide frequent and timely feedback value parental familial involvement sidestep the comfort zone anyways um yeah like it's so interesting to us just to see how people think about practice and then okay then i think it's nice also if we write about this best practices it will be like because it's not the best practices but it's the best practices since at this point and it's um like just you know think about archiving and also like yeah just leaving artifacts i think it's a good way to you know just have a snapshot of what we think now and yeah a month later six months later a year later like we'll just you know visit and oh wow like that's what we were thinking back then like this is totally like nonsense it's the best practices and you know just keep doing this practice practicing you know also the practicing of leading the practices um yeah yeah i will you know find time to do it i mean we don't have to do it together i mean i think that's also the thing that we can think about we can do it individually or we can do it like together this this format is also can be fluid but then but then i think no i think it's a good exercise but i think that we should do it together in the sense of because then we i mean um wait what i'm trying to say is that one thing yeah so one thing is i think we should uh link uh to you to the youtube uh this list that you made in the past like this uh the practice list i think is interesting um i think it's i think it's interesting this like because then you're sharing information with people uh i don't know why that's why that's the way we answer you i i think i think i'm clear about this like why because it's it's clear reference it's nothing to do with what we do but it's it's a reference and that's also when you think about how people write to their readers or how people frame the best practices is something that we can uh learn which we don't have necessarily have to use but we can always refer to that that we are writing the best practices because because other people do this way or that way but we do it in other way but it's also always good to see what's best practices of writing best practices yes yes i see what i mean so then wait are we saying that and then yeah wait uh yeah so then in concrete about the the the writing then we can't write like but so you would like to write about the best practices in itself like just like the best practices i mean write something and then i just start writing there i don't know how you want you want to put something and then i if yeah just write something and yeah we can we can post a link to the youtube and people can write about their best practices that would be fun i have a i have a friend of mine well somebody who is a friend like facebook friend somebody who's always comes i don't know what is her practice actually but she's the person who sometimes comes you know we have this like i don't know like groups of like dancers in belgium or in brussels these groups and then that's the person who sometimes who is like hey people uh i just want to know what is what is uh i don't know who is living from dance you know or who is how what is your practices and these days and then people start just like putting super long messages super personal super short like there's so many different answers of people engaging in the group and then she's just from time and oh but always she takes the time to answer one to one super short like you know like say for instance at some point she was saying like hey i would like to know some people in brussels of dancers or something i don't know exactly what was it but then people put a lot of things about themselves you know like who are you what is your practice then and then some people will be more mystic you know like uh i don't know this is uh jam uh mertens and then i work with the shadows of the soul or something you know like something very abstract short and then then oh and then she will answer like yeah but what do you mean with that like she would not let them go with just that and it was up to the person to just drop it or just being very specific about it um yeah it just makes me think on that she was doing that she was uh and always she was taking the time and she got a lot of answers to be honest like for such a question like she got a lot of questions a lot of answers because even i remember i said something short and then i put my portfolio and then she wrote something and basically i i end up answering her as well like but i copy paste the first paragraph of my video but i still i answer her back and she she got this for many people you see yeah i like when someone really takes time to answer not just saying you know thank you or it's good or is it just generic copy and paste but it's something that replies to you that's something i always try to do as well but that really made me think of the podcast that um so you shared uh martin's podcast before and uh with me and also with joanna and joanna was saying something about the the other podcast that you know on soundcloud it just suggests the next one the next one yes um did you watch the other one yes i listened to a few episodes and i have to say that itself was not particularly interesting for me like it's about dance uh who's you know giving like dance training um giving workshops and but they take you know like one hour to talk about like why they started dancing and why they started to teach and you know what is you know what is dance for them like it's it goes really like from um like you know from birth to uh where they travel and how they end up uh as a dance training teacher and that i found it's really interesting that maybe the individual stories are not um something that you can learn from or maybe you can learn from something uh those episodes but also like she's giving this space to for people to share their experiences with such a long you know like one hour podcast it's quite long um well not not for podcasts but you know it's a long time to explain yourself right yeah or your background and your your philosophy whatever and that i found it's really cool idea that she made that space because that's where you know it's it's ground where things can happen or humanity potentiality or giving agency yeah and and that's what i found in the that facebook friend you said about because um they do this same thing basically that it's not just about it's not about this individual answers but it's about the space that they created that's yeah that's that's about i mean i have been searching a bit about the term but that's about ecology in a way like people will call it that's ecology because that deals with like art and culture are different things like culture refers to economy and capitalism like culture is a system with is culture must be effective right like art art in the pure sense art is is liberal art is forming itself and so on and so on like in its true native nature art it's just agency art is just potentiality and so on but culture is is uh one-sided always and it is it goes towards best practices actually like in the in the true nature like art it can be a best practice because it's just something that it is it's just potentiality in itself so and that's in in yeah this that you're mentioning is like what people will call now or in english they use this word ecology uh that's about ecology and it goes and it goes very in line to what uh speculative realism in in philosophy uh speaks about because it focuses in the object understood the object as something that is not me let's say in space safer isn't not necessarily to the object as my phone and other object but something anything there is no me so a speculative realism has to deal with a lot with what is not me and give agency to what is not mean whatever is that and then is speculative in that terrain so it proposes ecology in that sense you see and i was like also connecting this idea to for example like olivia made hydra and that's also like very different but similar thing that where people can visit and do something or share something but it's in a very very different uh way because she made let's say software i mean it's running on her server um and not necessarily she's facilitating i mean she does meetups once in a while but yeah like these different ideas because this particular example of hydra like like more than a year ago like when i started studying i had this conversation with one of the professors he said like if you want to do net art you should make a platform because that's where things happen and uh it's well my understanding is that when you make a platform it can live by itself you know that makes that its ecology and it just keeps running without without you being there without you producing things which is really cool and i think that's now i mean back then i understood why why it's really nice but also now i see especially because i was involved in like communities and stuff by the way i'm moving my hands but i just don't show it it does sound really obvious um now we can now we can hear that so the platform is there and then uh but platform i was at first i was thinking about more like a rigid you know let's say like software that runs on the on the server but when i work started working with communities you know it's also like how best practices started was that like that like we just started meeting on you know i just posted on facebook and we just started meeting every week and that itself is also an ecology so it's actually nothing new to us we are actually doing it already and how it's you know involved node as well so this may be something also we can you know um um spotlight uh a little bit and just share what how it's happening why we are doing because we always go to you know the best practice aspect but it's not about beat up aspect that we have initially um no anyways just just random thoughts but i think because it's nice that uh there are so many things that we can explain we can talk about and uh yeah but something that i think i would like to maybe i i because i um like communities and gatherings are not the same you know like communities in a way like in communities i would say like when we um how to say like try to explain myself simple um in a community it's like in a community in the true sense of the community like that the a person can be sacrificed for the good of the community like a community is a beautiful thing because it allows you to have identity like there's so many beautiful things that a community can provide for you but at the same time it comes from a price like corruption comes with a from community also and all these things because communities are stable communities can offer you material things because they are sustainable they maintain at the same time the same place like they can sustain you and give you aim like material things that can only a community over you but at the same time you lose part of your identity about not part of you individuality because you are part of the common as an individual you are par you agree with things upon they are otherwise she wouldn't be in the community rather a gathering is something that it just happens and dissolves like like a gathering is not is something that by the nature of a gathering it's unstable gatherings are unstable gatherings may offer you one night like it's a rave party a gathering it might happen because of friends they have the phone of a dj and they have speakers maybe a good projector maybe two months after they tried to do it nobody has nothing at the end maybe just a small speaker but still people come around so gatherers are unstable but in that sense like individuals are more uh have more agency of being because there are so many more that are very unstable in that sense are close to what is going back to the scores like what is dance or what is pure or liberal art in the sense of form or blob like communities are more rounded and are more stable like gatherings are more blobby and they just dissolve and come back and you don't know exactly you cannot trust them but that's part of the the beautiful thing of the thing and that's the bad thing also because you can if you need to trust then then i mean then it's not the place for you this is not the place that's not to say that one thing is better than the other one it's just like up to you what are you going for are you because you might need to be in a community for some reason personal reason but you might want it to be more just in gatherings and it's more uh yeah that depends of that's an individual choice so that's to say that i'm more i'm i'm more i think it's more close to the practice something there's more gatherings uh that doesn't mean that the time is cannot be the same but just like just the guy and just as much as possible yeah i don't know without making uh making more complicated just i think as much as possible yeah the yes yes yeah i mean i totally get your point but at the same time i think that there should be things in between gatherings and communities and that's i think that's something like partly i was trying to think about last year and um maybe i'm exhausted to to pursue on that anymore so i'm not like i'm not doing any community stuff but um but that's because because that's something people really try to you know separate and think about business community this is you know more like informal gathering whatever but like i still see that um i would say that the the let's say the choreographic coding online was more than a community because it was involving a subset of a community let's say um even though it was you know like just two of us or like maybe one or two guests there but it was because i was not targeting like specific person to join but it's more like talking to the mass but at the same time like i was thinking some thinking about like potentially doing something that is really fluid that yeah like it's not it's like a maybe a small community or big gathering or whatever that is through it and um but still not uh we can be individual in a way and yeah but this is the etymology i mean this is an etymology that this that we are speaking right right now this is like distraction this is a sophist of distraction that we're having basically because then is uh then it's just an etymology you know like what is the word that we find that defines not community and not gathering what is the what is the word that we and in a way i'm referring this to what your teacher was saying to you in like in order to build up uh concept or to think together then you need to make compromises you know like what is the word what is what we're doing it is either also what is like for it just as an example doesn't mean that we have to define this right now but this is just because it this it it just at this point for instance it means that we have to stop because i don't agree with you you don't agree with me so and then that's it and this is just an etymological thing like how are we defining this maybe we don't have to define it and this is going back to this and this is going back to the the truth like do we have to define that exactly my response would be that like just you said we don't have to define it we can leave it as a question and it's important that we leave it as a question because otherwise people will judge if it's let's say the gathering or a community like we write about you know we i always write that before the best practices we do this weekly meet up and that's how we met because that's so important for me but it may not be enough information for people because that looks like okay maybe they know each other already and then just started meeting at the same gathering um or they they think a different way but maybe like if we have enough words to explain in that proposal or article or whatever then maybe it's a good idea to just you know uh give some space to talk about how we met and it's not something that is categorizable in uh i think so i think something that might work we don't want to it's like this is coming back to joanna is like because basically what you're speaking and i agree with you you is like we don't want to compromise ourselves uh in that sense so and then in that context i think would be and that's part of the poetics how you write is then we can use words that are coming from other languages for instance symbols this is this is an etymological process so we might like like that's what i mean we don't have to be so serious all the time like because that might compromise us but then like for instance words coming from other languages they might just do a solution like for instance what we're doing is i don't know not reunion in spanish it's a spanish thing so it's just an example uh but this is and that was interesting from the joanna's approach because that flattens the attention of the semiotic the the charge of the of the world um yeah with you so one way could be like we can use you can use symbols from other cultures you know uh like you want to use symbols from from japanese or it doesn't have to be your letters uh i mean this is a etymological uh concern when we don't want to be compromised basically yeah yeah yeah yeah i think that's that's really really nice i was i was thinking we should make a best practices encyclopedia but maybe it's more like a dictionary not not a dictionary anyways but no but that was interesting like johan at some point she was proposing to do that and i think that would be interesting you know like that like for instance if you check like i think in pub at least there should be three of those dictionaries like basically it's just art pieces that people cried for one of those is jan itself i will give you some of those because have it with me here one of those is like jan's work for 15 years he worked together with different people one of those martin savile jonathan borrows and other people and and basically the theater piece at the end becomes a book that is called agora and agora i think at some point i really want i remember you remember we have a chat yes and it was practiced that comes from jan agora's book and that was his work for more than 15 years which was basically a dictionary uh yes yeah and i think that makes sense for us like to start writing maybe maybe it could be something like that we kind of start just writing a dictionary you know like what is this word and then just things will come up yeah and i think it's nice if it's keep changing yeah yeah yeah okay i don't know i think do you want to say something else no i think it's it's it's good i think we finish here and i think it's like enough we talk a lot because it's it's me sometimes you know like it's more than a week since we talked last time right we took a lot of different like different really interesting things like there's so many things that we spoke about yeah like very practical things yeah because well practical to conceptual because i think because you were working on a project and i was well not doing but you know maybe the same seminars or i mean we we had time between uh the last uh one and this chat so we of course we had some ideas coming up and it's good that we talk like this something we have to do is like find the time for i don't think this week because i need to i need to rest still yeah uh i feel my body should we switch to the backstage now oh yeah yeah sorry we still have here okay thank you for watching for watching", "8BnUR1Y6UTc": "because i have some allergy to the pollen in europe that is called uh i mean to pollen it's called high fever in english you know okay yeah but i didn't have that in south america or an american so yeah i guess it depends on the the species yeah so yeah yeah some people say that you know i mean if you move somewhere else then they don't have any issues so it can happen the other way around right so it seems i'm allergic to europe i don't know what that means well i don't know why i'm laughing but your situation is worse because apparently you're allergic to japan also yeah i think i mean it was never really bad but well i mean the good news is that now we can uh openly wear a mask that's not yes okay i see your point interesting yeah how are you good good i guess uh well it's already recording but i guess we talk about what happened yesterday yeah yeah i feel way uh i mean i feel way better than yesterday when we talk at the end you know i was like feeling like almost emotional like oh my god thank you this has been such a long trip you know like if we were for four months like you know climb the everest and you bound with somebody like thank you for being there it feels so filled it feels so so uh relaxed i mean i have so much space now than yesterday um i don't know how well it's for you i don't know like it's like usually i see more like you know when you have this development and then we had the practice and chat but like yesterday was like this whole like one thing you know it's just like a huge thing and it just like like you said marathon like we were just like running the whole day maybe you can you can maybe uh for the people who are watching if you are uploading you can say what we did yesterday maybe yeah so the idea is to have like one day of streaming that's part of his uh thesis work i guess and project so we did like a rehearsal or like a test run of one day of streaming and we started at noon we actually met in the morning but that part was not that was not uh streamed and then uh although it's recorded it's never going to be published but it's recorded and um then we started from like with one hour of development that i don't know if we oh yeah you're just like fixing the streaming link yeah it took me like yeah yeah yeah what else yeah and myself set it up no yeah and we're setting up and then you printed stuff for the link and then we had one hour of lunch break from one to one to two and then from two we had one another hour of development which i don't remember what i did i was like stressed i think because i had some ideas that i wanted to do and uh one hour was not enough to work coding a lot i saw visual studio uh yeah glee glitch so at least these two editors yeah recording yeah and at the end i was trying this uh hot glue which didn't really work i didn't to be honest to check that can you send me the link in the in this facebook chat now to check it yeah i think i didn't check and i was busy with something so i i think can you maybe reframe again what is that so basically it's an analogy of like hot glue on the well a scrap scrapbook on the web so basically you can um take website or youtube videos or images and place it on your hot glue page so it's like you know like composition of different elements and of course you can write something there as text but it's more about like you know collecting things from the internet and i was thinking about using it so that we have like different youtube videos that we have or different data um assembled on hot glue but i think i need to actually code it by myself because um i need to use javascript i want to use javascript for like live coding and stuff so that could be interesting like i'm interested the in the in the in that framework uh and somewhat more familiar to javascript the other languages so that's that's that's something that i in terms of like creatoral process uh i might like to check like to see what is that yeah because i think could be interesting yeah also yeah yo so yeah there's one but yet one thing that i agree with you like yesterday before you said like um i think it's a good idea like for the uh project for the school for that thesis then to put one website so create a website that has the side to side streaming yeah which i guess is just embedding the two uh thing right with an iframe or something like that um but then then a part of the i mean we can like think also maybe it could be interesting to [Music] do something more but i have to okay i maybe have to do the ideas to say from that one thing for sure is like we should put the website that it has the two streaming side to side symbol wise the other one is like perhaps we can try to think in terms of curatorial process and try to do something somewhat a bit more interesting but so that said the same time that's already another process so maybe i don't feel so comfortable that what we will present then it becomes something different yet we both are comfortable that what we do in a way is what we did yesterday uh so i don't know what you what do you think about it um like this curatorial process thing i think it's going to be another project or the let's say that's the other project we're thinking about that i think we're not going to talk about in the chat yet but uh hopefully it's going to happen um but so like it's already in my list and it's also like something i've been doing these days is like related to that it's uh like archiving and creator process of the the videos and the material that we create or text and but let's go back to yesterday because i haven't finished the whole day uh so that was the hot glue thing was at the end of development two and then we had one hour of break which was really nice for me to go outside and have some pollen and we had two hours of practice from was like four to six or something yeah then we came back and then we keep the streaming open still yeah i stopped this for some time and then i noticed that oh we have to come back for the closing chat which we are really exhausted and i think we it was like one of the shortest chat like we only finished after like 15 minutes or something and now we're here so but and you're streaming i didn't check actually i checked part of your streaming but i didn't check it so you have just one long streaming including the chat or it's fragmentated no i i accidentally not accidentally i stopped on obs but i didn't stop on youtube so it was still alive i'm getting used to this yeah we are it's like you know like when you if you end the streaming on youtube that's like the end of you know the life of that knife yeah dreaming you cannot revive it anymore it's dead and it dies it fulfills its purpose going back to hegel then it's when it's free hegel says that then is uh only when the master dies it fulfill uh it becomes is uh free it's free itself no no wait when only when the slave which is analogy for the body only when the slave dies it's uh fully free see um but in case of live streaming you can swap the body or swap the brain because the cool thing is that you can stop your live streaming on your obs and if someone else has the same streaming key then you can uh continue the streaming from other computer oh really yeah i didn't know that works like yeah i guess make sense it works with a key yeah cool so that's something like like also like this live coding guys what they do is they open uh long live streaming for a few days and they distribute the key and they just schedule you know nauto is doing at three jorge is doing at 3 20 something like that so like i have a slot to to do something with that key and after that i just stopped my obs and you can just start start with your obs what happens i'm wondering what happens when two people try to use the same key yeah so the first one got it will do it and that's sometimes become a problem that someone like misunderstood the time and um like the the wrong time uh sometimes happens and especially because people from everywhere is joining some people are not like well you know confused with the time zone or just they don't speak english so they're confused with something um yeah but i think it's also fun part of it let's say you guys see what i mean yeah like the practice so that seems sounds like a lot of fun we should experiment more like with the metadata of the streaming it sounds like another element itself a beast yeah and i i think like also i don't know if we need like many subscribers but if if you have a good big channel maybe you can have like a unique url for the streaming so you don't have to generate it every time oh yeah i see what i mean but instead you can just make your own website and just put the iframe that also works like an uh like a recurrent key you mean it is not changing the url yeah yeah yeah anyways um so what did we do in the practice you were doing some hydra stuff that i remember oh i think what i did with the in the practice itself i think i started like opening bdmx and i never used it it wasn't like um [Music] like ah this is open um so i open bdmx uh i open live lab then i start i have the stacks of uh part of the martin's performance ongoing i think his podcast yeah i think if his martin's project was running uh for the first of may until the 31 of may so yesterday was the last podcast march yeah yeah on his new performance he was making one dance piece in berlin per day also and he's using that text from how okay and so i had that i had that uh and i was using the text partly the way how i approach the text actually i'm i feel very comfortable when using this any stream of not even text is just like symbolics uh or semiotic symbolics in what is happening in the in the performance in the practice uh then it naturally depends on what is happening it could be a chat with you a text then the text will start morphing into something that it sometimes change uh yeah often changed the meaning the the literally uh uh meaning of the of the word but at the same time i just let it open and sometimes it's just uh forming new words or things that both things and then i start moving uh from it try in a way like going into this process of uh [Music] self-dissociation with with the elements they are playing so that was happening yesterday um and at some point it was this very nice ah yeah do you remember that i tell you when i i i have this problem because of the chroma key when i use a webcam the color the green color is not strong enough so then i have to use the hue and then after i use the hue then i thought it was not working but actually was working yes then out that my feet was there and it was in a way not far away from my first body i would say like the body coming out of my webcam installing my laptop uh so it was in relation in a way it was not so abstract let's say my legs were bigger uh like well you see this the other camera was pointing on my legs from a slightly offset angle and i was generating a a nice uh nice forms nice uh grouping i will say like this process of grouping and grouping uh yeah and that was uh quite a lot of fun with that i think that was the way how i started you see yeah yeah that part like i was then i was like oh i should use my feet as well and then i tried to do like uh bring brought my computer to the the bathtub and try to put the green paint but it didn't really work well no but it was so long i i used because i used part of that uh at some point i went outside yeah and i was trying to put like so instead of using the chroma i used the luma i'm pointing out and and i was having my green shirt so actually i couldn't check but my idea was like i was using the luma so everything that was green it was doing a weird glitches we were just glitching within the frames and so my idea was like going out of a drink and then somehow like walk around with this green shirt and see that could be seen but i guess i was like this small so i didn't know i could i didn't check that part from the swimming yesterday uh but that was so when i came back you know actually you were already in the bathtub with your feet and i like it because somehow i was using my feet the beginning so one hour before and and that that was nice i like i was trying to do you know like green paint as a chroma which is kind of working but it's it's interesting how it you know blends with the like fluid you know it's like a it's real matter and i think this is something we well we talked about or like i've been especially like thinking about it's like how we relate to ourselves like during the practice like is like also like eating or um something like just using the mouse cursor and you know doing something is something that you can relate to yourself because it's not like like everyone does that like if you use computer you move the windows and you move the cursor so that's actually more interesting than having like controller that or like even the midi controller that you can do something more maybe if efficiently but it's more it has like distance from let's say the average user because they don't use them so it's something that that way in that way that way or that itself like you know they don't have access or something like that but if it's a mouse cursor then and it changes the color as you move the cursor for example that's like you know it's just instant you get it you know so that's something i start to think but also like like real matter like water for example it's something you can easily associate with something else and that's like what i'm trying to think about in the practice right not going to i mean it can be technical but it's not like something technical to hide something like try to make a huge program that does something efficiently with ai and you know just provide something super cool but instead we just do something dirty and uh but yet this viewer i mean i don't know if there's viewer but can you know you know they can associate with their experience yeah yeah i see now what do you okay now make sense like we definitely for this new project uh definitely we should like one of the these ideas i think would be nice is do some kind of like comment or like kind of like interpret what the other one is doing before you know like we talk one of these mornings like what for instance what if we do that now i understand what you are doing you know uh and now but what for instance if i if i'm just like watching i'm just like actually going in the process of kind of consciously trying to understand in one hand like you know uh technically what is happening yet in the other hand like uh more uh trying to allow poetics to happen and enter entering a in a best practice process with within that framework of uh understanding uh the material from without you telling me and see what happens and this is why i was really excited to uh so i just had a chat with danae and i don't know if you're watching but hello then i um sorry and suspected um but what she does is basically that like she like she's like let's say expert in like adaptation of dance so basically she watches like bunch of videos of of a piece plus interviews and like related like everything uh related videos what they refer to and then she annotates like let's say every single movement or any remarks and then start to link all these uh you know what they said in the interview to what was the action happened in the video and in the piece uh and so on so like basically what you said is you know what she does plus she's doing more to um yeah like to the more like archiving process archival process wow that sounds super interesting that's so super interesting uh that's because that's very specific yeah in terms of like because we if you talk of this like as i oh it might be interesting to do this of course like we we will approach it some somewhat differently but then so she has already a practice on it and so instead of starting from zero will be interesting to see how does she uh approach these processes um so yeah definitely uh maybe we can talk a little bit more in the in the backstage afterwards for sure yeah but um does so have you watched any of uh of these processes or this video uh archiving or one of her works yeah she just uh talked through one uh some of the things she did so she's like that part was like done with motion bank so basically with the peacemaker and the other thing that you know the grid thing that you can uh make a webpage uh and uh yeah i was just trying to look a little bit more i can send you a link as well yeah we can talk a little bit uh when we go to backstage yeah uh but it sounds super cool so i'm like i'm really like looking for like maybe do something with it um what else i was watching some videos i mean the streaming from yesterday um i don't know what i thought so that was a cool thing like with the feet it was fun and at the end again i was using the cursor to change a little bit of the feedback um yeah oh and the text uh well you said about the text already but i think it's really cool that um like well martin's uh work is also interesting but also like the thing that we're using the chat like i mean you you're using the chat like this kind of video in the practice uh already but uh last time like for me it was first time using it just the you know the transcribed i mean uh speech to text like generated text so so you use it on our chat on our chat i took i did i took the chat one of the chat and used that uh you know automated speech to text to get the subtitle or the caption and i used that data so i think i was showing it somewhere yes i wasn't sure from where it was coming from and i thought like those are interesting things like from time to time and so that was actually our chat that was a chat yeah it's so fun because yeah it's it's in a different form but sometimes i relate myself because that's basically we talked about either i or you said it and maybe it's you know wrongly uh interpreted but you know mostly it's quite accurate so that was fun yeah that's cool okay now i get it now i get it i i yeah because you see but that's what it happens like this is what gestalt principles uh this this is the brain how it works like because the last time at some point we started using in the in this practice the last practice that we have uh at some point i start upon love love and love and love and what is love for this song and all this thing and at some point then you use like a message that somebody told you and then you put it there about like hey i would love to i'm new in hyderabad i would love to something so i thought it might be a conversation with you and somebody else that was my interpretation of the text well it was kind of that someone was asking me i didn't reply though but you didn't use it i mean no no i mean i'm saying like that i'm saying that in what it happens yesterday is like i assumed that yeah but nice i mean i think it's cool because in a way like you see like there is some i don't want to use that board evolution because i have some yeah but there is some work and in that direction like the last time in a way like something is happening with the text specifically with love in this case um i guess we just defined yesterday that we will use text uh but then you start using the text and par uh the archiving coming from the text so that i think that's nice there is like upcycling upcycling uh parts of the archive actively yeah yeah i like that so it's not only uh yep because i think that i think it might be that's that's that's kind of like something that is clear for me is that if we are kind of videos just to put a massive archive it's partly what we do then they stayed i mean then just we archived them and in a way what we do is like as part of like a self-distribution uh you know like distribution of the self but daniel will speak about that uh as i mentioned some time ago i think he called it like distribution of the self or something like that through the network and stuff like that that's basically once you let the network performance on the way then just you assume it just goes uh but what i think is cool is that still like when you do that it's just one shape that it goes and basically just as i mentioned before distribution of that object um but if we use that object like to recycle part of it then the archive keeps on coming back so it's not only something like that is done and it's ready for in a capitalistic way you can see it as a uh distribution but it's just done and ready for use within uh the sales practice so it comes back so in that going back to this idea of ecology that in a way is more ecological i see and it's actually something i didn't think relate this but in martin's podcast i think it's very i mean he said you know like greek something i think uh like it's really western way of thinking that the clay becomes uh brick and it stays in a house for generations or something like that he said and that's really funny to me because um i think especially in japan because there's earthquake and uh you know i wouldn't really i mean there's also like historical um buildings but it's not something that we expect to stay forever i mean it won't and it's something more ephemeral and it's also i think it relates to buddhism that um you know there's like the cycle you know you die and somehow your body becomes something else i mean like literally because like it's matter wise you know it just becomes something else once you're dead so it actually transforms to something else it's not just the spirit but or the clay or whatever you know the brick becomes house but then the house will be destroyed by something and then it will just become something else right like i mean you can people imperfect will uh like like matter in the universe basically yeah yeah yeah that's i i like this idea i like this idea of like as matter in the universe basically because the matter is not disappearing from us exactly so you just i like this and this is the things i think i like is the analogy matter in the universe in the universe universe because what it happens with with matter is that in matter physics in our world is that it just changes the states constantly so it will come from a solid to a vapor to liquid and it just goes on on and on depending on the material itself it groups it ungroups uh constantly uh yeah yeah and it's a it's a constant process you you know you eat and you digest and um that's the cycle right and that's also like our like what we want i guess in the practice is that it's not just uh yeah like you said it's not just like distributing what we do but also that comes back or transformed and we consume it again uh but it's uh ecology or it's some kind of ecosystem i would say yeah yeah you use the word like before yeah the ecosystem yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah also i was using one of the um also the video from the past practice in the practice like the one that was scrolling from the top to the bottom that was uh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah actually yeah i have like okay this is actually a new topic that because i was thinking yesterday at some point i thought like in a way it's i like this process already because since we have this practice and we have more practice and more time and hopefully we can keep this frame where while we have something you mean this let's say like one day thing like yeah one day framework like because it gives a lot of space and time to work seriously on it then yes what i was trying to say is that i was thinking that actually from my side like when i use your feet as part of my chroma uh or my luma or whatever as part of my feet then i often i use very often like at more than 50 percent of the time when it's using your material i use your neutral image i use just you when you are in just you and the green key or you and some but i won't use your composition sometimes you know like at the end when we are dancing or when i feel that the thing is coming together in that state of like uh chaos in a way then i in purpose then i do it and i'm just like let it go in that flow but often i will just select you uh clean because then it gives me some control of then i can work it out uh and it's progressively instead of just putting it in the back and then it's just very difficult to keep on working on that because it's already very glitch so what i was thinking in that regards is uh but i was doing that yesterday is like what does this mean actually because i never really reflect about it but then i reflect like why do i select why i mean what is this why i'm doing this i mean the easy will be thing to say about it is like yeah because if i select you when you're clean i have time to glitch you well instead of when you are like more glitch then i don't have so much to put on this and that would be like the straightforward thing to say but i think it's more a reflection you know that was more a question like what does this mean why do i select your body clean i mean what what does that do with my desires of uh the elements you know uh why am i grouping you in this way and i think that's interesting you see yeah that's uh like completely like i i relate to what i do because basically i do the same um because like for practical reason i think it's because it's way easier to work with clean image especially when you have chroma so that yeah i can um how do i say in a way we become more uh equal that like especially like when i use your feed most likely i will use my feed with like similar like chroma or something that i can easily you know cut out background so we can be there in a like let's say equal or like you know same um how do i say level um like there's like no competition between these different feeds but as soon as i uh like i cannot use your feeds that has colors and you know already changing saturation and background then it's really hard because um why is it it's not something i'm used to i mean i can still do it but then of course once you change the color then you know i i need to adjust my program for example that's very practical reason yeah but also like i think that's also like uh you have the color and let's say i don't have the color then that's not you know equal and it's actually really interesting to think about because um i treated um like two of us on the same level that like okay i'm captured by the webcam and you're coming from live lab but still like we're in hydera as a buffer we're like we're the same and uh that's that's really it's really it's it's just nice you know that itself like there's no like anything practical or anything logical but i'm just having chroma or something and i'm in captured with a webcam and you're also how you also have the similar setup with a webcam um that that is that is cool like when i'm outside it's nice but then it's it's different or you if you're outside it's it's different i don't know why i think we talked briefly like yesterday but maybe i want to say two things because for me it seems to me that they are this is in a way an attempt to decolonize knowledge this is uh and so and so and in order in so towards non-binary thinking then i think that when we talk often then we go in uh sometimes a period is in a way i will like make some analogy with uh classes and objects you know like super classes and things like that in coding then you have objects and then sometimes you have a class a whole class and then for me sometimes it's like this is a whole class you know like uh when we start talking now about streaming for instance that's that's something that is just a thing in itself it's a class in itself what is that um when we talked yesterday briefly uh we talked about this idea why how how important and how refreshing is when we use natural elements when you go out uh these kind of things that's another class in itself you know um so then when we talk about this uh this idea of uh selection it's in a way because it seems to me like a privileging actually from a horizontal process because as you said this the setup is very flat uh the way you appear in live lab and i appear is very horizontal and flat um then how does that come uh that does happen how what is happening then that we privilege the clear you and i'm saying that because i'm not interested in the rational thinking so with the binary like because of this you know because of this is working because then you could have your answers i can have my answers and they will be rationable within a frame but then what i'm interested in is like what does that mean you know what why am i selecting you wha why am i feeling that's what i was mentioning that assumed it didn't happen before but yesterday at some point i thought like wow what does this mean actually what is this thing what is why is that why is that i need to select a pure you in a way you know a group of you that is more suitable i guess to my desires and intentions yeah i see um like i'm trying to i'm not trying to rationalize but i think one of the things that um that we agree yet um implicitly implicit implicitly that we use the green screen and we move in front of the green screen let's say and that's already like it's good that we also you know like we're not trying to take over you know like you can also not use green screen but then that is i mean it might be related to the care that we have green screen you have a green screen and you have somehow frame it in a way that um that works with the green screen and then in addition to that you can use your feet or i go to the bathtub or whatever but that's not you know like you don't close the the the primary webcam let's say that has a green screen that you can the other person can use and these little things that like we give you know each other like space and we can you know work together in that sense that's something that forms that um like why we use these let's say the clean video from each other and why it's good like i think that's those are the reasons to me but again as you said it's something not we can describe in a way because it's something we built through the practice in the past practices that we've been doing for a year and then that's something that we kind of ended up in a way for now at least right so that like i think that also reflects um the process yeah yeah it's very interesting like the because it refers to embodiment in a way if you really slow down at the moment it just refers to embodiment at that moment you know like what does that mean like like in my body what is happening in my body what am i grouping what am i relating to what i'm i'm wait i don't want to relate so you mentioned this idea of care that i think is is is appropriate but then i'm thinking that because in a way it means like because i because i care it means that i don't care about other ones right when you care it means that you are basically you are using your ability to discern and then choose basically select what you like which means that you know what you don't like i'm not sure but i i get your point but i don't i don't necessarily agree i mean especially in this case it's hard to think think like what is not being cared but i think it's very i mean but i think this is the the point maybe where actually we can have like big bang moments in terms of the practice because it's like we are getting into places where if you will agree with me then it's not i mean there is just something that we put and it's just good i mean or it's just it's not really interesting in the sense of like we both agree but if you in a way if we if we need to find a discursive in order to understand the other one uh then it's just interesting and then it's just the practice in terms of like what is happening conceptually can might not but it just seems to me that there is potential to go in a different territory in terms of um understanding yet i mean from uh not not necessarily aerocentric point of view but yet with a like brain focus like trying to understand the process in a way like trying to reflect upon what is happening [Music] i don't know i'm a bit lost but uh like when you said you care and they say not care about certain things i mean other things i would say if i think about it like for example i said you know we kind of give space to each other and that's that is in a way that i'm i'm not saying slowing down but i'm you know like uh ignore not ignoring um i'm trying to not do certain things that i could do like i can just you know focus on coding for more time for example and i might get more interesting visuals with that but i'm not necessarily interested anymore in the practice i think i was doing it in the first like when we started the practices i think i was more into like really like coding visual stuff with hydra i still do coding a lot but that's the focus is going out of the visual elements i think or more becoming more the you know the composition or choreographic um thinking about the space that we share on the it can be the metaphor or it can be really concrete as the the display and the text or whatever that's happening on my desktop that's what i'm caring more and it's not i'm not really caring about like what would be interesting to have as a feedback or what kind of colors i want that's something in a way i don't care anymore i was interested but now i think that's in a way that's really um how to say it's not self-centered i don't know it's not something that i have to do with you and i think that's the problem with the light coding that they i mean i don't want to make it like gender uh generalized but if you have let's say 30 minutes to do live coding then you're like fully in and you try to get something um as visual or sound or whatever you just have to code and it's really like one directional because let's say you're streaming or recording whatever you're just doing it on your own and there's no nothing coming from outside or there's no negotiation i mean there is negotiation with the computer but it's really really never equal the human computer that's really tough but when i work with you it's you know it's more about the dialogue and less about what i want to show yeah yeah the process is dialectic but in that sense it's maybe it's because i'm referring this is this is kind of like hegel thing in my head because this is like coming from dialectics basically and for me like because there is a lot in this text that goes a lot of in terms of like negation like when you assume something is because you negate something there is a negation that is intrinsical when you act when you relax when you decide to do something is because you're negating to do other ones uh but normally in your in the self let's say in the brain then you you decide like you you you have the intention to do something normally then you're thinking you i want to have a coffee it doesn't mean you're not thinking that i don't want to have an orange juice a coca-cola or a glass of wine you're not thinking that but you are doing that you are not you don't want to have a the other things and in that space of the negation it is worth the life in a way he said it is because it's like he's he will refer them to what is the master and the slave like the master is the one who can only choose one thing and because of that he's just losing his freedom because it's just self he just have one option but then the body which is like the one who is not thinking is like not consciously saying i don't want to have coca-cola wine and beer juice and it's in that ambiguity where life really appears as a as a from that point of view as a multiplicity of uh fully in a fully thing from using his words like basically is that the idea of freedom freedom relies on the negation of things when you think you are free because you choose to have the coffee is not true you are free actually uh you you are not free but your body is free when you are actually do it when it happens in the other process like the negation process from that perspective because it's just infinite yeah but i think it's really what is interesting in the practice is that because it's not a performance i can take coffee but i can all at the same time i can think that next time i would take coke and that really gives so much freedom because if it's a performance or something that i only have once to do something then i really have to decide and negate all the other options and but because i know that this practice will happen again somewhat soon so and that's also related to the failure i think that you know if i regret taking this option it's fine because we can just do it again next time i mean we can choose the other option next time yeah let's see but i think it's not clear this is what you're saying i think i don't understand really well but you what you the way you said how you see that that you can do it in the future and that makes me think actually what he said yesterday but like what was that memory yeah he said memory will relies on the future that was the there was the approach of psychoanalysis before they would start using another approach they don't remember but before second analysis based that for the children it was uh they were saying that the memory of the so the past memory in a way is based on the future or present or future i don't know yeah but try to say like uh say it again what you were saying in terms of that you're saying when you do the practice then you can think and and in future and thinking that yeah something i didn't even understood what you were saying so for example like i need to i don't know um um i don't know i can't really think about a good example like let's say i choose video feed from live lab or like just think about like what to do with hydra and let's say i only have five minutes so i have to like decide one thing you know like i can all just try everything because i don't have time so i just take some of your video and i just decide okay which function i'm going to use and just try it and then and then at that point and at this point that i we've been doing this for some time i i'm really chill that you know i don't think that okay i only have five minutes i have to make it super nice and i have to make a really good decision like there is no concern about that at all i just do whatever i want and okay maybe there like i have some options maybe i just choose the first one and uh if i end up with some failure it's it's fine because next time i can just choose the second one uh although the same situation would not happen so it's not likely that this will happen again but then at this point i can rely on the future that it's just going to happen again and that just makes it so much easier yeah wow this is okay this is this is it evokes many things um because then what you're saying basically is that because somehow because of the framework then you are not concerned oh there are two things i want to say in the talk maybe one is like in terms of shape and the other one is in terms of time and then it's like uh because of you're referring referring that because of the practice already then you think like i'm not concerned anymore of like i have five minutes i need to shape this into something that is somewhat interesting good uh and in the other hand is that because of that then you are free from the in a way like concern about the future because that's basically that's that's the time part of it but i mean what i'm trying to say because if we are thinking there is a that maybe there's the pressure if you are streaming or something when we have the performance that you in a way that is difficult to not negotiate with your desires and then not trying to just act in regards to reproduction and to shaping something that is good that you feel proud of it um um when you're performing you know for other people it's more difficult to do that process of like finding space uh to feel your body and actually just do what it feels good um so in that sense then you are more bound to time and actually that's coming from martin's text yesterday like then in that sense like you are more bound in time you know your time frame so you know that you have one hour you know somehow that you cannot escape from the from your ego partly and then you need to do something to shape that in a way um yet then in the in the practice then because somehow because it's not it's not a performance then this pressure of time becomes more and then using his words then he will be it will that time be consideration so you're free from time because the time doesn't start i mean he was saying the time start medium and end and the difference be duration is the durations on what even though it's part of the time duration will just uh do what it needs to do uh and it is not negotiating with the sh the forming shape that this the form itself and the oldest thing that i was mentioning before in terms of um doing something good and yeah shape basically form and shape um yeah so in somehow i guess what i'm what i'm trying to say with what you said is that because of the [Music] duration of the practice because of the time let's say because of the the framework because of the framework uh you mentioned that you are not uh thinking of the shaping and then just you do that you were con trusted it will just take the shape that it needs to take so you in a way you are more embodied within the code than you you are more than a comfortable and true yeah more a comfortable process then being in the on a performative state where you normally need to shave for other people let's say yeah i mean i don't fully uh i mean i only remember i mean i don't fully understand what martin was saying but it's not that how do i say the time is present it's it's true that let's say i only have five minutes i have to do something in five minutes i cannot there's no option that like i just think that this infinite time so i just keep going it's definitely five minutes is five minutes and we see the end and that forces me to to choose from one of the options and what i said was not like you you probably understood but i don't want to be mistaken that misunderstood that i don't have pressure i do have pressure i do have i am pressured to do something in the five minutes but at the same time i'm really calm because i know how to handle that pressure with just taking one choosing one option and that part is not pressuring me i'm pressured to do take that action to do something in five minutes just give whatever i have that i'm really doing it but there is no extra pressure or anxiety because of making because of failure basically i don't regret it sorry maybe to quote this is part of things that i'm just reading and i'm just putting out because kind of my brain is warm then is that this coming from like the uh the color the colonies uh the symmetry on part of these lectures this is for actually what what you describe is basically what it is holding space somehow like embodiment part like just be more comfortable with yourself and say like it's not that i don't feel pressure yet i can hold space for myself and then be truly to what i can do with it you see yeah so yeah that's like something i can handle that pressure of let's say five minutes but i cannot handle if it's a performance that only happens i mean it only happens once but it's let's say like okay this is some i don't know what to say like um i don't know it's it's something that i cannot fail but i have to choose something and do something that's that's not cool you know like at this point i would say like you know i wouldn't put myself into that kind of situation anymore because i it's not that i don't want to fail but i don't want to have the pressure not to fail because that's not healthy and that's not how it should be i mean what is fail that's another thing but you know um i mean there is no failure basically and that what makes practice interesting is because it's recurrent recurrent recurring um every week let's say so that we know that if we try our best and if something went wrong we can just try it differently next time or if it's good then we can just try again and see if it works again or not i'm thinking now that it might be somewhat it could be my it's my interpretation of things i was i'm thinking because of this conversation and it has to be that's why for me it's very important it's the new process like to i cannot i cannot deny my body and just do what i normally do in my life all the time like in terms of my performativity in brussels and in my work everywhere because this is very true this is very in with these things we hold space that i feel myself very comfortable with but the person that my identities and things so then i'm thinking that when we because i'm thinking of failure then i'm thinking that when we performing note that it was a catastrophe that it was like not good in terms of hormone shape let's say and it was not working then i'm thinking that maybe that moment was in a way crucial for the process because it might have what if happened for instance that let's say it didn't work as it happened but then we just instead of like hold i mean instead of like supporting each other and being just like what so joyful about it it was actually what happened is that we both were just laughing and it was just fun at the end you know and we just like when we were down and how was it and then you said to somebody we failed miserably instead of we failed miserably and that was true but so then we were sharing that in communion so what i'm thinking is like it might happen if maybe even in that moment for instance it will have go in the other spectrum where we both realized it was just a catastrophe and then we just we both feel really bad we might not be talking right now for could be i mean i think yeah i think it like you know it was not happened at the right moment that you know if it was too early then that could have happened that we just like you know okay that's the end but i think we had already enough time to like on the same you know page that this is okay um thank you james for inviting us it was so beautiful i think yeah i mean that's that's something also i wanted always well like these days i just like realized how much like node or john was uh nice to us that you know we just like it was not like they asked us to through something i mean yes but it's not that uh like we're very relaxed to like okay you do something i don't know what you do exactly like jam was very yeah if it was really like structured then that could have been a nightmare but you know given that i don't know how many people are watching we still have a stage design that we did it we constantly have a stage design yeah we designed the stage because with the ghost that it fell yeah i think it was nice like i wouldn't i'm not sure if i want to go back to mozilla hubs but i think that was really good like i don't know it just like added like different elements that we can always relate to refer to [Music] because i don't know if that didn't happen and if i start to work with the windows like move things around i don't know if i thought that as a stage design for example i mean we could have thought about it but it's different i don't know okay we can close the chat here hey we're going backstage thank you for watching and please subscribe and whatever", "XiXaxmTadUE": "hello everyone hello everyone welcome to the smoking room in puff from my side and auto where are you now i'm always in cologne i mean not always but i thought maybe you were in dusseldorf myself oh that was for the project but you don't stay there no i don't know i it's like uh like 30 minutes by train well it's actually more 40 minutes like one hour door-to-door so i just commute there and um the good thing about being a student here is that you get a free train ticket freeze like 100 free yeah i mean you pay the tuition but tuition is like 300 bucks per semester and that's for the study and they also give you the ticket in the whole germany or in just for regions in the in the region the state but okay but the state where i stay is really huge and there are like quite a lot of um cities i mean it's not small but uh how do i say it like it's like a metropolitan area yeah yeah like it does cologne they're like all right close to each other so it's really it really helps like if you have a study in berlin for example like i mean traveling within burning you know it's it's good you know you can take the subway and stuff but you cannot go to other city you can probably i didn't know that yeah i can go to what's that potsdam but you know like it's just in the same like same uh area it's not like right you travel for like one hour to another city yeah so something to think about i don't know if you want to study in germany for you people if you want your thing to go to uh germany is a good place studying no i didn't know like belgium trains are quite expensive yeah i see that they're not cheap i don't remember anyways even friends out there they're expensive also yeah always like i feel i never have good experience with the metro in paris no but the metropolis as well as it's just so complicated also i it's just so many lines underneath each other that it's just oh well over i think when i'm not one think about where i'm from in japan yeah i have i haven't been in in i don't know how it's in tokyo i think it's the most complicated yeah yeah but to be honest like when i'm with for instance if i'm in paris and i'm with somebody else these kind of things i'm just relying on the person next to me uh so i'm i'm passive aggressive in that sense because um it happens often that i will go there in summer to visit friend a friend of mine that has a son diana if the anna won they see it is that i highly doubt it because i don't know why she will look at this but hello there so then we go there and then i just like every time i'm it's hot and it's just i'm just my brain is not with me yeah i have to say like one time in paris i i think i had to like take the metal and then change to the the fast train to to go back to cologne and uh i was totally confused by the connection like there's like a few gates that right i was not sure how to how to go through and right i just like i didn't have time and i was yeah i was running because uh the train was leaving soon so like i had no choice but just to break into again because otherwise nothing passing back japanese in a hurry japanese you know and that was like quite recent i mean like two years ago or something maybe yeah anyways it's so funny these situations in in international flights i remember one time i stay in brazil long and i remember that day was the last day of my my staying of my of my tourism tourist time and i remember i arrived just in actually i arrived quite some time you know like maybe one hour and a half already inside and i thought it should be enough so then when i go to the line it was a huge line and then i was in that line for you know like you're seeing just the clock and oh my god and i know that the airport still is big then you have to get to the gate and at some point uh i know wait i did not cut the line but i saw that some people sometimes they were just passing by straight away and they were cutting the line and just getting and i was thinking oh my god i should have done that but now maybe it's too late you know this all this like inner talk what should i do i don't want to lose it because yeah i don't know anyway so speaking about time i think um yeah it's like go back to practice but like the last time was one hour right yeah the few times like i think like at least twice three times we did two hours two hours yeah at least three times the last three times were two hours yes and then we switched back to one hour like just like without development yeah that was really nice like uh because you're talking about time and it's a bit like that you know like uh not waiting in the queue but you know um you know the end is coming you know like and as soon as you start the practice you own like you know sticking you know two hours yeah faster it's yeah like two hours then you feel like you have all the time true one hour is like yeah so i have to spend maybe 20 minutes to fix this first and then you know 20 minutes to build up and that lasts 20 minutes for doing whatever or something like that and and also was funny because i thought like i didn't get your your uh you were not sharing your screen until just maybe the last 15 minutes i think and it was i mean also because since we didn't have the development time uh i basically i jump in like okay now what um and then one thing that i realized fast and i put in my notes for myself is that if i have one hour i cannot if i don't have well-defined my framework uh let's say in terms of like self-dissociation i cannot start that process [Music] including bdmx because it just takes time until i build up this because it's an interface and yeah with two hours i can do that process of like self-distinction of like okay now maybe i open vdmx maybe i put one layer uh hydra moving sound new but uh with one hour i thought like right away okay this is not gonna happen not bdmx for today um and that frees me space so give me more space um but yeah something that i did try because it was i wanted to try was i because i shared in path on the board so as i test the streaming before so i was doing that one hour in advance testing like setting the streaming automatically starting from some point and then generating this qr code then printed and then testing is that just gonna work with the for the people just to go scan and go right away today so i test that and i uh but i completely forgotten what what was i going to do well i mean it's good that the streaming worked which was just something yeah and actually i have to say that in that in that regard that my last two experience with the streaming which was this is the third time that i'm doing a streaming by myself and then this time i feel it was okay it was not a traumatic experience the last two were just too much for me you see but still i feel it was a lot of it's a lot of work like i felt like it's like it's just adding another thing but i it felt like already like doubling the the effort for doing the practice or maybe because i have so many things to you know set up like without streaming i have to like because also like i was not here uh like i was out and uh came back like 30 minutes before the practice and then okay first thing put the green screen because i forgot that right i always think about that and then what i set up the computer with some cables and then microphone and then uh what else um well that's pretty much it maybe yeah but i mean maybe if i can relate to that is that in my context in my framework um as well then i start because we are working out towards this uh i uh this framework on on my school of the final work of my thesis then already i put like okay since i don't get yet uh when i i'm simplifying what i'm trying to say i'm not adding more cameras i'm just adding like uh the webcam like a part of my laptop camera i have another one and that's it and for me that works because that's enough uh for the the time that i have to work on this uh so for me that simplifies already my my setup like okay i don't know what to do when i try to work with oes ninja and stuff yet so i'm not doing that yeah yeah like um i've been like trying so many things during the practice like that past practices like i tried the controller for the vr and also what else did i do um loading last time i tried didn't try because i was a bit uh afraid of adding more things and then i didn't try the the windows moving last time because it was a bit too much but i was quite happy with the the composition in the last practice it was somewhat simple let's say like compared to the previous ones but it was like somewhat i felt solid and also the footage i used was um i was i was really happy with like what i did with that i don't know if you watched it later but yeah i partly did i mean i jumped between the the points and then um what what one said that yeah i don't know sorry yeah i forgot about it yeah for the footage i was like i don't know like somehow i decided to record from a train um so that was the footage that i was filming just before the practice actually like on the way back from dusseldorf to cologne yeah and i just uh timed it so that i know when it ends like so i started from you know halfway of the practice and then it finishes at the end but i think i i finished that i quit a little bit early this time yeah i was a bit confused by the clock but anyways that's okay um yeah that was that was nice footage and uh it's it's it's good uh working with that now you know i remember because at some point we start with this like love and what is love and then what's so funny when you start reading this message of somebody like hey what what was the message you remember the message more or less i can check but uh yeah i i should i should read it actually because it was funny so that's it was so funny that was funny thing about doing a live stream right yeah yeah yeah yeah i think that was something unexpected and like i just didn't expect that someone will comment but then someone said okay hey i am new to hydra and would love if you can give a small intro of how to use p5.js with hydra i would love to have love and would love yeah yeah yeah that was very funny yeah yeah something that i wanted to add also was that now i feel comfortable with the music because like at some point then we start having this problem with the copyrights and then since so now i know that and now what i know is like if the music is pure then the algorithm somehow will recognize and then we will have problems with copyrights but then now i know so then i know if i somehow the sound it has noise or there is it's not so clear then it's fine and still we can use it for you and me to dance you see and that was that that's cool yeah yeah it was but i was really surprised because somehow the the sound from you was uh i was hearing it super loud but in the recording at uh in the streaming it was really um the volume was really low but still it detected some copyright stuff it was not blocked so it's okay but uh they say this you know copyright claim yeah because i mean from i think that i shared that with you from what i i know from the copyrights is that it even though is the material of somebody else you can use it uh but not pure it must has something on uh because i mean legally you can do a critique let's say when you use uh visual material of somebody you can use it but if you it's if you add some critique on it you cannot use purely and it's still anyway i think the people if in that case you can't have the whole material i think i i'm not sure about it but what i know is the person will be notified but if the person is not claiming their rights it's okay is different if we are trying to appropriate hundred percent the pure uh quality of the song just for the sake of it then then it will be blocked right away you know what like uh i mean in this chat uh i think we don't talk about we cannot talk about this much but we are trying to start a new collaboration but then i was thinking like if we have another chance of like writing a research grant we should find a lawyer and uh list them as a collaborator i i know i know i know the right person for that like my teacher of uh of uh copyrights is super nice and maybe he might be interested in in jumping and i mean as a consultant i like this image of like yeah but i think it's it's even more fun if if he's actually like a collaborator like even if he acts as a consultant just have uh him as like a really really like member instead of like somebody who is really somehow involved in the process not only suggesting from a legal point of view i mean it is like it is just suggestion probably but that because that becomes quite a significant role in the process you know like it's if if that's like the main um like interest for that project let's say like it's not that we like for example it's not the objective is not just because we don't want to uh we don't want youtube to you know um complain every time but like big as a bigger role like how do we incorporate these aspects of like let's say popular culture in our practice and then how do we do it properly then that's becomes uh the lawyers uh um role becomes a bit more uh you know yeah yeah i see and i know there's like a collective in berlin they do like some weird um public like they do like activism kind of uh artwork and before they like when they plan they always talk with the lawyer to see that if is not going to be illegal or at least it's in the great zone so maybe for if there is some lawyer we weird lawyer out there who is watching this we're looking for you yes just we're not hiring but just contact us [Laughter] oh my god uh yes and maybe actually for we can start like saying maybe not in concrete names but we can mention that we are starting trying new pros new processes with in the practice and we are looking forward to work with new collaborator and that's very exciting we're really looking forward the the new experience new experience yes yeah so uh is there anything else yeah talk about in the front yeah there was some i put some notes that they were like not too much but i put some notes uh is [Music] here and then text concept yeah stream one hour to consider the light that's mine synchronization of new display that's mine sitting on the image you'll think now it's mine practice straight uh dumb failure yeah um no this may be something personal but this one yes um i think failure fail clear i think uh would be interesting to start considering consciously uh the idea of failure when we do the practices like in terms of let's say if i have an idea in my head is say i want to use feedback in certain way which with some colors uh with some audio reactiveness and so my head in a way is clear although it's abstract and i know many things can happen in between so i think uh will be interesting to start considering the failure so rather instead of like trying to go me just really like oh my god it's not working it's not working what can i do actually with this not working you know like to actively trying to let them know working do what in to take more agency in the process i remember you're really frustrated uh maybe like half of the practice last time what was it this one in the one in the one hour yeah or it was something no there was something that it was it was not really frustrating it was more the hydra was not you know sometimes hydro how hydra was doing something weird basically what it happens is like i put my code and then i just run it all and then somehow the buffer was taking partly not all but it was taking partly what it was running before say it was some oscillation with some colors running on then i run my code that it has the init cam in its screen and it took the init cam [Music] no they need screen maybe i mean it just partly it seems that it was running both codes somehow mix it up yeah i i have to say that uh like if you open the editor it already has the example right and some of the examples do some weird stuff and i have been complaining about this because uh like you know like you can just select which buffer to show or you can have like all the buffers and you know a quarter of the screen that you have the grid and these things that you can change but some uh examples they choose like not the not the primary buffer but the second one or the third one and that's so annoying because if you start doing things then you don't you see something you don't see it yeah exactly or they change some parameters so it's it works like super slow right you have to change the parameter and then this was like so annoying to me although i mean i i think that it's kind of nice that it does something unexpected in a way which is i think yeah yeah good but then i was getting so frustrated because we use this information for practice and then i need something you know something i can rely on so these days i just use my own editor i created my version of hydra editor with the same uh locally or no it's it's online but it's something that i just uh basically the hydra is like there's editor and there's the let's say the engine that does um generate the visuals so i took that engine and just made it my own editor like it's super simple but i'm adding like different tools or also like chroma is already in there so i don't have to type it every time so i'm just like trying to optimize the to have a best practice for my uh practice um yeah but yeah like i remember that you were like really frustrated by that like sometimes you know it's not doing well uh they're not doing what i expect and then that just like like i was also like really um not pressured but uh like nervous or didn't feel comfortable at the the first like uh like 10 minutes of the practice because because it was shorter so i could imagine that something wrong can happen so i was just like you know just my body and just like you know just warm up a little bit because that i thought that helps and then that was really good because at the end when you were playing music i just uh went back to that practice and just like moving like that and uh kind of made a circle uh within my right which was really um i think it was like i started to feel that i can like this particularly not is it's not failure but just to play with this you know being stressed being nervous i can also like uh play with it if it was like purely like like let's say a performance with live coding then it's really hard because you have to be constantly coding but because we can move like i can go in and out in a way and that's really good yeah that i don't have to code and i can move but it's still part of practice which is really nice yeah yeah i think then i thought yeah so i wanted to say that um i also now that we talk about that problem uh because it basically was a bug and now that we talk is like okay if i will have if i will use render then i will see the grid and then i will understand from where it was coming from uh but now i know now i know that okay that that bug now i can i know so this is good that we don't talk about it and that's one thing and the other thing is like yet it's true that i mean the image was it was great but it was happening because basically there was some oscillation and there was some ramping in the color and so the visuals that i and there was some kaleidoscope also so it was doing something very nicely but i didn't understood the how was it and it so they they my control over the code was not there and it was just stressing me so what i did what i did at the end is like i just like i open a new window and so with hydra so there was a new example then i just run my code again and it worked yeah but then i lose them the nice visuals they were before because they were really nice uh yeah i see something that i think was cool also i don't know if you saw at some point just by chance i have this drawing of a of a a woman yeah a t-shirt and there was a face and because i was using the luma then just the face was uh everything was passing through but the face was not and then i started playing trying to move my body and trying to put the face on your face and do some some playing around that and that was nice yeah i i have to say i didn't notice that during the practice and then um like i was playing with the this metadata thing and that that's when i discovered that you're playing that because i was playing these uh different metadata with the videos from the live stream and uh then i think it's it's funny because if i look at that uh when you were playing with that that was the time i was really coding that i could really see in the like too just like when i show when i see two videos at the same time playing together synchronized then i can see that i was really coding and i was not really looking at what you're doing yeah yeah which is okay yeah else yeah uh yeah that was what it was cool it was cool wait what the was okay christmas the christmas was i it almost fell on me yeah did you sprinkle something yeah because there's all these trees on my head i guess all three falling apart maybe that's something we need for the next practice like have like a confetti or something uh prepared and just like do it at the end oh yeah and yeah i want to say one thing like at the at the end of the the practice um so this time like i was mostly using my mouse to you know uh change parameters so i could like you know when i'm moving i could also like move my mouse and um change the parameters uh on the on the visuals and what happened was oh yeah i was just like moving it a lot and then somehow uh the desktop uh settings like accidentally clicked like right click and then click something and then uh a new window showed up that was uh changed to this desktop background um oh yeah and then i i i was annoyed but then i moved it aside i didn't close it and i noticed that um i don't know if it's the same in i don't think uh mac os then well mac os they do this in the settings but uh in windows like part of the window is like actually transparent a little bit like it's like uh like um how do you say it's small class no uh like uh like a semi-transparent but it looks at it in the intersection with the other window or somewhere so you can see what's in what's behind of the oh yeah okay i see window but it's like blurred yeah yeah yeah so i i moved it like on the side but that transparent part is like covering my face so you can it was blurred a little bit yes yes i see what i mean yeah and then like i was like doing like really slow movements and then i was uh so i was moving the window with the mouse and using another hand to like push the window away but that's when i was doing the slow movements and i think you were also doing something similar what was it i don't know if it was like looking at my movements or something i didn't i don't recognize what you were doing because i guess you were because because i guess i don't know if just at the end you were sharing your screen so i don't recognize you doing that at the end okay no no because i think the what are you sharing your where are you sharing your your output at that moment so so that's that's what i wanted to say like the let's say the settings window was only in the live stream i was not sharing it in live love but you could see that i was moving slowly ah okay without making any sense because the window is not there in live lab i saw that you were doing something slow yeah and then i was doing something as low because i yeah i thought it yeah yeah i was doing something uh based on your movement yeah yeah that's what i that's what i meant so that was really funny and i noticed that during the practice that you were also moving slow and i thought it's it's nice i mean i don't have to explain you know what i'm doing during practice um right but now i say yeah i mean that was really that was really nice i think it's i think something that sometimes happened in practice that you do something together but without knowing the intention which is right yeah yeah nice moment well i think we will we should do this at some point we should do like a practice of like an ontological practice where we just try to do like between we try to just explain like oh yeah now i'm doing this because this is happening and then just blah blah blah blah blah blah blah yeah like the like the how do you say it uh like watching sports like uh live yeah it's like narrative it's not exactly something like that that would be that would be really a brain in between you trying to do something and the same time listening to what the other person is doing but you mean like actually during practice like yeah like we're thinking like yeah yeah like that's what i'm saying like an ontological practice one session of because we do this in development but because it's development so we don't have the pressure of like we are it's not the practice yet yeah like i was first imagining something that we just view the recorded one and just say what what what's happening while watching which could be also interesting i i i see but that could be interesting actually yeah but we can try to do that like i don't know when but we could try to just actually you know like you check your recording you put yourself in obs in a small window under and say like okay so now this is what it happens is that i'm just opening the dmx and i forgot that i cannot use the chroma so then i'm opening now a hydra but then i by mistake i didn't press shift ctrl enter by alt ct shift enter and that just refresh them and then go go over and over and over that's amazing um i i feel like also like we should do it like first like separately yes i think separately first yeah and then we also do it together so we have like uh three versions that you know what will be good actually what what one exercise that would make sense because this one that we are saying i think it will be interesting in terms of more personal i think could be nice but i think something that will have a shape already is like if i do that on your recording and you do that on my recording because you have to make sense of what is he doing here you see yeah and that could be interesting that could be interesting well like if we get the the research grant then we can do then we can do something like that i think yeah let's keep the idea for that i think because i think it's a good idea yeah because since we are working and then i think we can put it in terms of like the concept is since we are based i mean in a way that gives sense of the practice makes sense in terms of like in a way we keep on doing this nonsense and we find this language is there is during uh sharing time for more than one year so that in a way that we don't have to talk all the time to uh agreeing some things are happening um so as a research or or i would say even as a scientific research it fits in the in the frame of like hypotheses like um or something like you know like in somehow i should understand i mean or i will dare to say now since i know the tools that you're working somehow that what is happening right now where are you right now as a scientific approach like in terms of hypotheses i think that could work because then we can see completely wrong i have no clue what was happening yeah i think that makes sense and also i just thought like uh we should do the anniversary uh practice when is that i don't know like we have we have to find a date for that yeah but sometimes april right like if we go back to like uh the first meeting that we have started yeah maybe we can make an anniversary kind of like uh opening bite you know like a anniversary of the ccl online basically i mean we can do the anniversary of the ccl online yeah that makes sense i mean also the spirit of what we yeah yeah yeah that would be nice yeah that we can and we can invite maybe if daniel can't come will be nice or like some of these people that would be nice true sure that would be great like and kind of like really create a party you know like kind of like a reunion or like okay we are here there is still coffee yeah that sounds like a great idea yeah so when was it should be really i think should be in april something like that yeah huh i did something on the fourth but that was that seems different i don't know um maybe 11 no i am sure it was on the 11th of april wow that's not gonna be a good day for me hey we can because i have some time around that yeah because like i have this my the melting pot goes i go to the theater of the 12th so before i'm just crazy about it and between the 12 and 16 i'm in the theater doing the whole thing so then the week after so which is i think 17 or 18 that will be work that will work that week after yeah 17 18 is the weekend so maybe you can try that we'll see because then i might be too tired so i i don't want to compromise myself the week after the week and after will be good for me for sure but i'm finishing the 16 and i feel i need to bring equipment that i'm renting and stuff so i'd rather don't do that yeah i think that's too soon so like 24 25 something that would be good yeah yeah and we can think and we can just promote it and just share it with some people would be nice to see people there yeah i don't know how it's going to be like but we will be you and me and maybe we can put a ghost just to have the habit of have the hopes because what will be the practice without the ho the ghost and we talking of these serious things about other people what if that ghost was actually someone who's just listening for two hours what if yeah just like everyone like that we mentioned we referred to during the practice like this uh daniel like write uh article and also who else we mentioned i don't know um you know so many people people from like it's called [Laughter] people from eyes cool i mean very many beautiful people around the world we mentioned the nice thing is those things that those were these are the things that you don't control when there is what is the streaming right uh when there's a recording you at the end you decide okay we it up we don't upload it uh although it never happened and yeah yeah yeah but yeah i mean so far has never happened that we don't i mean because in the practices like we are like this is what it is this is this is it like so bear with it be with it it's okay you like it good you don't like it it's good also it's a practice exactly yeah so let's let's try to do it uh yeah maybe we can just like open the link to live lab i'm really excited because i'm following this workshop about lab lab in the 2nd of april i think like i'm feeling like super wow fine after using live love for one year somebody will teach me how actually it's supposed to be used yeah oh yeah it's so funny because like i was i was like watching some videos um no like just checking the list of the the videos on my youtube i think the first live stream i did was uh i think it was not actually on youtube but something on the google platform and like five years ago and that was like a chat with uh lisa and daniel oh yeah what was that about and we were just chatting and i think um because we had some ideas to do something together which never happened um but what was funny is daniel was talking about live lab he was asking me you know like do you know culture hub and i was like no i don't know who the is that um and then he was saying you know they're making something called live lab and it's like i don't know like he explained it's somehow which i didn't really understand and i think now if anyone um explains what live lab is probably i wouldn't understand but um yeah like i knew that live lab has been you know like they are developing it for like ages and they just like released it like to open like to make it public last year uh but it was there for some time um okay kind of like the same situation with peacemaker but it's never never republic but i think it says it says that you can contact them to have access to it yeah but that doesn't really mean that it's public yeah it's true like it's not it's not public but contact us and if we like your credentials you can have it exactly i mean probably they don't say no but it's you know that really creates a barrier but live live is nice because you can just try it because it's open now [Music] yeah i still don't understand what live lab is like i that's why i'm really curious about it and they're they're announcing that they will implement osc protocols which i'm very curious about and i guess median or super protocols i'm very curious about yeah let's see and maybe you can teach me how to use live lab maybe you're doing it completely wrong i don't know maybe maybe not supposed to be used like that maybe if they ask like somebody has experience with live lab i will just be nope what is that well i mean they i know that they're aware of what we've been doing so i mean at some point i think i think rafael is guy in berlin from the processing no community uh rafael the bald guy the french guy no the the thing is german the guy from berlin who you we we meet in the i think they are processing meeting meetups in berlin and they are not processing new jobs the creative code yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah he's actually french anyways ah he's french okay so he put he put at some point a list of like uh online things happening and uh he put us in the this list at some point yeah yeah yes yes yes yeah so yeah it's something well i don't know something is happening or something not happening but would be nice to collaborate with you i don't know if you can give me money to do to produce something or to practice something chanel chanel are we are reaching out to you let me think what do we need in terms of resources if it's not money hmm i mean i work with macbooks so apple could reach out if they want i won't be mad i mean [Laughter] we are all open always yeah uh yeah i think i think was paolo scovar the one who said at some point that we always stuck in business we're always stuck in business next to plata or plomo like which means like uh which means plato plomo means like money or glomo is like the metal of the bullet so he was saying like plata or plomo but next to that as well he was saying we always are talking business you see so we always talk in business also in the chat yeah well i mean it's i don't know i i thought it's part of business we are this is we are we it depends of what is business but we are in business we are in business and we are expanding we are expanding it seems nice like we are taking this new um adventure with the practice like since now we wanted to expand and try to do i mean it it came clear to me i expressed this idea to you that since we have this time in the residence that we have here in pat for the last four weeks there is so much uh evolution in the practice that we see how much it changes and how much spaces it opens up then it just seems natural that the only way to do to keep on doing some conscious work on it is getting money from it and then for that then we need to move on insert move out move out in certain directions to give a space to refine the space in our own lives to to work for it yeah and just add another perspective to the money um i always think or well i'm don't say that often but i always think that we should be paid not for the work but for the existence and i think best practice is a good way of frame well not framing but let's say an example because it's not like we well maybe we make some kind of outcome if we get the project grant or something but then the practice is you know ourselves so it's it's good that we are paid for ourselves and not for the work yeah yeah yeah yeah like how it comes i mean i hope people are not taking this in the wrong direction like they're just you pay me because i'm awesome [Laughter] but i i understand what you mean i completely agree with you because actually i mean that is the same thing you know you're awesome so you get money yeah but not awesome yeah but of course like if if there is the if we will be in a system that it doesn't require money then it's okay but if if the system that we are requires money then yes so we need to get paid for the existence yeah so i can go to the expensive japanese supermarket yes i'm looking forward to have some japanese food in dusseldorf yeah let's do it like it's yeah yeah we have to do it so whenever you can travel then yeah yes yes uh as well like the since these things of seed is happening as well like i'm sure uh or i hope you will come and visit at some point to see the installation and meet the crew meet peter meet angelo i think they will be happy as well to see you it is a wonderful work this uh this was the first time that i'm working in community work and artistic uh projects and it's just it's very nice and the because so much people you know so you it's very nice it's very nice to work so i'm so i'm i guess uh since uh it will be for a long time i guess at some point you can pass by well yeah yeah hopefully i can make it let's see how the situation will go yeah yeah okay i think i will go back to bdmx because i'm working on the content for uh the piece of marco torrice for melting pot so uh we just closed the the recording now yeah i think so then we go back to backstage and yes thank you for watching thank you", "t3TcSW7lG0E": "yeah now it's recording so yeah i i i could um yeah how are you so you don't have a camera today hello so yeah how's going after when was the last time we met like two days ago or something three days it seems it seems like one week ago but it was just on wednesday yeah yeah so today's saturday three days ago right was uh that was intense i feel like i'm not intense have you actually watched it afterwards no i couldn't did you i watched yeah i watched parts watching forms yeah saying i think it's okay like it's it's a bit long to watch for the whole two hours um but there are some interesting parts in it like i was like i sent you some links like i was working playing with i didn't watch the last link that you send me uh there was a hydra link it's okay that's something else i mean it's related um but uh it's the same same idea i was anyways let's go back to the practice i really like the part when i was playing the previous practice and i left the room yeah that was good yeah yeah that was kind of but did we talk oh yeah we talked afterwards in the in the chat that would be on public uh about the playback because of the playback idea so i think you were doing something like that and i think it's a good idea to to maybe propose for the next time to consciously do something about the playback yeah yeah what i noticed was like um like how you code because you're in the same room but also like how you code the poster is like as always you know have the same like you have the same poster and then that really messes up my mind like you're wearing different clothes but like different t-shirts but uh you look like doing the same thing in different windows right yeah i have the same feeling with when i have because i have i put uh together the first last practices and i have the same impression with you yeah because you have the same clothes yeah it was funny because that's something i consciously do but i think you're just you know a habit or whatever the space that um looks the same in a different time and this is like i don't know what like i wanted to say but this is something really gives the depth it's not at first i was just thinking that it makes it like um more complex in a way this whole practice by having different time in parallel but it's also like aesthetically it's really interesting because as a viewer i can focus on like different parts of the video right it's no longer like one thing and you can actually as like as a viewer you can make your own story because like not everyone's looking at the same thing i mean the way hope i don't know if i completely understand what you're saying but how i see this this playback thing is that it works very well when the offset is not that long uh i mean not not literally in terms of time because in time it will work but also the setup as you said um because then it gives if you think in sound for instance these oscillations they work like the sine and cosine cosine wave they work but when they don't have the offset is not that long because otherwise are completely two different things when the set the offset is just a tiny bit in uh offset then you have uh how it's called resonance no um oh it's called what is called um how it's called some kind of filter some kind of filter that you get when you have this slightly uh offset you mean like with the sound we just i mean with the sound but in a way generates the same i mean i'm just doing like putting things together but in a way it in sound is very clear because the wave if there is a cosine and design at some point they are differently but at some point they cross and when they cross then they generate this filter i don't remember the name for that but it's just some sort of specific sound that is being created of that moment um but are you talking about like when you have two different like slightly different frequencies yes start to feel hear the low frequency oscillations yeah yeah the low pass yeah low pass high pass yeah low passes so anyways and i'm just thinking that is a it's similar somehow i don't know like scientifically speaking but i'm just doing my conjunction this should be somehow a similar effect when we when the playback is slightly offset yeah yeah i think um it makes sense like the link actually the second link i sent you is something um totally different but what i did was um i recorded a video from a train like i was i was on the train and just looking outside the window and recorded for like 15 minutes and then i took it at home i played that and i was live coding with hydra to create images on top of this i'm using this video buffer so i was live coding for 15 minutes with the same duration for the same video and then i put them together so i have the original video i have uh actually another recording of the keyboard like how i'm typing um together with the hydra that gives effect and also there's a uh like the editor that shows what i was calling okay and like the link like for the one i sent you before with the practice it's the same thing like i was doing the practice and like there's a live editor that was showing what i was calling during the practice but not in the video but on the web page and in both cases like you can just uh scroll the the playback head and jump to another place and it's still it's continuing with uh you know it follows the the time that i quoted in the practice or in this video which um so why i'm saying this well in this case the the latter one i did was has a lot of offset in that sense because i was filming outside the train and i was filming the keyboard that i was typing but which i found really nice was that i could see my hand typing and that's also affects the editor that's shown on the web page so as i type in the video it shows up on the editor [Music] and the train video is something totally different but like you make the correlation between the editor the code i'm typing and the keyboard i'm using which i've i felt it's really interesting and i think it's more obvious in the practice because i'm i'm actually there and i'm coding and you can see the editor as well [Music] and it's not just me myself but it's also with you and me and the videos blended um with uh in the practice we had this you know this swirl thing at the end and i don't yeah yeah i think i made it full screen uh blending between our bodies and then uh as soon as i become you so i'm not on the screen anymore i start typing let me start coding uh add more effects or text but actually i think in your video you can see me coding yeah because you had the light clap open so like it just like constantly changes like switches like jumps around the attention you know in the two videos and the editor and if i have more videos for example with uh keyboard typing and stuff like that that could be also interesting i see i see what i mean so yeah like i think it's like offset is one thing that also like how you correlate things because if they are like totally different videos then they yeah it doesn't it doesn't work i mean or it might work but i just think it's more difficult i think as a viewer you try to understand what's behind it right okay yeah yeah i don't know but yeah like it sometimes works sometimes doesn't work or the artist doesn't have any idea why they put these videos but also like it's hard like if you think about this offset it's hard to make content like create bunch of contents that shares the same context like in our case we in our case can you repeat what you said so just have a make a bunch of videos that look similar let's say so we can play with but then making those videos it's actually hard because it's not like you have to do something repeatedly right or you have to constantly look for something that has similar aesthetics but in our case it's easy because we have the practice every week or so and we have a bunch of videos already yeah we have their kai yeah and i think that's something like i think it makes sense that this discussion is happening now like not uh when we started practice because that's not something we expected to have like kind of safe practice one of the same but you know like similar uh well we have the same protocol more or less and we continue it so now we have this archive but at first we didn't think about making an archive yeah it just made me think now that could you imagine like what what would be if we because basically we talk in a way it seems to me it's like goals uh around an ontological process they're trying to define what are what are the elements of what are the things that we do and try to make some sort of sense of what are they uh so can you try to imagine like that in a practice we try to really you know try to understand okay now to wait why are you using this keyword you know like that could be completely different you know because it's like i understand partly of what you said but most of what you said is my interpretation of what you're saying so if in the context of the practice i really try to just understand why are you taking those decisions what does this video means to you when you don't it will be completely different yeah well i think we talked about this before but um yet we have this chat to somehow you know come back to the ideas behind your decisions in a way yeah which is which is good because it doesn't happen during the practice otherwise it will be just you know i don't know how it's going to be like maybe you can try one time just try to explain everything you're doing but i think sometimes it happens more in development time though you or me are busy and at some point we start trying to explain something to the other one and the other one might pay attention for certain periods but if it takes too long then just you continue from what you're doing and while the other one keeps on trying to explain yeah and that's very funny okay maybe yeah shall we stop the the chat and then we can talk uh yeah more yeah so please subscribe i don't know if i'm going to publish this though i probably do i think this is interesting yeah thank you for watching", "j40Ol3XKpM4": "hello hello good morning everyone or good afternoon or evening or wherever you are or whenever you're watching but now we are in the morning yes and uh yeah just let go let's go straight to the topic so which one like i wrote a few things well two things to you uh let me let me let me go back uh thinking about you said you said to me so um thinking about trackable qualities the therm the term came from the choreographic coding lab you shared that with me at some point i think i'm not interested in in inherent qualities to be tracked i don't know what you mean wait but let me finish today so you see like i think i'm not interested in inherent qualities to be tracked but rather elements that become quality by being tracked that's very that's that's very interesting but if you can maybe uh end yourself a bit more and when you said you are not interested in inherent qualities yeah uh i don't know what how to start because so basically yesterday i was just playing with uh with the peacemaker from motionbank which basically you can you know um place different videos and annotate and uh the original idea is that you have different views of the same rehearsal or performance with the different you know angles with cameras and and they're like synchronized so if you want to go to scene one or whatever you annotate you can just click on it and then the videos will jump to that scene and you can also combine like movement uh like motion tracking and stuff so anyways how do i say it's it's about like understanding a dance piece or rehearsal from different viewpoints but it's in a single timeline but i was uh using it in a different way so that i just randomly put like a few videos from the practices and just made some um annotations at 10 minutes 20 minutes 30 minutes and so on so that if you just click on it then they're not in the same timeline but i have many videos that um jump to that playback position so okay let me let me try to to see if i understand so what you did is like you put different sessions that we have and then just you put them all in the playback at certain point yeah so okay so you can just see 20 minutes after it started for from you know the past practices and then um this was something i was doing and then i actually started developing on my own because uh that gives more freedom and that's something i want to work today to create a playback of different videos and then i was i started to think like this itself give gives interesting um perspective right because we see something that's no longer um in the same time but in a way at the same time because that's how we frame the practice and that's something we start to like in a way we invent and and that's not something that we can see by like tracking our bodies or tracking something from the practice itself more like a relation between different practices then i started to think like what else can be added to the practice and like i think like what motion bank does like movement tracking like you know the the motion capture you know like detecting like tracking the position of each body parts that doesn't really add to what we do maybe it does but um i think that's not really interesting but what if we track like what you can get from the computer for example like like how much cpu you are using or ram or even like keystroke or whatever these things that we can log or mouse movements and stuff because i think that gives more or like maybe window positions i don't know if that's possible um that would add something to the practice um and then then i wrote wrote you this message because i what i wrote okay so i think i'm not interested in inherent qualities to be tracked that's something is i mean by what the trackable qualities originally um refers to referred to that's uh like the movement like what what the movement is or uh is the movement soft or rigid or like the quality coming from the the movers perspective yeah i think this idea was that uh because we only see the position of like what the computer c sees is the position of body parts for example uh or velocity but these you know new numerical values and you can all get if it's let's say soft or is it fluid and the idea was that how can we understand or not understand these qualities by tracking movements but then i was like that's really how do i say imperative like it's really like top down [Music] in a sense that um it's like the the surgeon uh idea that we had that uh we are like the you know we do the operation on the dancing body yeah that already creates you know separation of the digital part the technological part and the dance yeah um but then like how i was thinking about you know mixing these different videos jumping between different playback or tracking computer itself is probably something useless in a sense of the mover because it's it has nothing to do with the the body in a way you mean you mean tracking the non-dancing things that normally you're tracking when you try to track the body in a dance context right like you wouldn't care how much cpu you're using or what's you know these things yeah yeah for our practice it's something that can be added and that may be more useful than tracking the bodies yeah and that's like the the elements that i said that or record and or the playback of the video itself you know like 10 minutes after the practice 20 minutes these things that normally doesn't make sense i mean okay choreography wise maybe it makes sense but uh but let's say cpu or how many windows you're open this kind of thing that starts to make sense in uh our practice and if we archive like in an archival purpose or you know like not just archiving but creating something new out of the archive that's something that you know like what we wrote in the proposal and also um we talked about uh anyways like i'm just yeah because we talked about the your uh presentation that we might do like one day streaming but actually like we recorded in advance or something uh yeah and just mix with you know play with that uh playback and our bodies like in real life i mean the the light so yeah like i just started thinking that this could be something we can focus yeah like focus a little bit and see what we can do and that you know just like maybe there are some things that we've been ignoring but it could be used or not used but give life or birth yeah okay i see what i mean [Music] i have to say that i'm trying to think like how how i still because i think going back to this idea of life and death then is if we agree that we are alive during the practice in that context that elements are alive and that we are alive and the practice is alive during that context i will say that any element that we use it must be alive during the any boot count that is part of the practice during the the practice um that said for instance if you use playbacks like as we do sometimes like it's not that we cannot record the past because we can use it but we can use it in the practice so in the present things from the past um but uh so yeah i think what i'm trying to say is more that then i will take care or like would like to think and how not to use archiving of data just in in just from because of the of the quality of the past in there in the data um saying that i would be i would i i think there will be the straightforward way to use data i think will be if somehow we can track let's say use this somehow this um how they call like track trackable qualities but i think i like i think it's is it suits the name so in somehow we used some of these trackable qualities i think the straightforward to make it work during the within the concept will be live [Music] but that doesn't mean that we cannot that it it doesn't mean that we cannot use uh pre-recorded data we can use pre-recorded data uh of data that we have used somehow um but yeah so i guess what i'm trying to share more is like i will have this concern of like and to to not let the because what the danger that i see with the data is since the data it can be so first like over one because can be so much of data that it might take over of what we do um so it's more like kind of seeing from that perspective um i see but i think that would be very very interesting it just it's completely it's a really low level of uh element which i think is is it's very very very nice yeah one thing like i was thinking is because i was working with the the windows in the last sessions and i started to think like what if like i uh record the position of the windows and then um because i was looking at the youtube api yesterday like you can embed videos and you can set the playback position with the code so you can just like uh say after you start the video after 10 seconds you just like skip to a certain position or go back to certain position with playback speed of you know two times faster or something um that you can easily do and yeah i was thinking like if we if i record all the the window position then i can do something like uh modify the css so that the window stays there the whole thing looks something like that and this is like that makes sense yeah because this is like i was thinking not just an archival purpose but i wanted to use like how i can use the archive in the practice like i think it's really nice to think that way so it's not like you know having a nice shelf to store the data but like where to put the data and play with it and actually and actually it makes so much sense in the sense of like in that sense like the archiving is not only for people to go and click and watch but it's just actually something that we actively use so it's like giving agency to this thing to come back in different times that is not like for instance like and it happens often then the la the last time the uh we ended using the voice of a chat yeah yeah that was the sound that we use you remember in the last practice we used a chat that we have that we keep laughing yeah and that was not and that was just like it was just something that it came out so and and it felt good because it does it was us so it's part of the archiving so it goes in the same direction yeah so again it's like going against uh like not just motion bank but you know like kind of purifying our body on the digital media but we just you know keep contaminating what's there but actually that's that's how we can like blend ourselves into the medium um this is is this thing that you use for the windows is like a javascript framework or what is it yeah it's just a standard javascript api but i need to find a way to really nicely recorded and allow them to break because i will you know i will be still coding during the practice so whatever can happen i don't want to like the the fear is that i don't want to have um program that i have to run and like not to touch it for the whole practice and try to keep it stable and working all the time like that's not gonna work i know that it's not going to work that like that is not going to work because it fails and it also gives me so much pressure that you know okay i should not touch this you know if i restart this it's going to be messed up against the spirit of the practice like like it yeah it will give you stress yeah true it's a bit like the hubs that just keep breaking yeah because now i see what do you mean what he meant on yeah definitely i said i think it's a uh um very very interesting uh thought like it's a very interesting like how i mean as well technically you know like in terms of applications of things like you know depending of because it just gives like technically wise it gives so much challenge uh but at the same time since what we do i mean what i'm what i think is that so far that um the complexity of what we do it should not get so much perceived uh in the practice that's what i think right now uh like the complexity of what we do which it should not get perceived like showed up in what we do let's say if you really will like to start like working with a javascript framework or something like that it's just uh like for instance like i know myself then it will take me more time to get used to that or something so what i'm saying is that at this point because i don't understand yet what does that mean actually like that complexity that intensity in the practice itself you know the frustrat like what i'm saying is like the frustration within the elements that we work so far is working like when you have your frustration because you have a flow of work i have my frustrations over bdmx or hydra or some things so there's a there's a reiterative process of frustration with the elements that so far it seems that it comes and goes and in certain way so what i'm thinking is using other frameworks um and then allowing the frustration i mean knowing that those things might be a up a a  up like uh it's it might it might be a different thing that is not that we cannot do it but it's just something that we have to be conscious that okay now we're gonna try this we can try it even today now we can try like so that we said now we're trying this so we know that i mean yeah you know what i mean you know what i'm trying to say no but in this sense like to me it really helps the how we do it now with the development and practice because like clearly separate you know the development and maybe first you know 30 minutes of the practice is like i try to allow myself to spend time you know sit down and code which i don't want in the perform or performance or practice but like after a certain time in the practice i will not do it if if it's something that is keep breaking that i will be stressed then i will not use it and that's really clear to me so that like i really like keep myself safe in a sense safe from the technology actually i see what i mean i think definitely is like a very very interesting uh thing uh it's a it's a it's a is it's a new if you think like as a soup like the practice it's like a new like a new thing to put in the soup uh and i like it because already i mean you you share i mean since we've since the the the background of the practice comes from this uh from this from from what you propose it as uh with from the framework of the choreographic coding lab and so it is interesting like then then to i mean it's not f it's not a way is not away from this uh trackable qualities that the motion bank proposes uh yet is different yeah i mean it's uh like it's the same same i like like uh how to say like process as like how we liberate our bodies by using the the glitches but i think it's something that i had in my mind as a reference the strikable qualities or whatever striking things that they've been doing and we've been like not conscious about it you know we're just doing whatever that we like to do but it's not that we're just trying to do something you know crazy but we always have like good reference of what others are doing and slowly we start to like find ourselves like where we are standing with regard to all these other things and now it becomes really interesting that um like in a way like i feel more secure that it's not really like it's still like the practice itself the concept is really vulnerable but i don't really feel any more like what i don't know what we are doing but it's okay that we're not we don't know what we're doing but still like we see what others are doing and yeah that's really cool and it's you know we we came really far with this i think i think is i think this is the dimension is very relevant like it's like medicine or it's like things in general but in medicine as well i guess because you said about the surgeon uh in technology also that if although what we do is so we have a framework but we are you know in a context then you need to keep up updating what is happening in the world right uh otherwise just you end up getting in one bubble and and i think that's not the purpose so i think this idea of like trying to keep an eye of what other ones are doing and since our framework is very relaxed it's our things are super welcome to come and just test and try it and but i think it's nice if we can like not perform but somehow put this like oh like have um like i want to have like a snapshot of where we are right now like maybe it's a writing maybe it's a more structured chat or it's just a chat like what we do but more conscious about like or maybe this is actually a snapshot i mean it is um but like i just wanted to have a nice view of like where we are at some point to um you know so that we can look back i mean of course we can just look at each chat in the past but um let's say like they're like more like sketches so it would be nice to uh have it somewhere i don't know just proposing good good to me good to me so i think maybe we could close the chat yeah thanks for watching thank you please whatever like us very much oops i was about to end meeting stop recording", "HMVQ6oxLiuk": "hello i don't know if this is going to be official chat or something else oh my god sorry i'm sleepy i'm really sleepy uh is it gonna be backstage informal or i don't know like it's it's weird right now i have to ask you but let's say the things is a before i don't know but casual chat maybe you can start from what you just you you said to me [Music] like the practice became developing yeah how was it that for you um yeah so it felt like at least to me well maybe it was different for you because you were doing hydra and you were making the composition it wasn't really nice but for me i was like writing and then coding a bit and writing and then it became it became like this is like development it's not like practice um there are so many interesting things happened i think i mean i don't know if it's something that i liked or not and if i want to continue like this um but this kind of questioned the the format basically yeah yeah i see because we had two hours and at one point i don't know what like an hour and a half or something like i was like really into writing and coding changing the code um and then i i noticed i lost you i mean you're somewhere yeah i went to get something and then i was like i kept doing a little bit and then i decided to leave so that the computers are doing something oh but it was really nice something that you did today that you did you did not before was you were using two different cameras at some point you have your computer and two different cameras like when i went outside yeah yeah it was really funny because like you mean the the front and back cameras yeah you have to different coverage yeah yeah i didn't expect that but when i went outside first i tried with the the back camera to see you know like with the phone that's on you know the back side not the selfie camera to show what's around yeah but then live lab you can have multiple cameras so i like might as well just do a selfie camera as well so i have both you can do that on live lab yes wow i didn't know that that's amazing yeah because normally you have to use i mean i use different iphones uh phones for that wow that's super cool amazing so that was something new that's super cool but it was really cold i mean it's really windy so i just decided to come back but um yeah and it's it's the park just in the it's like a backyard so i could catch wi-fi yeah that would be nice to do it in the wild at some point we never did it right i mean you went outside sometimes yeah i went outside sometimes but this is the first time you were doing it and that was nice you know that was very because it's completely different it changes the atmosphere drastically so if i'm looking at live lab i have all these screens and somehow they have the same feeling but then when you go outside it's completely different true that's completely different so it just demands that you know that if i'm looking it just demands attention i cannot avoid not to look at what what are you doing i see it's really nice no yeah it's not something you used to no also because i mean it's just you go outside there was some windy at some point your hair was moving like that yeah that was really nice so many many many things that just because you are outside with the elements that's already very complex in image let's say very i think the the two hours it felt to fail okay for me i mean less longer than the last time um i don't know how long were you um it was long it was long oh yeah something i wanted to say like so i wrote to you like it became like a development and to me it was and i think it felt like throughout the practice it felt like i was developing like more like you know constantly doing something and gradually build up something but also it really because we agreed that it's not a development but it's a practice it really um demands to be somewhat performative i don't know if that's the right word because we say it's not a performance but you know like a performative sense like sometimes like towards the end like we were you know playing with the uh like i was playing with you know half of the maze and we're like aligning them so it's not like you know you just like suddenly smile and you know okay this is something i'm doing but you know we just don't talk and we're doing this and that's that i felt really nice it was um yeah i don't know if it was interesting as an image but uh it was really nice to make nice experience yeah i mean for me like i i think that's what i was trying the place that eventually i would like to to arrive or to is when i said when when i was proposing to end together uh it's basically towards trying to get in out of what we do you know like uh as the last time i think i was trying to explain like in terms of dancing and just like this movie this film stopped image and then continuing that i guess this example like with david zambrano we were doing this and then just catching right away from when you left like between being super serious or performative and drop it being just normal and just keep on going um and in that regard i think something so for reason at the beginning we are more chatting no so we are more chatty we laughed the first time so like we hear the sound that was super weird the sound with the low speed of the conversation that was very funny but i like it i like it yeah yeah i mean especially because it's from it's our videos yeah that's what i thought that's what i thought it was nice because it's just about what we do yeah yeah so then but it was just by chance so i thought it was a nice element just by chance in the practice and then wait and then what [Music] chat sound in the background um okay yeah i mean in and out and um yeah i mean yeah so then the beginning in a way like we are but but i think it's because we have this time frame i think it's so important today was very conscious of that while we were doing that it just gives so much flexibility because then i know it's two hours so then i know i can take ten five 5-10 minutes if i just need it like i went to eat and i met some people and then after i realized wow i need to go back i forgot it i spent like 10 minutes outside eating but it's completely uh when i left it was half an hour so i know anyway i will not be away they have an hour so it just this element of the of this pay of the time is so yeah i think this element of time in our case it actually proposes the space which is very maybe it makes sense i don't know like in a natural world i don't know it makes sense but in the space that we are playing it makes sense because we propose time so time recording time which is the space that we share the performativity that we share and so that's that's uh that's basically the lifetime that all performance performance uh of the practice that's the lifetime that your persona or my persona uh are alive uh in the practice for the session is a contract so it's a binding contract that actually i was thinking today just frees me to just be uh to give to not get actually stressed about i need to communicate with you that we need to end you know that was that the proposal that i had before was very it was very challenging you know like that's that's a very uh in our case i see the time is it is the space in the in in our case it's the finest they find is defines the the life that you that we have there the life that we create yeah that's very interesting because because when we meet in person we know that we're there and that's something it's not relative but we know that absolute spot is there and we're there but if it's online it's hard to have that sense because anytime i can leave so we need some kind of reference which is time because time flows well maybe there is a fraction of a second of you know like um error between different places but still like we know that it flows almost the same for both of us and that's why we yeah it's just like sensing the space we sense the time and we share that it's yeah like we only have 30 minutes 10 minutes that we both sense even though we're not physically there all right which is really interesting yeah i think that like it seems to me clear it makes sense that time in in the in the practice is the space it is the living space that we have because when the time is gone then we are gone in that space we still exist here and we will exist in the recording in the future when we upload it and then it just becomes part of the network and it just it it's a red distribute in the network where for that person that wants to watch it so we we kind of multiply ourselves in different places and then we don't have control over that so that's part of like we just put it out right but before that while we are in like or life like in the real life then is a bit weird because if i'm thinking for instance it's like so the time in the in that space is like it will take the same time in our lives you know it's like it's two hours two hours and the practice is two hours in my life right um but the difference is that that knowing that while practicing i have two hours to end my life you know out in two hours i will end my life my session life your session life in two hours i will be gone in that in that sense will be will be death in a way like all the elements all the agency of these things that we are creating all the imaginary all these things that takes time until they boil up they will be gone for forever they will just ex there will be they will become alive again in the in the youtube channel as a different source but it's but it's not it's not there in a way who i see it is like there is this we go together like life real life and the life in the practice and we are together moving because the time it goes like this uh like normal yeah but at some point guy this life dies from the from the practice and yeah i don't know what i wanted to say yeah well to me i was thinking more like i was just thinking about because you said life i was thinking about like super mario because that's oh are you still there or do i have to do the monologue again okay you're back i think or not i mean this is the weird thing about time that it's it feels the same but we don't necessarily share the same time in a way because of the network uh okay going back to what i want to say um i thought like a super mario because we know that the this life life will end but then after one week we do it again you know it's a same amount of life but it's a different life there is something interesting in this idea of the death because it just comes from this part of this text about hegel and judith butler uh and if i'm not wrong basically you have this it wasn't this analogy of analogy of the master slave and then the the slave uh doesn't know life uh it has no independent life and you see it's the life the life of the slave is through the eyes of the master the slave doesn't know life he just somebody who is born a slave thinks that master is life a slave doesn't cannot decide by themselves through the master they become alive basically um they don't have will they but um and then the master of the bondage i think he calls him the bondage you say the master because i don't want to forget the mix the names so say the master the master has no freedom because uh although it sounds weird but because no wait oh let me try to put it short and just concretely what i'm trying to say is that through dying in the text what they're saying is through dying is that actually life becomes possible in the text in the sense of the master cannot leave although the master is the one who is ordering what to do he's his uh task as master it limits his uh life in a way from from that in that perspective it the the text says in a way that it has no life is not alive because it cannot chooses it it chooses based on by on [Music] uh on limitation basically well for the slave the slave is free because he doesn't have to choose he has no option so in that sense the slave is free and the master is slay in the master in a way is enslaved because the master has no has no freedom he needs to choose always and because of that he's uh he cannot be totally free and therefore he cannot be alive and then when they say the slave therefore when the slave at some point he will die and he will die in a way on the name of the master so he will die on when he died actually he uh will become he becomes alive um [Music] and why how how what is the logic of why he becomes alive um there is something there that is in my subconscious like in that regard when i was that's what i was mentioning this that is death it comes from that text because it's clear in the text that once you the in the text that when the slave died he's free he's free actually no history when he is slave died he's alive he's fully alive that's what they said that um and then actually then butler is trying to put that analogy in terms of the text is called be my body for me uh and is this uh from this idea that my body is my slave he has no choice that just uh surrender to my self self awareness and then i just tell my body do the things that i need to do my body is just and from that perspective the text says that uh butter make the analogy between the body who is a slave of my what i think is jorge the image of what i think and then in that exercise then then they go different iterations trying to say like that you the proposing this idea of self dissociation of the self like one example is that if i start like right now i'm somewhat understanding that you are there and recognizing that is me but if i try to do like close my eyes and try to just really feel my belly i have to do an exercise of dissociation and imagination in which i'm becoming somehow i'm separating from jorge and i'm start feeling my belly um and like these are different exercises uh that they propose what i think is relevant from there is that because i think we do that i that's what the in the direction in a way who i'm thinking lately in the or exercise when i when i talk about the elements it's in this is in this idea of like self-dissociation of like the elements become somewhat me but it's not my fully consciousness of jorge it's just who becomes now a glitch or the cursor or you uh in different layers and anyway maybe it's get is confused but but in a way i think it's interesting is this idea of bringing uh life and death in the in uh in our practice because it seems to me clear that we this thing that we do becomes alive and died when we agree beforehand just to so this life and death i just um yeah i i think i need more understanding to comment on it but i just want to pick up what you said about the glitches i think it's really interesting that you said it and in the text i was writing like not the the the practice writing but the in the development writing the proposal thing i was writing i just made up like something about pixel space or something so that i avoid saying it's a video effect um i'm still not 100 happy with the name but it makes sense i mean i didn't i just wrote it because in a sense that bodies become part of the the data and the video yeah but i think what you said really add something to it because in a way we are equal like there's no like like there's no hierarchy in the pixels true so whatever images whatever recordings your video feed my video feed doesn't really matter it's just uh rgb and alpha pixels and that's really that's really cool yeah yeah i didn't thought about it like this actually there is not really i mean we can go in that direction sometimes i guess from time to time on purpose but if in the pure exercise of just doing the practice the political uh body it doesn't exist because uh you are just glitch i mean like you are not japanese there you know right and that's very interesting so like the there is yeah that's i never thought like that but it's is really true yeah it's really um i don't know how to say but it's really funny um funny in a way um very liberating it's very liberating actually if you really think about it yeah i mean it's funny because it's not something that we intended to do and i think if we intend to do so to liberate ourselves by using pixels probably we will fail because it becomes because yeah then it just as you said is because by chance it happened it's liberating but i guess it will be if the quest was towards aiming to free the body through the practice then it just becomes charged already yeah it's already having a strong connection to it so you won't perceive as pixels that you perceive as your body or each other's body and i also think because for instance like although these things that we talk are you know somewhat interesting you know when i mentioned some things like than the dead and then you mentioned like you bring this into the conversation and then from time to time we have interesting topics at the end actually all that we talk actually is fluid you know we are not trying to arrive or just trying to write a book about the best practices well maybe we can write a book but you know it's not like the book is not the the end no no and that's why i think is uh it will not it will not have work anyway we will in in just following the nature of the process uh it wouldn't work i mean it's just it's not although it's for instance if you see many of these topics they come often like this political body and other other more they come very often when we talk or in the chat or in backstage we talk constantly of these things so are are they reflect actually where are we as humans you know as as individuals yeah it's not something yeah it's mean constantly changing and it's how do i say um yeah i mean it's just like you know we're just flowing somehow and we find something interesting we might forget about what we've been talking in january but that's also okay and we can always go back and we can criticize or whatever but it doesn't matter what any the nice thing is like we don't reflect too much on the chat because but if we do that that's weird because at some point i thought like i mean i'm sure we have interesting things that is is nice from time to time as you do and as i do sometimes just almost randomly like click in one of the chats and then you go back and then you laugh because they're it's like it's it's so so the difference um that exists between watching ourselves in the practice and watching ourselves in the chat in the past because we cannot do it in the future yet um is that is actually just what you said because there is no political when you watch the the the practice itself it's just more it's just more a negotiation between your ego in terms of how how good it is you know in terms of you as an artist like seeing like does it work now like in different levels so it's more a desire desire uh failure uh and just all this conversation in your head with yourself like does it work does it not work but um [Music] you're not really i mean there's not too much you know just i i when i watch i just jump fast to see things you know there's i don't stop that much or if i stop it's because there is an aesthetic actually something there for me to watch often but on the other hand when we jump like from time to time just to chats there is always something there is catching you know like then you and that sometimes is funny because then just be mentioned somebody or for whatever reason and and that's because those actually are ourselves like the ones in the practice is not the self that i'm talking right now you know it's not the now auto that i'm talking right now the one in the practice is every single time uh a different one i mean here also you are different but there is just so because of the multi-dimensionality that we propose it's just so exposed to the infinite right here i mean here you're not the same that 10 minutes ago but it's is the in the other one the dimensions are so just waiting constantly true yeah um i don't know like i'm just like so happy that we discovered something um yeah and a bit sleepy so i i wasn't sure like what else i can talk like i feel like now like it's good like this this chat was good maybe something that i wanted to say is like because in regards of this like for those for those who are following the chat there's more the people for instance there's the double of people who watch the chat than the practices that's that's a fact uh so for those who watch the chat and this one it seems very in a way conceptual or my there to say like academic in the sense like you know like very more theoretical let's say um and we were like very yes hmm interesting like uh if you compare the difference i guess this was not that much but so what i was trying to say is like in the developing time so we proposed today to do this developing time of two hours and then uh we said that we're gonna work with text because now auto was writing an application um and then uh how what i don't remember development was writing and practice also was writing i think yeah i don't know what i was trying to say somehow is that we talk a lot today i know i think it was before development we used maybe like one hour just to talk we were not actually just the last five minutes 10 minutes we said by the way what are we gonna do tonight today but we spend like one hour just chit chatting what's that like you mean in the morning in the morning could be just the place always just the last five minutes ten minutes we said okay but just how are we gonna work but the beginning was just like i was so sleepy you were so sleepy you both were like yeah to be honest i don't know i cannot think right now and i just honestly i don't want i don't want development today that's what i said yeah yeah and so i mentioned that because actually is in regards to you remember when we have this chat some week ago or something like bearing a personal level so backstage they end up being backstage uh the late one the late one yeah so i see it in the same way because today when we were talking at some point i reflect myself like thinking would you talk about work but then i kind of like catch myself in the discourse and then i thought actually this is important this is what we do right now is the practice this is this is actually what it bounce the trust between you and me that just actually we can just talk and do what we need to do and and that was nice so i'm saying that it's just too in regards to like we talk all of these but these things are possible because we trust we build this trust uh in whatever happens basically yeah i was just thinking like when we were meeting in person in frankfurt that was really um felt so how to say uh not vulnerable unstable i don't know disorienting whatever uh because we were not recording our conversations because we were talking in real real life and it's nice but it's also sad like i i wish i could go back to the chinese garden and listen to what we were talking which is a bit funny like it's creepy but um just put hiding microphones in the chinese garden in frankfurt yeah because there must be something interesting there yeah yeah maybe not maybe not interesting it's just nice um maybe i will go through the text again i mean i'm not gonna read that because that was i read this text about butler like in four days with somebody like so it's something that it's i think it's heavy it's already butler so is talking about hegel so it makes it softer because she tried to bring the bring the uh the hecklers uh philosophies of the spirit phenomenology of the spirit into the body but it's still it's just a lot of uh talking talking talking so if i might find like a chapter like it just like like somalinia that i would like to share with you then i just send it because it's in regards to this death uh life and death of the yeah like the death give real life that's the idea i don't know exactly how to explain that but is the idea that when the slave dies he actually leave fully it's only at that moment no no wait is when he realized that he can die he will he start living yes but i don't know how can i explain that i will find it something and then i i can share that yeah because we are dying now to never thought like that like all personas die in the in the in the practice we have affinity life that is agreed before yeah you know what today like um i told you about you know uh saving the the hydra in the url and you know so that you can come back and i didn't do that because uh i was doing like screen share and uh camera stuff so i didn't want to evaluate all so i just kept like writing writing and like like two minutes to to the end like i accidentally erased it and i was like oh  i talked i i told you about this and i did it by myself and then i was like yeah actually yeah i was just doing whatever from becoming white like yeah so i just did like okay whatever i just improvised and like i was trying to pixelate half of myself and i totally failed but uh that was like that was nice it's also like um because i didn't get what are you trying to do what i saw that was pixelated function but i thought what are you doing i didn't get while we were trying to because they were like literally two minutes or one minute yeah so i was just like you know um like running and running running i mean coding and coding and uh trying to get something that i thought about and then i didn't have time but that's also um that's also like reminds me of that like like like life and death because you know i only have two minutes like i cannot say you know can we can we have another extra five minutes can i leave can i leave five minutes more this is wonderful i really like this i really like that too close than the chat here i really like this this thing it's very nice this idea like i'm happy to die every time that we meet yeah and in a way like the next time like you you don't remember how it was for the last five minutes in the last session in a way so it's like a you know you're new born somehow that's really actually a funny thing because if we do the same thing over and over like we must like remember how it was last time but like we just like stupidly spent like first half an hour just doing whatever and like you notice that we only have half an hour and like just always happen it's like uh it's like uh you know like a kids show that you know like the the villains are like always stupid oh yeah like i hear you but i don't know which connection but it's okay so i just i just repeat and then okay so maybe just but wait you were saying something about the newborn that i would like to just can you repeat that last part i know it's just well like in the recording it's it's there probably but it's like you know in the case okay yeah that's fine yeah okay recording is there i don't i don't repeat it then i don't know if i finished it but then whatever that's not so important so okay so um thank you for watching and then yeah yeah so yeah so let me leave bye bye please subscribe like very much", "_RMJYDN1KgM": "record hello everyone i feel so tired already yeah so maybe you can uh what so what what did we do oh my god yeah maybe we don't publish this um it's okay so what we had one hour of development and then well which was just copying data encoding videos and then we had two hours uploading uploading uploading and then we had two hours of practice yeah and also we so we the idea was i proposed at the beginning like yeah to have some video because i i did it in the previous practice to have some base video and then on on that uh yeah start from there but then now to uh he proposed that instead of using our video our own videos we just share the video with the other one um yeah in order to because at some point i was expressing to you that i was struggling while we were in the developing time i was struggling thinking what i'm gonna do with all the material that i have because i have i'm biased with with my own i have my yeah it's my my material no so and then uh now to propose is that uh what if just we use the other one material and that i think that was a great uh proposal because it just freezes space like okay this is just material you know it's it's nothing or it's not personal something yeah true and i think that was no i mean what that was the framework yes and but i i have to say that i didn't really see how you were using the video oh but yeah you were using i mean i was noticing the sound a lot but uh uh in the end well maybe because i didn't really see any live love no i have because i was i was getting la i was using i have so what i did is like i haven't media mx and i think i will repeat it like that i have three windows uh i have one one output right on an output and now i have three layers in bdmx so then the first layer was uh i named it now auto live which was actually it was the switcher from live lab and the second uh layer was nauto video uh was one of your videos and the third one was a question mark that it was uh something so what i did at some point is like uh in the mid so in auto in the video i use some cosine wave to uh put the opacity up and down constantly on the video but it was there it was there like from fading out the video the video the auto video yeah and then i choose i change it sometimes like it was most hey but is it from let's say from the minute 20 no let's say yeah because i think still it took me i i saw the clock it took me like 45 minutes more or less until i got something that i could play with you see i don't know how was with you yeah like i think around that time until around that time i was also debugging which i couldn't fix in the end but like i was really relaxed because you know like i can just take time to debug stuff if it's not working i mean we had two hours so why not and uh it didn't really help but uh i think it was okay in the end because we cannot just dancing for two hours like that but can you repeat what you just said it's okay that i was debugging and just taking time to debug um because i don't think we would dance for two hours for example no i mean something that i have to say like that i i thought like i would like to talk of the in this regard is so first like i thought the experience was very nice very we never have done something like that i can said it was very intense uh it i mean in the sense of tiring uh so what happened at the end like we were moving a lot because yeah i don't know i think i don't know what happened with so like one really strong element was the the video loop that you recorded live yeah that was funny because then and it happens like the last time as well like because then you don't know what i'm playing that then i i the first thing is like i have a question and you thought actually that i have another question and then you answer like yes i mean but it was just a video and that element always is like that was really funny but soon i noticed and then i was like just pretending that it happened again with the same question so i was already saying that like just i because i remember what i said so i was saying same thing in regards to that yeah i i saw you saying something like yeah yeah because then well i was not sure if you would notice that it was from the video or me saying that maybe it was clear for you i don't know oh yeah it was clear for me it was you because i can see your lips okay okay if you're seeing the myself in like life then yeah because since i have my three screens and the right screen is the output of vdmx and the middle one i have bdmx and then the left one is live lab i see well today actually it was interesting because like for the last practices i was using the you know the multi window thingy that i today i was also using it um but for the last time like i had i always had live lab and you know the windows were like moving on top of it on top of live lab but today i was doing it for some time and then at the end i just decided to uh not close but minimize live lab and i only had the google docs as a like a big screen the google docs what do you mean the the shared document oh so you have ah yeah of course now now it makes sense because yeah while i'm performing i don't know what is happening no i'm just like trying to go with the flow but now i understand yeah of course your background was the the text and then the windows are moving and sometimes i well just twice but i took the screenshot and pasted it in the document right i see yeah that makes sense what it was really fun because like you also build up the document as you perform for practice yeah i like it i mean i like i like that we are getting more what i like from this session that we have lately is that we in a way i feel that we get more it seems to me that the elements are getting more they get more independent you know like before we were kind of like just using live lab and then just glitching and then doing effects that they were working for what we do but now it seems that we although we do that then as well we slowly start like like for reason as you said like in somehow for whatever reason you decided to use a document as a background and that and as well then because i was using i was overs no i was using a negative contrast on that document it was black sometimes on on mine uh so yeah from my perspective it seems to me that this things that i call elements it seems that they slowly this target that we are getting more conscious of these things you know like oh okay maybe now i can this maybe now i can that yeah i think um this uh how do you say it composition or the stage design or something with the the screen is really getting something and um like before we were always thinking that live lab is always there but i think we're getting like we have more options and live lab somehow became like just one element and it's not like always like we're not standing on top of pipeline but there are so many things we can play with yeah i do agree wait document and i really like when you took the the fruit i like when you add the fruit stuff i really like that if we had it from the beginning what i i left it on my desk from the beginning because i i knew that i could play with it oh so it was a conscious decision from you yeah i mean i mean i already did it before and you know it's nothing new but that i was thinking like i can but i don't have to but yeah that's but but that's you know that's what i mean like i think we're getting advanced in that sense like because that's a conscious decision like of you you take the decision like i have the experience with this before and somehow this work before i might do it if i feel there is something that i mean like if for some reason like you feel that you want to give agency to that element to become part of what you're doing just you will let it to be but you don't have to and you are conscious of that and and i think it was a perfect time when i had the like the feedback of windows yeah yeah that was really fun i mean it's it's nothing new but it was fun well i mean from my point of view like from my point of view like chronographically speaking i i really think that we are getting advanced in this in this uh yeah composition otherwise so for however we want to call it uh that we are getting more conscious of what might happen yeah you know like uh i was just talking with somebody like with adriano and yesterday when i when we finished when when i know i was doing when i was when i finished then i um then i met him on the on the kitchen and then i told him i was doing something and then he and then he kind of like was he was saying something but i was just decompressing from being four hours of just being working then i i kind of like i i think i yeah i don't know exactly how i react and and then i felt a bit guilty about it afterwards [Music] so [Music] um i just mentioned so i just i was just when we finished i went to smoke a cigarette in the smoking room but now you know it and then he came as well like he was there so i expressed that well he he saw that i was like you know like just decompressing from this and then he's like out uh how are you then i told him hi we are just finishing and then i told him a bit of this and then i was uh yes that's what i was talking about this i was telling him that um that what we do in a way seems to me because i'm that we are consciously doing this uh exercise of self-dissociation you know like dissociation of the self that in a way like judy butler speaks and we read this text with him and this is something that or danielle speaks of i mean it's something that it comes in away from this idea of like materialism like when you really give agency to things you know so uh yeah somehow it's without going too deep into that so basically like to um to consciously like uh dissociate the self so like the the consciousness like this thing that i have right now it's me talking to you this is my consciousness this is my selfness in a way and so when we do when we are in the practice then because when you dance for instance because i was trying to to say to him like when we dance you know as the dancers like you are trying to do that exercise with the body you try to dissociate and let the body be right and then what then the thing is what we do is like we do that but we multiply that with with more elements so uh if you see with you see what i mean um something i was like while you were saying i was thinking it's really something new that's coming out is we're not like what you said is not just about playing with the screen like we like i think at first like like sometime before like i was using i was conscious about you know like how i was i'm captured with the camera and how how i appear in the space and how these effects that triggered and you know does something to me that was like what i used to think but like today or like like for the last few practices or like especially today like what you said is totally true in a way that is like different from working with the the screen like because windows start to move and we have i don't know like you had the video loop and we were like moving together while i was actually not really seeing you and all these things are it's it's not really rational but we are like just making our own new or maybe not new but um not a standard how to say it it's a practice yeah that is like we're giving birth to some kind of new practice that yeah so yeah yeah i think so because it seems to me that's what i i say like in regards like to give it it feels that it gives agency to things to happen and i think the proof of that is because i didn't understood just now that you're telling me that your background was your document like if we will start like for instance not in the practice but in in let's say in development time because i'm in myself then i will recognize that's the document but because we are in the practice i'm just it's just it's not the document you know it's just something that is there and i just take it as as as the element that it comes uh so i think as a kind of like it proves this thing that to me that some of the things that are happening they are not just those elements anymore but they just start getting its own life and i think it works because also like i'm not just putting the document as a background but there i mean i was doing it but there was a conscious decision that it's not that i wanted to make it not obvious but yeah just just that's like the element i was treating it as an element to it instead of you know just putting something interesting oh i don't know how to say just um i thought i did it because it's not just it's interesting but clearly like i thought that would be an agent or whatever that yeah okay that's cool actually this that you're saying is very cool because i didn't thought of that but actually what i wish i could do in the practice or so i guess i do at some somehow is that i wish to give you agency to do things right so and you just said like that your this your conscious decision of like using the the the document as a canvas was in order like to give agency for things to happen there true in a way in a way if you want to go even more crazy in a way it's like seems to me that we can't dissociate your yourself like now we can dissociate ourselves like and you can go almost in the future not consciously that you can foresee what can be what can happen if i allow this you know like if you say like that i put the document because maybe some windows will be moving maybe jorge can like put a contrast and will become black i mean you know it's like it seems to me that it's kind of like a a leap in the future you know it's like when uh play a chess players play you know because we already we know each other we more or less we know where you could go where i can go yeah now i just noticed that the trash can on my desktop is is called hiding because i renamed it during the practice but it was called like that before it was a the default name recycled or whatever because i think because you said height and because it's also true that um for the last practices because i know that this desktop will be captured i just arranged the the you know the objects on the desktop to be hidden under the live lab i like this i like these that i mean maybe right now it doesn't mean that much but it's hidden yeah i like this thing of hidden because actually it does we we i mean more heat hype i think in reveal you know when i use the green key is i'm not trying to hide things unconsciously more working towards revealing than to hide things that will be more like a yeah like a masking process or something and i'm more thinking constantly on on revealing and so what if we i mean what if co is a in the brain we do the exercise of height instead of reveal hmm that'll be interesting i didn't really think about hiding and revealing in the practice though i mean it is happening but uh it's not not something that i was consciously thinking because for instance today if i will if i will speak in that regards like when you wear masking yourself then you then then i will say then you hide yourself because it's just the shape of you i don't i don't have your face anymore and as well you were having the shaping green as well and um so that's what i meant like while using the green key it will say like it will reveal uh in the way who i saw it today with you the masking that you were doing were hiding you what was i'm asking so you mean like the one that i was cropping myself and putting something on top or just painting myself green yes yes yes yes both yeah yeah yeah these two these two yeah clearly then i will i will call that in in this thing the language that i'm speaking uh [Music] you were hiding i mean this is what i'm trying to to go with this is because this is just something that we are talking right now is it seems interesting because like this hide things it seems like it comes from a uh a negative connotation right in a way in my head yeah i will think things more like i will think more in in towards i'm showing something you know and i don't know it has to be as well in in a exercise of you know like with the ego and stuff like this what is it but i think i associate the height with something opaque like down okay yeah sorry no no no please well it's interesting that you mentioned that part when i was in front of the green screen and somehow i was painting myself uh like the green color so that it just becomes green i was i was trying to do something like that was the time i was trying to do something with the videos and because we said we're gonna use videos and i was struggling a lot because i didn't know how to play with the videos like i could put video in the background with a green screen and i can be on top of it but this was like it was boring like you know we know what it is and it and then i didn't really do the feedback stuff because i thought it's gonna be really like becomes out of control in a way that it's just becomes a mess and it's not really like interesting mess but it's just a mess and end up with another feedback whatever and but at the end i was really happy with how it came out because it became like kind of like a convolution of you know the feedback and green screen and this mirroring and all these things and windows were moving all over and that was really like i didn't really think about how to use videos but somehow like adding things but like giving room for other not effect but other elements to um to how they say like stand out or to do something right so the feedback is not too strong i mean it was strong at one moment and the movements were not really strong or it can be strong but it still gives room for other elements and that at the end it went really nice that i had multiple windows i was seeing myself sometimes so i've seen here's you sometimes and i was hearing you also hearing your video loop and that really came nicely together at the end and i was really not happy with the the green body part because it was too obvious but maybe it was needed for the last thing to emerge because what i'm thinking now is that wait wait where i where am i i was thinking that yeah so i think we could agree that there are things that they are there there are interesting things like in terms of motion you know when at some point we understood that we wanted to move with the words so we both started like just moving when the words were appearing and that was cool like these kind of things and their different elements they were very interesting yeah that was really fun and i was thinking oh like this is like a bad version of evo dimichev but anyways why he was like he they i don't know that's this kind of um was i i saw like it was not a workshop but some kind of you know lecture performance kind of thingy and it was like demonstrating this um like saying words or just like uh you know yeah like saying words and moving with it yeah and i was like okay like it's like a bad bad copy of that because i was not like i was not completely focusing on the words anyways but so i mean okay so those are like so what i think i was trying to say is that so that we agreed they are interesting elements that's that's that's granted um two things then one thing is to say it um [Music] it takes so it takes so much room still like to setting up until we feel comfortable like um okay this time maybe we took we took it to to chill because we knew we have two hours i don't know but it takes certainly it took me uh like took me like like 45 minutes i guess i could have done it maybe 30 20 i guess if i move um but what i'm what i'm saying is that it certainly takes time until i found myself in in a place where from where i can start playing with the elements it takes time the setting up that's something that yes so that's one thing that i would like to reflect about it and the second thing is that because of the last part we were tired like something that i wish like uh we could um get i guess more experience in that is uh or to have to find more language is that how can we share that we are tired and we want just to drop it and coming back you know without being necessarily you know like there are some things for instance like when i have a question then i just we were at some point when i asked you we were both in a really interesting place right we were like doing something and i said i have a question and and i was a bit laughing but i thought this is part of what we do um and it was okay but that's different than like the last part the last seven minutes 10 minutes i feel that it was i felt already i have nothing to say you know i feel like what i mean how can we share something in that regards you know in whatever direction it needs to go uh because i still think for now because i was question questioning about that now that i still think that we have to we should keep it the timing that we set you know like let's say it is one hour then we stay in one hour recording um i was questioning already today that like maybe we could be more flexible you know but i think for now this thing of time because it's so complex i think it works that we have a set it that we agree um but maybe in time could be nice to think like you know we get so uh flexible and relaxed with things that are happening that we perhaps we can in a way or even say it or just like cut it you know but i think it's a level of complexity because it demands more dissociation of understanding this is it uh to to really like finish i mean not doesn't it okay yeah because i mean for instance like uh sorry to interrupt you okay i just i wanted to so if i if we uh my understanding is like our base is time we share that we start from time because the first thing that we do is like time is and then we have an agreement that it goes from one hour after after one hour we close the the recordings so that's the the base the contract that we have from the beginning is time um so that what i'm saying is that because time i mean at some point in the chat we were talking trying to talk about time time is something that is just it is such a thing um that i think that eventually at some point we can play with that with the time as an element uh but then it will take us time until we can be there i think for now like stick to what we propose as time frame it's fine and then maybe to go back to what i was trying to said is that yeah that in the last minutes i uh that i feel that okay i'm tired how to share that space of being in and out without the need to tell you now to i don't know because even it could be that i tell you like i'm getting tired you know like but just that honestly then we could just do something with that space i think it's really interesting um first of all i think i could like today i thought i could go more so i i knew i was getting tired but i it was like i could go more yes that's true that's that's something i was feeling so um like i feel like whatever you said or did i would take it as a performance so even if you said okay i'm tired let's finish here then i would probably react it in a way that i don't know maybe i repeated some like what you said or like just make it you know like something out of it um this is this is so interesting because actually if i think i mean this for me coming from from my background in dance then it seems very very likely i was i will experience in dance performances you know like then when i'm tired then i get energy from the performer and that's that's amazing because in a way like those things come from embodiment like you know when you are in the space with somebody sharing the sweat you get that from the other person you recycle the energy and that's true because i put it on the text i say like i keep on trying i say that because i was just tiring and then you just like you keep on doing and then at the end it was actually at the at that moment that we start moving more because i was checking constantly the time when i said i keep on trying was about 54 so it means six minutes of movement so i was tiring and i was getting in that atmosphere how can i share that i'm tired um and then you start just doing something and i just go in the loop and then this tiredness became something else yes and i think let's say what if you like logged out um i'm just thinking like how i would react like if i just get out yeah if i close i mean that i mean that's that's what i was trying that's what i was trying to say when i mentioned about the time i think we should not go there because it's very complicated because like something that i could have done because i did it like i went to b one time uh so then is the contract is this it stays for one hour so i can i can let the room i can do whatever i need to do but then we finish the in one hour um yeah it's just like a really random question can we set the timer on obs a timer then that you can see it on the i mean the recording that's one thing but also like i'm pretty sure there's like add-on to you know automatically finish the recording at uh one hour an hour yeah anyways that's just right i'm sure ensure there is something but um yeah like if we cut the practice like you said i think it makes sense like if you just leave the room or you know just just do something else but just keep the recording and keep being online and um what i want to say is like even if you like i don't think you would look out but even if you did i think i would just keep doing it until the like today two hours because it's it's actually interesting to think about it because it's really not about um it's not about doing it together in a sense it is but it's also not how because it's that's really weird to think i mean if we're in the same space then it's doing something together but with this setup i feel it's like it's it's just about myself in a way that somehow we share the space let's say but but ultimately it's it's for myself this two hours is like i do it with you but it's but it's not doing together in a way and and again like maybe that's because you're like just one element yeah like a way but it's true yeah yep i mean i don't take it personally like if if you will say that to me right now i will feel a bit different like now you're just one element right now they're not existing wait give me a second i need to pee yeah so i start my monologue but uh yeah i did this monologue before to to talk about the time because this is something that jorge can't see listen right now but i'm just saying this and record it and it's going to be uploaded somehow and jorge can see it later um but it's not like this moment so he's missing this part of the the discussion um and it's actually but this is also an element in a way because this gap this space that i i i'm enjoying is part of the element especially because jorge is not here that actually its absence is giving birth to another type of element which i'm just making up but i think it's really interesting and uh i hope uh jorge can catch up later when he watches this recording and what else i mean like absence is always like makes me think of a semiconductor because um opposite of electron is the what they call hole which is the missing electron that gives positive um how do you say like not electricity um capacity no i i don't know in english but um okay you're back this is i mean i mean now i think like we are getting i don't know who is doing these kind of things like i don't know like i don't know but we are getting into weird spaces because like it's so weird that we found this normal you know that i just go you keep on talking and then i open the door and then i know that you are talking to me and the video that i will that i can catch up that in the near future and that doesn't matter that i don't need to ask you right now exactly this is getting this i mean we go into so many dimensions so so so yeah and i think i think i said something really important so you have to watch it there is the teacher there's a teaser exactly but you know it the viewers you know it already because you just watched it crazy so i don't know maybe we should like end somewhere around here unless yeah yeah okay wait let me think think so yeah i think one thing that i will say like to look into the future is how to share how to how to be in and out you know like we can do that with questions like that's that's how that's what i mean with in and out like for if i would put an exercise like in dance that i learned from sambrano is that and when you're doing dance let's say if i'm moving then i would all then i go with all the power i go with all the the force that i have and whatever is that that i do then uh the image that he uses is like when you if my intention is going here right with the full uh body embodiment then it's like how can i when i'm here who can i you know somehow like freeze myself like in a cinema like you stop the the movie then you do what you need to do you know you drink water or something whatever then you are like completely normal not in a state of like or whatever or freeze but that you are completely normal and at some point you catch it back from that moment like in a cinema like a for a frame that you go completely with the full energy so and that's an analogy that it works very well like in dance i i have this analogy from cinema how to drop it be normal and catch it right away from where was it so not always but as a composition element it works because then sometimes you can really stop us freeze and sometimes just you stop you drop it keep on talking then just keep on and then you go it gives you more uh composition elements yeah so that's what i was mentioning with the questions we do it because there is a nature intrinsic in the practice that about the questions that's something that already we have developed with without agreements it's like if there is a question we just drop it go to the question go back uh but if it's not the question then there's something that i would that's something that i would like to say like to think into the future how can we share that space i guess we'll see um like one thing just just random thing i came up with is the development was technical development but can we do different kinds of development in terms of like composition or movement or whatever or it is something that we don't need yeah or even no no i completely i think that's this that you said i have it in my head and i couldn't verbalize like usually it's like uh because it could be even just could be a text you know for some reason then we come together and we want to read something you know or you want to show me a video or there is some for some reason there is something that we want to share um and that is still is towards developing the practicing of that mo of that day [Music] yes i will agree completely with you but i guess um we'll do another practice on friday i mean i think friday i'm available but saturday friday whichever is fine or both yeah i think we said friday i mean saturday i think yeah sunday we said and uh i was not sure about friday but i'm open so yeah i put in two years saturday that saturday will work better with me okay then we just do it on saturday and then maybe what we could do is then uh because then as well my day as well is long and then we just met in the morning maybe not at 9 30 but maybe we attend yeah sure and then we see we see how do we want to organize and nothing is nice because already we are getting fluid in these things yeah that's what i want to say cool it's super i mean i'm super motivated like we are getting like so much it's you know what i think is cool is because it seems that is like the the fruit of like one year of work because it will not happen if we will not have been sharing the practices for one year almost you know like now we are like we are super fluid in this thing you know like even with the technical problems and stuff like we are really like it's so fluent the things hope they move like tech always failed and then yeah that's part of the thing tonight and the last time as well in terms of language uh that not necessarily means that you agree with me or i agree with you but yet we can uh go further in whatever that we're doing for instance the last week i was trying to introduce this idea of this that i talked differently all the time of the elements and how to give agency to make them really to take life and then if we if you really think what we were talking about in this chat that it was clearly is that this thing was very much alive to to in in this practice of today now i'm really curious to see one of the first chat like how what were we talking about and did we really have a conversation or not i don't know what we had from the even before best practices but anyways um yeah let's let's wrap up and uh i i don't think maybe we can do that as an exercise if you want is like randomly try to we can try to go and try to find something from the chat that you find funny or interesting or something and then we just can talk like wow we were talking about this then [Music] so many interesting things like i think i i really am really enjoying this space because there's so much uh so much going on it's so much going on it feels very i feel like in the flow like you know like oh yeah this is so cool and it you know it's like as well i feel as i said before like in body in the sense like you recharge uh i feel there is a loop energetic loop uh that i feel that is amazing because you are not here so uh when you said i said i was tired because i was tired and then just you said i could go i could go on for a few hours i mean like more and then i was like wow that's cool you know there's a uh yeah it's a it feels a nice feeling okay so thank you for watching and please subscribe yes because i i have just i think two people in my channel and one of those is myself [Laughter] so for the other person that i don't know who isn't uh yes uh did somebody subscribe to the channel this would be nice or just like yeah like the video don't don't like like do this bye", "KHqVEuFqkWo": "right so this is you reporting now yes it's recording this is the chat this is the chat welcome to our chat we'll see goes in which direction goes yesterday we end up talking about so many things for like an hour yeah so we so just people so just people know that we have apparently this chat as well they have its own life and sometimes becomes backstage by its own um yeah no it's good that we what do you have to say about the chat i don't know it's it becomes like a meta chat about the chat yeah but it was very nice you know like yesterday to be honest like i really enjoyed the conversation with you you know like basically it was a space where i hear you speaking you know from deep you things yeah and then the same time was like space where i could just well spread some things you know like just personal things yeah i think that's nice very nice yeah it's also important because when we do this uh like chat for the chat for the uploading it's you know like we have to choose the words sometimes i mean i know that there are not many names or the names because we don't know we never know where uh if there's like invisible uh guests well at least in zoom now at least in sun we we have this control now is gt was very engines you are sometimes this unexpected guest yeah that's funny anyways yeah uh maybe we can start like like from yeah so i read the this when when you record this interview that uh that you share with me but i share by the way in my my world my facebook well okay cool i think it's officially published this week so i think it's okay okay no no i think it wasn't recorded uh i actually don't remember but in the interview i think i said something about i do something next year so i think it was in december right i think yeah it's been a while actually it was nice i like the i mean the the rest of the things that you were speaking so they were not new to me but i thought it might be interested that summarize for somebody else if you want to check uh kind of the language that we often use in different ways um but i one thing what you said the technology always fails i thought like oh yeah that's nice it's so true and it's so actually so so true that we got used to i remember the first times you know i mean and still because we can see i can see your face of frustration and you can see my face of frustration which happens very often i don't know i think if we use an ai to recognize you know face recognition how often during the time are we putting this phase of like worrying you know or being sad or angry i think will be more than 70 of the time it could be which is very fun but it's very good but at the same time you mentioned like at some point at the end you know when we are like reaching out it's just like whatever and then just be go full on happy dancing and that's always catching up at the end you know like whatever and that's funny how it manifests yeah and the more we we get like frustrated you know this uh dancing becomes more something you know um well i don't i shouldn't say we have to suffer to enjoy dancing but but there is something about it so it's always like super stoic so dramatic by nature like oh my god it's not working the internet is not working but that was basically what happened at node not the internet but like the hubs was really not working as we expected and although we did a stage design yeah because we have this third ghost user to create the stage for us um should we talk about the book or are we done with the book from the i don't know i would like i would like to do you uh to talk uh about this book i mean what you thought you said yeah i would like you to you can do you want to introduce a bit about the background yeah so maybe so it's about this book uh greeting by uh collected by or edited or collected somehow proposed by martin spumber it's called movement research and it's the second part as of uh in yeah towards this uh new dance in a way like uh or new approach or uh on dance it's actually part of like the work the second part of it is called the first one is called dance 2.0 or post is called post dance 2.0 which is the same martin invites people creates some essays and he make a correctorial process where he just put it as a book and this movement research title is also related to that that's thing in is it in new york movement yes in new york but no i don't think so although because for me it was uh tricky as well i don't know actually in terms of appropriations of titles or something because i was searching an internet at some point when i wanted to have this in pdf because i was traveling and i wanted to read something and then i found out that martin has been working sometimes to greet them for them for the movement research in new york so i'm not sure i mean i haven't really like checked the yeah it's there so yeah it's that's the that's the font of the movement research oh yeah so it should be commissioned somehow yeah uh i think it was written in the preface or something i don't know but maybe i it says critics comments attribution editing mara is supported by rurals and this book is supported by the swedish brother might [Music] okay i think it's just all this compile of people organizations among those puffs who uh allow and somehow to make possible the book to become alive and be and what is interesting as well is like this book you cannot buy and it was the same um idea with the dance post dance 2.0 because ideas more like to circulate the books so to move the books around so then you will find it in some spots like in in path we have a lot um and then in other spots like in the impulse dance when they do it or in some some venues you will have some of those books an idea that is just you move the books around right so yeah maybe that uh without like extending that much and then specifically what uh i invite now otto to read was an essay written by daniel uh that's his last name i want to pronounce it well daniel goodbye it's uh it's somebody i won't consider him my friend but somebody that i know from from uh dancing in belgium context um so actually like like you know each other you know what yeah yeah okay um he was the director now he's the current director of like um there is this festival in belgium called called the constant festival uh and then the idea is that that mean in a way that festival in my perception is like maybe they the one big format or the only big format the belgium has since maybe i don't know could be maybe ten years on the state of the art of performances uh because be i mean a part of that now is catching up but i would remember them when i came the first time to the impulse dance which was in 2000 i guess 13. when i came there for the first time i remember that i was shocked maybe 13 14 i was shocked uh to see like the way how people dance uh because for me like i come from uh like the belgium school of dancing or i that i thought that i mean when i came to belgium i have i trained myself under that uh atmosphere which is very uh physical through like they beat sombrano a lot and yeah and which those are more like really physical responses to and this has to be a lot with motion so there's not too much political atmosphere in that uh it's just body wise and which was belgium was famous for it uh in the 90s and 2000 with these companies like ultima [Music] yeah they have different expressions of that what is very body-wise like movement so then when i go to to to the impulse dance thing and then i start seeing this for me i thought like there's no dance you know and i got very conflicted conflicted with that by this thing and then it took me a while i kind of like catching catching up you know like what is this performance thing what does it mean and then i so uh daniel now is the current director since two years ago of this festival that was the only one who kind of allowed belgium to think in that direction yeah and before that he was there is one school uh that addresses i guess systematically trying to see dances more as political framework um or let's say more as an expanded field this book pretty much is it speaks as a dance or see dancing as an expanded field where the body happens sometimes but not always necessarily and then um then there was this there was this uh a school this call from the bosars that is the institution of the arts in like main institution in brussels very well supported um and then they have the school of arts and different fields and one of those careers that you can for following the high institute of arts which is hard and in belgium was is i don't remember exactly but i think it's issac that i think it stands for institute institut superior superior of uh choreography and arts or something like this in french and it was it was it's a studies of uh really into choreography so you go there to you you can study more choreography not dance let's say um and so and danielle was the one who proposed i think he i don't know if he created but i know he was like leading he was a director of that school for a few years and then since two years ago they proposed to him like do you want to take part of this constant festival which was managed by this old person and i mean an old couple couple uh in belgium before you know like and then in this order to try to move things around to give more motion to institutions some more air they call danielle and they so they spread the co-direction of the festival instead of one person in three daniel another two um and yeah so that's the long introduction about daniel and from the context of what what is where where where he comes from where he uh he stands yeah and um so the text was called the movement as a living non-body which was an essay and that i propose now to to to read it and to maybe talk a little bit about it it's funny because i was really surprised that when you said the title of the chapter the movement as a living known body that doesn't didn't really like i couldn't really immediately relate to the content because i know that it is about it but living non-body it sounds really strange alien from the from the content itself i see it's just a random comment but it was i thought it's funny because it didn't really say anything about the movement as living known body because the movement is you know emancipated from the body or whatever but it's not uh well it's living entity itself but if they say living non-body is like denying the body right i mean it is partially denying the body but i think it's the emphasis is not there i feel like you mean the title you mean the title itself is not corresponding to the content it's corresponding but in a slightly different way you know like there's a slight um um how to say offset or discrepancy or whatever because this non-body is really like living known body is like such a strong statement isn't it yeah yeah yeah okay i see why from why you say that yeah i think like and well anyways i didn't really read it thoroughly so i maybe he was actually saying that it's a living non-body but like the the story is it's not about uh anyways i i'm just keep repeating um yeah and i have to say i didn't really enjoy reading it i don't know how it was for you uh i think i mean maybe the the thing is like i have this intro i mean it's not an interview but this always ends up being like me talking a lot about myself with uh when i talk to olivia she's a creator uh and a friend of mine uh a brazilian belgium and she follows up my work since many years and from time to time we catch up and then in a ways like it's such a beautiful exercise for me because then i have to go make sense of what i have been doing and that's what she knows and then sometimes she gives this feedback very concrete about like what might be interested interesting and then as part of one of the remarks when i was talking to her about uh what we do and what i do as well from my final work that is very related to what we do [Music] then she proposed like oh okay because basically i was expressing to her this idea of like that it became clear to me as i expressed it to you in the previous chapter that i i feel that although i was happy with the composition and the flow that we get they were in the flow uh i feel that i i was lacking uh vocabulary to give agency to the elements how i call them to become what they need to become uh well yet i i uh clearly in a way see for myself okay this is happening you know like the elements are becoming alive like i want them i really want to agency them to a fully uh extend and so i was expressing this uh expressing this uh frustration and then she said ah okay you know what what uh maybe this this this chapter of this book and so he was a surprise because he just mentioned that and i told her yeah this book was written here by the way by daniel uh so that's why this that's the context of from where it comes that text so i was reading the text and already i read in the past so this is the second time i read it i have to say the first time i read it i guess i passed through things very fast uh i did it one year ago i guess um i just read it because i know him so i wanted i know i wanted just to to check what he says but now because it was very concrete and i have an intention and well toward towards the text what i was expecting to get out of it it was a nice reading so i did it like slow uh yeah i didn't need to into two takes it's not a really long text but still i did it into takes and it was nice i i mean i enjoyed the text myself uh although yeah they were i mean it's true i guess that at some points the the he doesn't go really deep maybe uh into [Music] um at some point i think he was mentioning no way maybe just like we can just frame the change the the direction maybe you said at some point that you were not sharing some ideas and from a western point of view when you i think you sent me a message you said like that there were something so maybe you can extend uh expanding in this regard will be interesting we can catch from there yeah i um so i don't know like this is just like impression um but basically like what i feel about this is so basically he says there's movement and the body and i think he wants to say that the movement doesn't depend on the body in a way that movement can be in itself which actually is like what martin says actually like similar to the the post dance thing although i think the difference is like martin has really um more um elaborate um examples or metaphors like the the museum which i really like uh you know when when the paintings enjoy themselves the most and that's the when the museums are closed right or the you know the most beautiful paint is in the bucket or something like that like but i think it's a bit um rough or it's a bit too naive in this text like there's something about i'm just like going through muy bridge and uh what's the other one etienne murray i don't know how to pronounce but you know this it's what it's called not stop motion but the the you know this because one that is more don't frame by frame frame by frame or like one is like a you know super imposed overlapping on a single image which i i don't know like this this was really to me to be honest it was really disappointing because it didn't really make sense to me and like also the example of you know like repeating the same movement and then there was a moment that someone else would repeat the same movement exactly which i think is very i don't know how to say it's very naive assumption that uh like we talked to yesterday that um i i don't believe that it's possible to to you know repeat the same movement because the bodies keep changing and you know like others like between like different people of course the body is different so just to how they say um abstracting the movement from the body is really in that sense it's really naive and also uh how do i want to say i forgot but i i feel this is like really from like a western perspective that somehow you know um like human centered and in a way it's it's giving birth to the movement from the perspective of a human and it's not really like the movement doesn't really it's still actually it actually harnesses you know the movement to the the language and um the human through this text and it's not liberating from the body that's what i felt really awkward to read can you repeat that the last sentence that you said oh if i can know that yeah because of you know like how he's framing with the wars um the ideas is actually making the movement more dependent to the human because yeah okay i see yeah i don't know why but uh but that that really felt like the movement cannot be by itself maybe it's liberated liberated from the body but it's still attached to the human perception or human brain or whatever yeah yeah i see what i mean and that was really like i felt it was well i would say it was interesting with the the example of uh uh was it again new zealand um um oh yeah the fantasma fantasma the fantasma thing was called fantasma yeah i'm trying to find it so basically that's like what it's called this practice in investigates the perception of life beyond the human being yeah and that's like i i felt like that's really like you know it's it's really just the surface of the idea that he's trying to catch and they didn't really go deeper which was um like i was disappointed but i was also i thought it's interesting that like how he well i don't know i i would say i i don't want to say how he failed to you know use this reference but well to me it was like a fail and that was interesting how yeah i see that yeah i felt it falling completely yeah but in general i will say that the text is is yeah i feel like it feels incomplete it is weird to have this assumption you know like um so coming from for instance from an indigenous perspective uh which is in a way similar to uh to the in new zealand who they said how they portray i mean they did they they don't separate things right so things are just one thing and actually if you go further even you don't even think like you don't really do like a really rational process of you know trying to get to knowledge that's concrete like in in in indigenous perspective there is not such a research actively trying to achieve knowledge knowledge comes to knowledge is something that it comes to you or not and it's just something that yeah it's uh so the perception is different uh in that sense like uh trying to grasp like one what uh one uh one with as a with a western uh perspective when trying to understand with good spirit you know like because the text for instance or the approach i have been reading about these days this uh book about ub my body for me is a correspondence between jude butler and catherine malibu when they talk about hegel and the phenomenology of the spirit and it's very interesting know how they go and they they really try to put it in the body context and [Music] and it's very interesting because they just they talk very much they give a lot of agency trying to understand how how where is the body in that in that relation what is the what is the body in in hegel's uh work which apparently i didn't know but apparently in a way he doesn't really speak about what is the body he goes a lot about objects but he's not really clear about the body and so that from uh like from from the performance uh perspective it's very uh yeah it's like a curious very it gives a lot of windows that are not being fulfilled from a choreographic or advanced practitioner let's say so they have this text very specific about approaching the body and then what i found i think that's the whole point that i was trying to connect then is that although the intention is very interesting in the way how they try to go through that you know it's true uh trying to understand what he says uh about the body so they do a whole analyze very rational and they try to define the define categories of uh how to define what is my body what is not my body how to multiply in between my conscious consciousness and my body and like a lot of gymnastics of this sense in order to try to understand uh to try to define basically what is something and what is not um then it because of the nature of the analyze and the rationalization of the western perspective it ends taking a position which is very open uh it's fair to say because it still is open the way who they said is yes but no but still it is very it has this approach which is very uh rational um so i i was saying that because it's in relation to what you said like you know from the i don't know when you mention like that that that the texts of daniel feel very uh from a western perspective you know like these assumptions are from uh a western perspective isn't it yeah and especially i'm really sensitive to it um just because uh this is gonna be like a long story with about like politics well it's not really long it's just that um i like how i feel like i was taught in japan is really like westernized um probably because you know after we lost the second world war um i think it really changed and like until recent well i think it really helped for me to do like you know movement practices and like martial arts to you know understand that japan like japanese education is really like influenced by the westernized way of thinking like at one point i really remember in elementary school like the our teacher was asking us like which part of the body like like where uh you have your uh not the heart like like where you feel stuff or you know a few emotions and uh and then she clearly said it's it's in our brain and that was like really like as a you know i don't know how old i was like 10 years old or something and i really felt uncomfortable but you know like the whole society is like trying to think that way that you know we have our brain that's operating ourselves um but i think it's not like that traditionally and also like if i look into you know martial arts um i was practicing uh ikea for some years and that's really about you know um it's about body and mind and yeah that's so but anyways aikido is actually not that old um it only has like 100 years probably like of history but um what i want to say is i mean that's like i think there's like some connection to contemporary dance somatic practices and from that perspective like that that's like my background so when i look at like read text like this then i really feel like how they are feeling their bodies they are like how they're um perceiving the movements bodies yeah yeah yeah yeah i mean this this is something that i have here i guess since always in puff is um but i think what is more interesting is like how can you that should be part of like the symmetry you know like symmetric group there's this group that i follow every two weeks and it's part of the the things in puff trying to understand like asymmetries in general you know how things are working and basically oppression uh towards one group on the other one um because one of the things that i have like coming to uh more uh peace in a way is like of course like because i go and follow this group and i'm the only person who is not white let's say um then is uh then at the beginning i was feeling like wow okay this is just it was a lot in between myself and and he was sometimes like oh you know what i'm doing here but it was a lot of trying to then defining uh many things so it was difficult to not take it personal when you talk about these things in the beginning what i'm trying to share is that in time what i realized it is more important is that how can i in somehow find a way to um as much as possible because it's normal if they're gonna start speaking about i don't know people of color then i will feel is it touches me you know um so but as much as possible then how can instead of getting uh how can i overcome the hurt how can i overcome the hurt from being framed you know or categorized in certain way or speaking certain way and then just try to actually doing the exercise of helping the group because they have the good intention you know what is a good intention over uh um [Music] while still accepting then sometimes i'm just pissed off and then i just express my things and then i do it in the group um yeah i i don't know how to continue i feel like uh we have to run to the backstage [Laughter] okay i mean it depends what you want to say but yeah i mean it's just like very yeah i i i i hear you and um this is like also one of the um yeah let's say i have similar um struggles and uh maybe we can talk about it later because i it's just i just start to um no this is not constructive to say so but but i totally agree with you and uh but it's it's just not is that basic i think it's a very difficult exercise oh i mean i found that it's very difficult for me to not get pissed off when i in a way i feel that there are things they're saying that are not right or even going farther that they have no right to even say it um yeah sorry i i have to stop this now because uh it's it's not really um nice to say it especially when i'm recording but anyways um so going back to the book well we are talking about the book um written by white people not all white people i guess but edited by a white guy okay so what what should we take from this chapter um but i think i don't know it's it's a reference to me um and it's it's good to know like you know this maori people and indigenous people in new zealand like how they you know i mean i i think i need to read a little bit more about them if that's interesting um but yeah um but originally like why did you suggest this book because you thought about like you said something about extrapolating to our practice or like the tech because i thought it was uh i thought it was um i thought in a way maybe i was i couldn't express myself very well when i when i expressed my frustration regards what was happening in the last practice and the last time i mean well while we were doing a thing that was uh good i mean in a way that it fell in the flow um so i think it was in regards to trying to to express part yeah i was saying this to extrapolate part of that because of the way how uh um yeah basically this uh i guess idea trying to give agency to the elements basically i think uh that in a way uh is partly he speaks about that what are the elements the element is anything that it uh that i will have well we do the practice so one element is the internet the other element is my body but maybe the element might be just my hand at a certain point so it's a constant uh um and that's actually it's interesting because it's getting clear from the text that i read about hegel and there's a constantly grouping and ungrouping uh uh yeah constantly a group grouping and ungrouping things uh so sometimes one an element would be my body but sometimes an element might be just my hand and sometimes an element will be uh the windows of vdmx floating around and sometimes an element will be so it's like the constant uh definition uh of what are the elements and the composition of those elements uh life while in the practice um i see um that i think at some point i mean i'm using this word but if you if you go back and chat with because i was doing this exercise and days ago i was mentioning that is what i in the past when i spoke about the constraints i don't know if you remember this at some point as well i know dude i was sometimes trying to say like if i spoke about constraints or limitations in the in the in the same sense how i see the elements what are those elements that i want to know they are for me to play with them um i'm trying to find what i want to say no because this gripping and ungripping was really interesting um in terms of like autistic perception that um we have problems not problem but uh our difficulties that's still still a problem but you know like recognizing object as an object that um it affords um things beyond an object you know like if i don't know what's a good example but like like how how you just you know um when there's a door it's just uh that you label it as a door but it's like you know it's like continues to the walls or the floor and it's just like really arbitrary thing that you say it's a door and it you know you lean on the door or you know you open the door it doesn't really matter you can do whatever you want with it but somehow i think from neurotypical like non autistic point of view you think that as an object and you use it to open or close to you know enter or leave let's say when there's a door but you don't think really about you know leaning on the door or using it in this different way um and that's so that's like one is the function of the object but also like the you know where to separate the object from other things so that's like we're like constantly dealing with the grouping and ungrouping in a way and i was just like thinking about what text um there was something uh written about it so maybe i can send it to you later but um and and actually that's something i was also like before you said it um i thought it's also interesting in general like when we work with the elements because that's really arbitrary elements that we say i mean there's nothing like internet it's just like you know we uh we say that it's a the internet but it's you know just connected network right and what is a network or like we can just go deeper into um things like that and and also like ultimately we can also question what is the body you know like what like what's the boundary of the the body and non-body um if you think you know like let's say my hair is part of my body but if it's cut off then it's you know i don't know if it's still in my body or not so these like little things um well not but it's this little but it's actually really critical and to me it's really interesting to work with the computer because that can be a way to blend ourselves to the the computer or the whatever digital thing called um anything because i see you on the screen but it's it's not you it's just the image of you and when i i i assume that you are there and it's not like you know like a ai generated person which could be possible these days [Music] wait i just i need to be very fast but the toilet is here so yeah i'm gonna just pause okay okay so then um yeah i wanted to to say like that um then in my analyze of things uh i remember then i i think i have shared this already in regards to what we speak about grouping and grouping things it's like something that i guess in a way comes in this idea of like having an ontological process towards the interfaces and like defining what are the interfaces at certain point uh where are not uh so this grouping and ungrouping and related with this idea uh of uh what i like to think about um yeah an ontological process defining constantly what are the inter what are the elements uh what is the nature of the elements uh so it's an ontological process towards the interfaces in one hand and the other thing i wanted to say is this idea of construction and deconstruction of the body which is uh is related yet different uh or more i will say more in depth on the elements this idea of the construction of deconstruction of what we understand as the body is and that happens in the practice and and i think that was one one of the things that i was sharing with olivia is one of the beautiful things that happened from the beginning when we started using hydra and feedbacks when we were like really uh like uh feeling many times the process at some point my hand was lost in some place so it was it was a very nice finding in a really early stage while using feedback with this moving in front of the screen of the construction and deconstruction of the body you know like my body got completely deconstructing the feedback and then you do some you do something and then this glitch is more and then it comes back to me and it becomes super iterative this process yeah yeah and i don't know exactly why you said it but like it's like before uh like i said about yeah i talk with you as uh you know image on the screen or pixels but then we work with you know glitches and you know modifying the images which is really interesting because like this is the only way how i perceive you like through the screen but we're like keep changing it modifying it and it's and it's not just about adding effects that's like these days i really like conscious and really um yeah like aware of like how i describe um hydra because we're not making effects but we can easily see that it's you know adding like visual effects but it's not visual effects um but what is it i don't know what's the good word to it because i think um the original idea of hydra was like video synthesis like analog like videos and this but i think it's for me or like i think it got somewhere beyond or you know like different that and it's not just different it's not just adding effects but then what is this right um and i think this is something new that doesn't exist yet um yeah yeah go ahead no no i was just thinking like wow like this is like something i was i think i have been thinking but i never put into words uh but now i did and i'm really happy that i can finally say that i don't know what hydra is yeah but it's true because i think what it makes it that makes it beautiful is that so the intention of hydra and when you when you read with the with the olivia olivia she described it is an attempt to have like a visual synthesizer right right and um i think because in their context we the the practice starts from the body i mean we want to move then because the body is a political entity then it just already uh at the moment is we start putting the body in the image and then start doing more things like construct and deconstructing these uh it just changes completely it becomes something different uh it gives a different space than just glitching creating bj loops or other uh imaginary yeah totally should we go to the backstage nothing left then just we can say so everything well i'm glad that i can now i have the confusion and we can work on it or not work on it okay thank you thank you for watching i don't know really subscribe like us we like like us please", "Lm-znZUBYkI": "yeah hello hello hello i don't know what to start how do we start usually how do we start this um i was just checking your you recorded and i was uh i was gladly surprised that because of course what you share in live lab is it looks way smaller are what you share in live lab is is your screen one of the one of those windows is your screen it's actually the same because how i did it is i of course i use obs to record and then i also use the virtual cam on obs so it's actually sending the same image to live lab but in live lab it does crop the image so i think that's why you're seeing it just partially yeah because yeah yeah so you because it since the composition is so rich so you use a lot and i mean we lose a lot with that but then now we've seen here i think that's what is interesting of the maybe if we think actually that's a good point actually if you're thinking in a uh in a streaming situation streaming um like live lab is good in terms of kind of like having a neutral combat you know kind of like a you know what where you can have all the sources you know what i mean so i was distracted i was saying that that um um that is first like what you upload and when i send for instance as well is something that i choose consciously of what is my output so it's sometimes it's live lab but basically what i'm doing obviously just have three scenes and because i have two sprints then left is live lap in the center is bdmx and the right one is the output to bdmx and then it obs there's the one who is recording then between left center right depend do i want to record that's the way who i uh but then is my it's a conscious decision of mine what is what i'm recording and i'm saying that because i'm seeing this is your composition and it's so and it's very interesting now uh and in live lab um it doesn't work i mean if we put i guess sometimes i don't know uh but as a composition you know like uh to have like a one output is because sometimes we have eight of these windows so that's a lot uh and a part in each of the if you if you think that in in one of these eight windows you're trying to put this that you're you're doing uh and me you're putting bdmx or something it's just becomes a mess um tiny things yeah yeah like very small yeah um yeah so but i'm thinking the same time that in terms of like live streaming um yeah i don't know we can think about it there we can think actually about uh what actually what is this what is the or what is the live lab actually live love live lab what is live yeah i don't know if uh people are very useful to have these sources no like to have them all of like because it's kind of like the canvas and from the canvas then i can choose what i'm selecting for my position and sometimes i select the canvas itself you know and you do it as well sometimes it's yeah but but i think what i was trying to underline is like it's clear that it's certainly not the composition you know that you are working towards or that i'm working towards live lab is not the composition a lifeline is not no no no it's just a yeah this is actually really interesting topic because also i was thinking about it like what is live lab because uh i don't know if you saw it in the video but at one point i was also like moving the windows that goes next to the live lab so it looks like it's extending live lab which is quite funny and then i was like yeah like live lab as you said the images are cropped and we cannot have you know composition like we can all just highlight one thing or uh change we can we cannot even reorder things um other thing is like i started thinking like it would be super nice if we can select the the source with uh like midi controller or something so like we don't have to go back to the window but we just press button or something and switches the source always super nice yeah um but in the end it's it's not something that they made it made so that it will be the output i think it's just a yeah a controller yeah it seems to me it's more like like uh you know like when you have this television studios then you have all the sources and then from the sources then you will send things yeah yeah i mean i i'm using that and i think you as well like in that way partially then i put all my sources and then with one switcher then i will just click the one that i want yeah but the nice thing is it's through like like i mean there are some ways so you can go around the dimensions of the windows but that's you know but as for instance every time that we put one more window the whole thing has to reorganize and that change the grid so then maybe you have to re repeats all the things so it's not really it's not optimized for doing that i think no but um yeah so so that's something um like because i was playing with the moving around the windows like that was programmed or controlled by the midi controller and at one point i was like as i said they're next to the live lab to extend it or like one window becomes like almost like full screen one of the one of the floating windows yeah so it covers the whole obs uh frame because i i learned i know i knew that um it's going to be a mess like you said it's just too small and too condensed so you don't see it so i just wanted to like because i was not really sharing my hydra window like directly to you so i thought it would be nice to have a full screen but that is actually programmed yeah yeah yeah i see what i mean yeah because like it's true like when uh remember yeah i mean there's i remember because i was uh this time that what we did uh was that we said uh so we prepared we have one hour i think maybe we shouldn't upload the previous one i think this development we should keep for ourselves and maybe we can just publish like the the practice like these ones and but so what we did before is like we use one hour and a half to have like a development time and then after the one hour and a half then we decide okay we take some pause and when we come back from what we composed when the place that we were happy with with things we come back and try to repeat more or less the same framework right that was the kind of like the the score that we said and and i'm seeing your like your windows now and as well i was seeing them they're so rich like old motion and getting that no like that zoom because are very fluid and then you're changing as well the directions very nice and yeah at one point um i really liked the moment when i was not doing anything like well i was just like you know facing back and let the windows move and you you are also like that because it was it was your proposition i mean i i understood that you wanted that and yeah that was good that was a good moment yeah yeah it was nice like i think because we talked about it uh we were more conscious about like moving together yeah it was it was really nice yeah so wait so things that i found it like kind of interesting was like this silence that was good the challenge you proposed was good because it's true when you when you did actually that gesture it was very clear you know like you're saying like okay now i'm stopping you know it's kind of i took as an invitation like if you want to stop moving you know but it was clear like i'm stopping um but so immediately you stop then you then then i understand that actually you're proposing to give focus to the motion to the image emotion um and that was clear i mean like oh okay so this is this is what you want um yeah there was um that was interesting yeah you changed a lot emotions of these things they were very cool because you have control on the on the uh but were you coding that or were you moving there with the midi there weren't any loops no both well i was mostly using the midi controller but i was changing the motion uh time to time with the code yeah yeah yeah because it seems they have they are in loops they're in loops they are in patterns they're very nice very cool [Music] yeah very very very it's a very interesting element this thing the but um then then the problem that it causes me or like with the the challenge with this is um i was thinking that well today when it's difficult to relate let's say first in terms of aesthetics i feel i was happy to well when i finished and everything uh what we did i checked fast like and i knew like i was happy to when the whole like my composition and as well my relation with you so i was happy with the output and then just went back after a walk and then i'm just checking fast yours and it feels really it feels like this feel as a practice in the sense like i was before when i left i remember that i was trying to say to myself i don't want to think i don't want to think in the practice i just wanted to walk to the without very excited now so i just wanted to chill and just walk to the forest helping the house or something but then the first thing that i thought when we finished is like this felt like uh uh as a composition you know start free this is start feeling maybe it was because we kind of rehearsed if you want to say it before and we agree some things like we have this kind of like a set composition kind of thing framework but and apart because we have i mean we are working with the practice for a while so it really felt like this i mean the even the body you know you know even the palette of colors the even the grit the structure it's it really it felt for me that it really looks like uh as a body you know like the two things it felt as a body and that's my impression of of who i uh i was very excited you know i'm still very excited though i think that i really like the experiment it was uh because it gives it give me more freedom because then i don't i don't freak out since since this way of like one hour of development in one of our practice yeah it worked in this case because for is at some point in the second one i thought like oh maybe i should put some hydra you know because already i was and then i put and then i was like okay no don't use the hydra because i didn't use it in the first part and then i thought okay i should just find i i need to find a way how to do something with it um so in a way the limitation it's free it feels like it frees me uh makes me more free i don't get yeah i get less stress uh yeah i don't know how was your experience yeah um yeah i think mostly agree and i think it's good that i didn't have to you know yeah i don't have to stress out myself to do something or look for something else you know i i already have the the toy and i just have to play with it i mean i i still had some time struggling with the code i think i misunderstood something but um yeah but mostly it was was really really really cool and um yeah i don't know what else to say it was just it was easy of course we need more time to do it like we cannot do it like 30 minutes 30 minutes it has to be at least one hour and one hour so we cannot do it like every week but it's a nice format if we want to yeah i think because i mean what i felt is like something you know if if uh for instance if there is occasion when somebody's asking us like to do something like this it really feels like more responsible in a way you know because it still is like is still it goes the spirit of the practice you know it's not a set you know it's not the reset of we are not choosing a song or something uh it's not said so it still is in the spiritual practice but certainly it feels like it has a body it has something that so it's it's a language that yeah i feel like that's the word that i found it that it has a body uh cohesion yeah another thing that i was thinking always so yeah sorry i don't know i just just add like i i felt it was really grounded and i think it's because we didn't have to you know develop further in the second session so we we just yeah the body was there and we just do it and it's like no like no distraction um yeah you i'm i'm watching you with your before yours like and it looks chill you know and it's weird because i mean it's very interesting because it's i mean i'm counting here just in live lab we have seven windows and a part of this you have three floating and the clock behind i mean it has a lot of information and although with this it feels chill so that's amazing i'm very happy with the there's text there's a lot of different colors and the the and it's one of those like also another thing uh i should mention is because i made the control i can also clear the windows and see your screen and i think in the practice i never really looked at your like whole bunch of screens before it's always through my hydra like getting your feet and see it in my hydra with different effects and i rarely see the original ones and i never see the whole views on live lab but today i did i just had time to just observe and that's just super nice yeah i was thinking that there is i mean it seems to me that we have this you know like so it's like the way i perceive like i feel like so we have some some body somehow and and the body there are objects and these objects are they ask i mean i'm talking about the object including your body typically like your physical body my physical body the floating windows like all the elements they are in in in place and i'm thinking that this this body uh with all these elements and um there's all this interface all these things inside each of them they they have a different life so i see them like the independent entities that deserve different treatments and it's like a i thought it's like as a small society or something with all these bunch of elements uh the each of them they have life and different constraints and then sometimes if we have ten of ten elements maybe three are really good and then we like to do something just the three of them and the rest have to chill out you know and then something maybe uh all of them they want to do something maybe just two sometimes i mean i start seeing i i start seeing uh this a bit like that um like how to say like not i think i'm start seeing that all the elements i'm they are equally precious uh and they have each each of them they have its own life so the each of the windows that you have each of the things that we are doing it has a proper life in regards to the practice then it's just a matter of listening actually uh of you and me to really listen actually to the elements you know what is neat what can i do to let this group take the shape that they need to take and that i found hard because this is a problem of of listening um so that's what i was trying to say like when i was doing that and i wasn't my thing you know i was free i was feeling very free happy dancing like very chill and still i was trying to then in a bit i guess on uh not formally going into this perspective that i was just mentioning the thinking with the the multiple elements and the body you know uh all these things that i just mentioned and i was feeling the i don't know like uh yeah i guess i was feeling that um that i don't have the experience basically it's like it's like when you want to read a book but yeah or you want to know about the subject but you haven't you don't have too much experience let's say if when you want to learn a new language so you can speak a little bit of the language but you need to learn more to be able to express yourself in the language that's the way how i feel when i was doing that because i feel like okay this is actually cool like you're cool i'm cool like we are like clearly connected i mean we are in the in the zone we are on in the flow but it felt but i can recognize that there is a lack of practice in a way you know there's a lack of practice on that zone and that's the way i perceive it from my side um yeah i don't know if you understand what i'm saying well i'm trying to catch and relate to what i've been thinking um and then i forgot what i want to say no but um i think it really to me this window the let's say floating windows they really changed the workflow and perception and everything because i think i mean the reason why i started is like i just want to add something but and it did add another layer to our practice but at the same time as you said like it kind of made me to listen or it yeah it just opened the awareness to what you're doing what the the whole screen space can do what i'm doing with regard to the screen space and this is nice it's not like like last time when i tried with the the vr controller and i have like you know different controls but that's just like at on top of you know whatever visual thing i'm creating and it's not really like revealing anything but this window thing is just trying to yeah like open up or reveal something that we've been i or at least i was not aware of or i thought i'm aware of your windows but i was not so much or i found a different way to see it interact with it and i'm not really like using your screens in a different way i was just i was just looking at it which is but that is still i don't know what it added to me but it did add something oh at least yeah because i i react to you more obviously like this time it was more than the past practices that we looked at each other yeah i mean but i think i i i dare to say like in my perspective like one thing to say the two things about this uh thing with the with the floating windows is one thing is that they're not disturbing so it felt like in a way because if you introduce a new element and and this is not it's not working we both will feel it and then there is a dissonance you know like we somehow we will express it like yeah there's there is something not working but this thing was this moody smoothly um working so it doesn't feel like as an added element it feels as something that yeah that in a way yeah it's like for instance because i work the whole thing that this in a way it seems to me that because you mention it at some point there was a bdmx i have all these floating windows but i i i work when i do these gestures with the macbook they move but i'm not planning to move them it's just that they float in a certain way um but what a cool is like that you you have this thing in your head i don't have it because i work with this thing but uh you you can see them and sometimes you say like i schooled it sometimes then you work like this and um yeah that perception of those floating windows i didn't have it and what did i want to say yeah i mean just just add to or like reflect on what you said yeah because it's it is definitely a new thing but it's not like a new in a way it's not a new function because we always see the windows and it's just you can move it around it's just automatic and yeah yeah the other thing was like you said it's it's another i don't know if it's a society or let's say organism or something that just you know does it does what it does on the screen and like i was you know facing back like i could not well i could stay still but something still happens and it it's nice like i always try to make some kind of you know um not emotion but some kind of um not a trans transition but some something happening on the screen with hydra but that's maybe it's just becomes a bit predictable to me or it feels you know it's it's happening in the window so it's not like kind of drastic change but as soon as the windows start to move it's something that really i don't know it's it's somehow embodied in a way maybe i don't know how to say it but it's it's something that really feels human feels something is happening and even if it's just like rotating it's it you can keep watch keep watching it i don't know yeah no but the thing is i think that yeah the second thing that i forgot to say about the windows was that it's like the thing is well they work because they are i mean that if you think in dance then like and as a choreographic practice then there's the body on the space and then you and then or the elements in the space and then with certain things right but then our space here is the screen right and then the thing is that those elements they're moving with certain uh elegance because of the because of the i mean they look they're fluid you know it's not like when you drag a window you know that's this that's right that's rough you know but these things are loop or are they are hooked to the midi controller so they have a certain elegance uh that is very similar if you will in a way the whole series like when you put dancers and but they are just with this uh point of view uh like eagle i know like it's it's like um you know like when the camera is above uh and then the dancers are dancing around like the windows are certainly moving in the space as as as dancers will do if the camera will be on top looking at them that's what so i was that's one of the things that i wanted to say that i think they work pretty much because they have this elegance in motion and and if we if in a way we are working towards digital dancing or something around the motion is in there and this thing has they have each of the windows they have their own uh videos and images but first like they go in kind of same palette so they're not really like i'm seeing right now the videos when you change the the huge saturation they change together so they are in the same palette so they are not disturbing and at the same time they have this elegance of motion um so it's very dancing you know it's very choreographic yeah i don't know what to add um i was just thinking um i wouldn't do it but it would be funny to see uh this uh piece from william forsyth that the the dancers move the tables if every table is uh the windows and if they interact with each other you know like the visualization version that they created that uh the dancers like there's like not ar but special effects that comes out of the dancer and you know triggers other stuff it would be funny if that happens with the little windows that you know triggers another event to the another window and starts moving anyways um yeah i mean i mean but this is certainly interesting you know like the the because this is the way it goes close to a correctorial process if you want to say it of a stage design or whatever you want to call it no but definitely that's the idea behind it yeah yeah i think yeah no um [Music] and um what that was trying to say was it that he just basically consciously so consciously moving elements on the space uh and since the sp since the screen is the canvas since trying to do the analogy with dance so because we want to in a way to dance so since the screen is the dancing space then the elements that move there as elements you know like those windows are elements uh let's say live love is one chunk you know it's kind of like one big object but these are clearly not abstractions no like these are clearly separate elements you know like the the windows the other windows that you have there with the the timer um yeah so those are like elements that clearly take certain dimension in the canvas i don't know how you feel how how did you feel the relation because it looks good you know but i don't know how you feel i just could share my my experience towards my composition uh so i was happy from the things that i did and but then at some point then i was feeling okay kind of like i was feeling that this thing is alive it's happening you know like life is happening now so the element so the elements are alive i'm part of this but then i was feeling this thing that i shared you know i feel that i would like to be more alive you know i would like to be more i would like to understand you guys but i don't know what i cannot yet speak that language that's the way i perceive the the thing so i don't know how was for you your experience because this has to be in terms of your experience not the composition but how was your experience in relation with what was happening that's a difficult question i don't know because well when i was doing it what did i think i'm just thinking um but i feel i didn't really think about what you said like it's just like to be honest i was not really thinking too much when i was doing it i was just thinking it's good you know like it's it's good so i should just keep doing it that's it and like there are there are reasons why it's good like we talked right now um but i didn't really think too much maybe i was thinking like because you're in this one window and it's also nice that i didn't oh well i did a bit but it was not like clearly like overlaying us on top of each other like the video of you on top of me or a bit of me on top of you i was not doing i was doing maybe at one point but that was not the um idea but these windows were just like like representing myself or you or the text editor and it was not blending things but somehow they are living on the screen together which kind of that dance analogy um like they are kind of dancing together on the screen [Music] yet yet because now i'm watching so your video like things like those windows i think so we but i think we both agree i think if anybody's like watching this like i think we haven't given so much compliments so we both like read that they work uh but i think they won't they will not be working if you just keep on doing them uh but what i'm seeing in your composition is that they work because it's not that you keep on moving all the time then as as you said before because i'm just watching what we talked then there was this moment that you make just one of them and then just you work with one you know so it's very similar to a choreographic work in the sense like you have like a group of dancers and now now one is doing a solo and then the focusing is that in that one or now there is this thing when the two come um yeah yeah yeah i don't know why i don't know why how well but actually that one thing uh the the one full screen thing was more practical reason that i just wanted to make it full screen so that you can see it basically and then playing with your hand try with the second screen that appear in your own screen because there was your like at some at some point i think the the window was catching until here let's say so part of your hand was just in the next uh frame that it was in the same window so in a way you were playing something with that it just so it's just a detail you were just like playing with them the construction of your body okay yeah i i didn't do it but it will be i thought it would be funny like if i show like different body parts with the different windows but i think there's someone already did it um with the kinect that shows like window like that only shows the face and only shows the hands or legs and with like separate windows and they're tracking the body so it moves as you move i think there was someone who did it to this i've seen it somewhere but i think it's really different that's really technically oriented work that kind of makes a joke it's just a joke that you know you can use the body tracking and show it with different representation in that case it's a window but for me it was totally different um concept or intention to use the windows because that was not just like to relate or it's not like just making a joke but it's like it's i don't know i'm missing the word or maybe i don't have an intention i don't know i it's it it felt really natural and clear to me but right now i'm just losing words yeah it was cool it was very it was cool um okay maybe we can close the chat here and then we just talk uh yeah and i think it as we like i think i will experiment with this for the next few times at least and then probably like gradually we'll theorize theorize the windows the floating windows yeah as well like the yeah is yeah i have my own i mean it's because i'm actively trying to understand what is because i'm i'm relating this with my masterpieces uh so so that's what i'm like i'm in the active exercise of like trying to find like doing an ontological understanding of [Music] partly this process actually um so i'm actively doing that man [Music] yeah so but cool maybe we can close the the chat and we talk backstage to our range yes so thank you for watching please subscribe and press the good button bye", "60pY5i9ABFw": "chord yep good so what's up what's up um so what's up yeah what's up so what are we aiming for or what we are not we're not or where are we aiming for maybe what are we not aiming for will be easier or i don't know [Music] i think yeah so maybe i think what wait let me think yeah i would propose then somehow that we take some time that you prepare some setup in some time that we said then prepare some setup i actually could be interested in this that um we take we define some time and then we prepare some setup or something that we want to try and then we do one practice one hour and then after i think then maybe we can talk and maybe we do it again or i don't know i will propose that that we take some time we prepare something and then we just we write that we just jump into the in the practice i don't know if this is a question it's not a proposal uh should we stick to that one hour practice or we blend the work like prepare preparation and practice that's interesting no yeah you know what let's let's let's assume that the prepara the preparation is part of the practice that's uh so because that's what i do actually in my practice when we do together then sometimes because i'm late then i then i part of my the setting up is part of the practice so i would say could be interesting yeah so then just be uh just we i guess yeah but then so record and then i will start recording as well my we know paid weight because then we will then i will set then we need two hours then a practice of two hours makes sense because we will rain running like from now i mean or we can say like 30 minutes just to set up or we can say that that's part of the practice no i think we could go for two hours like two from now yeah and then i will be recording my my my at least one composition that i will share with you to upload to be uploaded yep that makes sense i think grandioso so i do 35 ah it is not nice that is not sharp at the time i know yeah let's count two hours so it's um so 2 35 three four four four forty five four thirty five we finish we close the recording i'm sorry recording this okay four let's should we switch to live left then uh i think will be easier as well yeah yeah true right yeah so let's keep the slide up as the zoom so zoom connection right yeah okay so i'm gonna yeah let's switch there and it's already 2 36 but let's say we do it until 4 30 45 yeah sure great and see you in live lab yep", "0q3zOgH5V44": "great hello everyone are you recording yes it's already recording okay hello everyone hello everyone thanks for watching please subscribe don't forget to give tons thumbs up exactly if you don't like it it's so funny like since i i well i think i said this before but since i posted the hydra tutorials about quite a lot of subscribers yeah but i think i think i have like 200 right now and i i still need like 800 to monetize my channel so it's a long way to go how many how many you do you need to monetize that a thousand and then also you need there are like some other conditions but one of them is that you have to have 1000 subscribers i think i think i have three subscribers and one is myself i don't know who are i was trying to see actually who were they and i could not find it no but i think you get notification if someone subscribes to the channel so you have to just see this history and if it's just three people it's not so hard to find them out so how are you um feeling better like well i can show you like look how nice how beautiful it looks like now my room i'm proud of my so this you saw like the but look my mess is gone oh wow so then i have all this this space you see like i really clean all this so everything i put it here in this corner and then i put my bed here normally it was the other way around my bed was there and that room and so yeah i have a lot to i mean i have like almost twice the space that normally i have when i'm doing the practice at my house i see it's really good yeah i i had supper and i feel more calm i would say [Music] but um yeah i was it was quite intense today i feel yeah like i mean for me that was i really when you said to me like yeah but it's like we it's like in 10 minutes is finished i was like what i thought we still have like at least i don't know yeah 40 minutes to go yeah i think it really like the the flow of time is so different because of where you are yeah yeah certainly in this in this place as well because it's so big if i just go to have a coffee it take me i mean it's not it's not that it takes me so much in the moving still there but on the on the way something might happen you know and that's what it might like for instance yeah different things so the perception of time is is different right yeah i can totally understand and then you went outside to snack and of course that to the connection yeah that was quite a that was something but that was i mean i was very happy actually that uh when i called you was actually to think true because i couldn't i i was blocked i guess on my on how to solve it you know myself and then if you will i mean what you proposed was very simple you know like maybe just like myself i put it in my composition and then of course you don't have the problem that i have with the ips like but i mean what i'm saying is that is is in relation to what just we thought uh talked before today this is like if i'm working alone i will just get in my own mess you know like just trying to do something more complicated yeah uh yeah so i was like when you said that i thought like oh yeah hello yeah you know obviously you think i was even thinking like yeah but maybe i can create a virtual vpn and then just extend it and then just have my router as well with me i mean i was just trying to go full on like yeah yeah no but that happens to me as well sometimes and but i think i kind of got like over that kind of you know mentality like at some point because like i used to think really um in a way that i have to solve things in a technical way like a clean way to fix things and then i don't know since when but like i think because of like experience of or coming back to commercial projects but they're not just commercial projects but like if you work with someone and you have deadlines and then you cannot just stick to the clean solution you have to fix something quick and something that works and then like you know it's always you know this um challenge that you have to yeah come up with something and like i think now i'm really good at it yeah so when you have problem with the video you know like let's just use facebook or like this is like like also that happened you know last summer and that was really fun that you were like connecting from facebook and i was using that video feed yeah but i mean i have to say that because what we did like is if is that no wait we agree normally so the practice we have with one hour and we are quite strict in one hour and then i said this time okay let's do two hours and then we didn't exceed actually nothing more than just two hours in between those two hours we took us well we consider the time of setting up i guess it was different for me because i just have all that mess that you could see so um [Music] but it's so we anyway we consider that and i don't know how was that for you because yeah yeah um let me let me finish but uh so because uh at home i take in consideration often my my setting up in the in the performance and i don't i don't know if you have done that before um it depends like i try to set up things that has to be done before starting the recording because you know some preparations like especially with audio because always like if i screw up something then doesn't play anything or something um but i usually try not to prepare much because that's not you know that's not the practice you know like the idea of the practice is that you do it on the spot and it's not like you know you have some everything prepared and you just have to play something when you know it hits 9 00 pm or something so it's like i don't do it that way i try to build up during the one hour but today i was i have to say i was completely um unprepared and in which sense everything and everything like because the last time we did this together when was it the practice yeah i think that was the second streaming we did so we did the streaming on my birthday and then we did again right the week after so when was your birthday 24th of what january january and then we and then we did a streaming after yeah like end of january or beginning of february something so it's been a while actually almost one month sure yeah yeah but like for me when i was like when i put hydra finally i was like how do i execute the code yeah that's that was so funny because like i i felt like like when i did i i said it loud but when i saw the chroma key and put the you know the hydra thing i was like wow this is this looks so funny like we are doing this like every week um but let me let me let's just go back to your question so i was not prepared technically so i had to like start it when we started and i totally didn't think about what to do like technically like i didn't have anything to you know explore um and just like i thought okay maybe i use the mini controller just because i bought it and i haven't used it much so that's like a good excuse and then i was like okay this tracking thing is the controller thing like last time i tried and you know that was i have to say that that was  like that was um interesting gadget but the one that you use in the you use that in the live streaming right i think so yeah like with you know the the vr controller thing and yeah yeah i was like it's just like it's cool but i i just feel so overwhelmed to set this up and like constantly i have to be aware like okay something can break or you know like if something happens i have to fix this part and that's just it's just not healthy to you know work with it so i was like okay and and in the end i was not really happy with what it does so i did i didn't want to do it and then i thought oh yeah then i thought okay maybe like a few days ago like someone was doing this weird window thingy uh he posted on twitter and i was like the one that you were doing yeah yeah so i saw it before and then i was like i i tried it by myself it was fun yeah i want to know how you do that yeah yeah i i still need to kind of establish the way to do it javascript script or what what is what kind of is it javascript it's javascript yeah but how it grabs your local windows i don't get that yeah anyway but i think maybe there's another point of this right now yeah well if i just say it in one line you know like this pop-up window that is so annoying when you visit the website and like something shows up ah so it's not it's not actually your the windows of your uh finder uh it's not the there's not the machine folders no like so like if you make a pop-up window you can actually control that window from the uh like what uh open that window so that's how like i was like connecting them and it was so funny okay um yeah it just turned out to be so nice because like one is just it's just funny and the second thing is just it's it's because like these days i was not really willing to write hydra and i was like like today like before starting i was like i don't know like i really don't want to do it maybe i use p5 js or something else to explore visuals and um but then i started with hydra and they're like no i don't want to do this and then i started that window thing and that that just totally changed it because then it's just pure javascript and writing but it's weird is because still i felt it for instance if you will have if you'll be using p5 if you're using some processing sketching then i will i think i will i will recognize it um so what i'm trying to say is like i don't know what you were doing this weird stuff like with my uh with the with the windows and um so first i was very distract so i was i i was not watching too often because i was just moving around uh and it's just from time to time i was i watch and then i see like these floating things um but it's still they were it they failed i mean i just saw the whole composition i'm talking about live lab and my my composition so i guess it's the same from what you're seeing something similar in light blob um and then it felt that it was practice so i guess you were using hydra uh because it felt it didn't feel different like the the visuals that i was getting they felt some somewhat in the in the theme i mean somewhat something that is it was not so different you know what i mean if you will have using a sketch of processing i will i will i would perceive that yeah yeah yeah yeah but that's why that's why i like i also enjoyed it because it kind of like just went together that's it these votes together yeah it's it was funny like it was just like something natural i mean i had two hours so i i have to say i could do much more than that i think but still like it was nice to like also like we didn't have to rush too much i mean at the end yes but we danced we have two hours but it was really fun the last part was really cool yeah yeah and that also like felt like okay yeah this is a practice you know like that feeling that i think i i was i was missing it for some time yeah yeah you know so this was like overall it was really nice yeah i'm wondering like um so one thing that i will say that i like from from the from what we did is i don't know it was because there was two hours so it felt that we have a lot of time but we talk often you know we could talk um and that was nice the but again i i think it's when because you have two hours i don't know maybe so i guess my reflection is in terms of time like the time the the the the two hours that we proposed yeah like to me it was like um i think it was good that we had this briefing like before we start we talked about you know how we do it basically and we just confirm that it's a practice that we do it for two hours and then it really made me think that like like in the like at some point like uh in the in the practice like one hour practice i i started to like um like not talk too much and you know like try to be like really present and do what i want yeah but then like that's i mean practice can be bad but like that's not the like you know practice can be like other in done you know other ways and how we did it today is really like i was really conscious that yeah like we have two hours we can talk that's also part of practice you know like we can you know just talk about what do ideas or troubleshooting and that's totally fine and that's how we started actually and that was also two hours like when we started like like when i started the the race i had that's just that's true it was two hours and actually that feels that felt short sometimes to me because i was struggling back then a lot catching up with many things that you knew that i didn't knew yet uh and for me that felt short sometimes yeah so one thing that i have to say actually in relation to this that you said this is the first time that i felt you completely like felt like you were like if you smoke weed or something like you were really really really chill like almost like sometimes when you were thinking you were doing you were smiling a lot like for instance because i met you in note in germany i know where you're getting to s into your instincts you know and you start like kind of like doing some noises already if i will not know you before i just i would think that you are just struggling like you know like there is something not going no good but because i met you and then i share space with you then i know it's just the way how you get into it something um so it's the first time that you were not doing something like that you see that's interesting i mean it's the first time that i recall like you were even singing like you were like quite relaxed really relaxed actually yeah i mean to me i was i felt i was lazy in a way that i didn't do much but uh yeah but but thanks for saying that because it's it's really it's really um i i don't know it's a good thing or bad thing i mean it's probably good that you know have i think you know i think like sorry to interrupt you i think i mean the way i see it is that in relation to what we do it was so cool because i was just i mean i have way too much here and stuff so i was really stressed out and you constantly like you or you literally you say some things and then when i was asking you were constantly different ways telling like telling me like to chill to chill out you know to relax so i tell you i call you like in 10 minutes you know i was trying to be exact and precise and you were like yes okay but chill and so and that was very good like it felt very uh generous in one hand but at the same time i think more what i think is more relevant isn't more as a duet in terms of like as a performance it was so supportive you know like it was very supportive um in a meta level if you know what i mean yeah yeah i think well i don't know why but i understand and like today i was really really chill like i had like you know space i mean like yeah like i was not like pressure i was not stressed maybe because of the situation right now for me like i finished some some important things and you know yeah um i had some time and that probably that's one thing but also i don't know maybe because it got a little bit warmer um or yeah but but today it was really really nice and the the other thing that relevant is um like while while we are away like i had like two workshops i gave uh once with floor and um another one like last week uh that was by myself and that was both and the second one was processing no no they're both the same content with hydra i mean that was for processing uh event but uh i gave a hydro workshop and that really yeah made me like i don't know like how to say like not confident i'm i am confident already but um it's it's more like you know i don't have to like put too much to make it good like i just have to be chill sometimes and like don't stress out myself too much um yeah so that probably affected to some extent um yeah like i don't have to like prepare a lot or oh i did prepare a lot but like i don't have to worry you know like what so like how many things i have to say or you know like am i missing something or right i can just improvise and you know if i improvise and if i fail that's also okay and because whatever i do is fine yeah and that really yeah i think that really helped me to be more relaxed yeah actually i think i don't have too much to say more but i actually what i would like this that we try something i don't know if you have time tomorrow um so maybe we can stop the recording and then we talk sure then uh this time really please subscribe and uh press the good button and whatever i don't know one put one like put these ones put these ones together anyways uh see you i don't know when but i'll stop recording", "f2FAmFAXbkY": "record okay hello so hey everyone and what just happened i'm i'm a bit creative to be honest like i mean i'm not i'm not yeah that's my feeling a bit i feel a bit like acting i think it's anything in english you know when you're a bit like [Music] i like it i don't know how to express myself okay i don't know if you if you can help me with what i'm just uh how how would you express how you feel um contemporary dance after workshop how do you feel about your body about your sensation um well i think first of all i have to say i was quite tired because um i had really late night interview yesterday what time was your interview uh i mean german time 3 30 german time 2 30 but yeah wow i mean that's not the time to have an interview you know so and i i didn't sleep that long because uh i just wanted to finish some stuff this morning i mean housekeeping stuff so i i took a nap but i i think i just need to uh sleep i i know that i didn't quote much today like i i did but it's like you know i was coding a lot and then started moving and also so the other the second thing i want to say is uh it was really techie for what i did it was fun it was fun yeah but i was like i i think you know i was just playing with the toy yeah i mean i think i mean what i'm thinking more is let me let me find my my text yeah because i don't want to lose one zero two zero uh four no five is that i have two i guess two main things to say one is that i i like this as experiments you know like these places that we as experiments and in the other hand i i think it's important for the practice of to not completely lose that that framework yeah because is it that one that we um i don't know it doesn't does i think in a in a rough way that's the two main things that i consider because in a way i see this one as more experimental so in a way we can try to propose that more as a choreographic space in a way where you can actually really not always but let's say for some occasion we or together or a part we almost kind of i can see myself thinking more choreographically actually speaking of on the elements that are happening and yeah so more as an experimental space that in a way more conscious although let me try to explain better so in a way or either so conscious of that um yeah of what we do even though let's say it gets messy you know but that there is this consciousness uh yeah in a way if we want to going back to this idea of binary in a way like i feel that in the practice i think what makes it nice is we try to to elude to stay in a place we try to move uh between spaces but um but it i think they don't seem so forced uh already uh in in in the practice that's how i feel but when we come to these spaces because there are new spaces it seems that we are uh challenging like battling like you know like kind of like there's some uh friction between the mediums the tools and the yeah there's so much happening right so much happening yeah yeah that's what that's uh where i am right now i think okay well i don't know if i got it completely but um just reflecting on what we did today well i don't know if experimental is the right word but like we tend to forget that the let's say that the regular uh routine or the you know regular practice how we do is already like technically really really you know complicated setup right it's it's not easy and then we're you know trying to add like for example the streaming we try to add and that of course cause causes more problems and today i was trying with a controller and uh you are also trying with different multiple computers phone so that's like you know yeah of course it's it's just technically demanding and then you know you have to be really conscious about the setup have to you know troubleshoot all the time which like one hour or or that's all that's what i was trying maybe to express that because it's okay if we are in that space you know that we we said okay today is gonna be like this but that we are conscious that is going to happen you know that we are going to be just like that you know because that's i think that's what i wanted to say that i i think that experience um i think we should find this the space to to do both things like to to do more like a practice where is more best practices actually like as a practice and the other one i will say there is more a performative space you know like really performative uh performatic if you want to call it let's say from streaming in a way could be that we can decide like from streaming and there you know from streaming and their uh at their own all yeah different layers um sorry i i don't completely get like what you mean but how you distinguish the best practices and the performance performance yeah so maybe let me try to um see it so i see that the practice let me see what is not the practice what what i think is not the practice or maybe i i feel i don't feel yet comfortable to to be part of the practice is i think anything that we anything that we are not used to i guess in a way yeah i don't know his part could be part of the fears of being new spaces i don't know you know like part of the fears of being uncomfortable even though i was not uncomfortable i i don't know of you it was fun you know it was nice i was not suffering but it just gave me this feeling that it's a different space it comes from the practices but it seems uh for me that because there is so much thing happening that i i think i would like to approach that space is more conscious more conscious of of the constraints of the space um you see it's more delicate and it's more i don't know you need to care a lot you know yeah in a way yeah even though because it doesn't mean that we have to do the things in a certain way you know that we need to find a mechanism that is perfect and it works but as more it i think how i see it is more i would like to feel that there is some consciousness of what are we going to encounter for instance if i compare because i don't have so much experience streaming so this is the second time that i'm streaming with you and the first time my obs camera was not even working but then the first time that we did it i we got this thing of the feedback for instance so it was like kind of like an open mind like like a entering a new world like boom and this could happen like this um so and this is the second occasion so i start seeing more things you know um so i think what i'm the way i kind of do an analogy i think is similar from what i said the last time is with drugs and psychedelics in the sense that it just opened a gate that it goes in any direction you know like uh it can be i feel it's so psychedelic that if i just stay with you in just one of the windows and just keep on playing on the feedback i kind of stay just there and just go you know go crazy um because it's there's so much happening um yeah but i think i think that's really uh interesting analogy because i was thinking like i think that's true to some extent but i think we're already drug addicts so you know we i don't know if we can you know just continue doing the same thing you know it's it's fun but when we want something else i mean something more than just doing feedback for example and i think it's the important thing is like it's just that um we you know we experience something already and we cannot like it's it's different from when we started so we already have like different expectations something okay i think a part of this because i think i want to say two things one is this is this it will be a topic i think already this is i i see this is kind of uh i don't know i just put in my notes it's like a this is this is more yeah this is a live stream situation because actually we live stream so live stream um so this is something that i guess we will be dealing with in that space and we will get i guess worse we will get worse in doing that um hopefully and but what i wanted to say as a uh i'm trying to say is that this live stream space is gonna be a new topic we can go i mean this is just something we are just starting opening the door particularly speaking more practical you know in a more high level today for instance you were using this tracking and there was something very interesting that is the first time that you were doing that sometimes i tried because i have some much my setup many times i always am putting more things that i can control but so but this time you you because you have the tracker you have the motion of the camera the of the frame in in a way so i remember the last time we were talking a bit of that in the in the last conversation there is i was using my phone to give the example that it's so different when you move like if i move like this then if i start moving my computer because as an audience is is so aggressive or let me change that word it's so appealing in a way is so i cannot escape if i have let's say three or six blocks or six screens that i'm seeing let's say live lab it's very difficult for me to escape that one because it's just changing the very dimension of where the things are happening um and this is something that uh was one of the first times that i remember that you were doing something like that drastic because even at some point you said like even i don't have to move you said to yourself you said like i'm not moving that much because you were controlling this and i remember i didn't say anything because i was wasn't my thing but i it it stays in my head like yeah yeah i don't know how was your experience with this i mean that's like what you said is totally the reason why i started doing this you know like because i i knew that if i start moving then i need something to you know to move the frames for example so that like i'm not just playing like close to the camera and doing something so it's not like it's not a random thing that happened but i i really consciously took decisions to you know use the controller to move the frame and like not they're not tracking but it's you know i was following myself um but i well i but i have to say it's still the same because even if i'm here i have to be like looking at the screen and moving the um the controller which is almost same as you know working like close to the camera because i'm really like conscious about what's happening there and playing with it so i have a distance but basically like mentally it's the same it's not like i'm moving a lot and uh using the space so i don't know if that was like it was interesting effect but it like it didn't really uh work as i expected it was not my intention yeah i see what i mean yeah yeah i have this idea um this concept in my head uh of revealing um i'm part of like temporality this is part of one of the things that i'm busy with right now am i developing for work in my work and then that's why i was trying to use different cameras and i bought these different gears because i'm trying to use like then um yeah different perspectives and that basically trying to play with time and space you know like how i can decompose one full image and then just uh yeah just play with that those aspects of my body but i'm saying that because in relation so then i was having this point of view camera here hanging and so the intention was revealing you know like what i'm doing in a first person like exposing what i'm doing what i'm seeing like sharing what i'm seeing but it's true like the it didn't work how i i thought before who i felt when i was playing before like some hours before in the framework that we were doing you know in the practice it didn't fail how excited i felt and i thought it might work in the practice if you see what's seen like before because before today i was playing a bit with this i make some videos and then i thought ah this is super cool i will try to use it today but then really on the spot it didn't feel it's not the thing what was the your what was your expectation to give more insight like i don't know my expectation was like to give to expose in a way in a way like what you see is like my limits like my that's why i imagine perceived like what you what you see right now through the camera is the is my skin so it's it's my borders if you want to think in a three-dimensional space is this side if i come here this side or this side but you cannot see that what is happening in between the sides uh i don't know it's in my head like that so my intention was like through a point of view i wanted to share my view of my world at that moment but then uh i think it it i didn't felt it was working more than just showing yeah i mean my intention was it should give like some dimensionality of my persona you see but instead of that it will just like portray the image that it was not so bad it worked i guess partly it could be better but it didn't give the dimension that i expected yeah i don't know i think what you mean like to me it was like at the end i was using that video to uh overlay myself on your phone camera and i liked it because it's something different from what i usually do what i usually receive from you but i think it's like that's i'm not saying that's it but i think it was interesting because it was something different but i didn't really see like why we're doing this besides that it's different or new and yeah i don't know i was just thinking like for example if you are doing if you're actually facing a green screen and you know uh showing your hands for example that could be something different because um i think in that in that viewpoint like it's not really about your body but your desk becomes more um prominent and it's about like i i was feeling that it's about interacting with your space but not with you so much true okay okay i see what i mean yeah yeah yeah actually if i think yeah one of the things that i was missing when i did the test this morning is that because it's of course not a proper tripod when i'm trying to do things with my hands i don't see them so well uh just when i'm doing these positions because then the camera is hanging but for the rest in these positions the camera won't really catch me often and i remembering my thought was i mean it was it was similar in that sense like i was losing i was missing my my yeah my my myself in there what i'm question when i'm kind of uh a question rises now from what you said is that um because you said it was why do you say something about if he's uh do we do this because he's new you know are we doing this because it's new um and this is a question that is the the now i'm putting here my things which is which is valid you know like if we do this because it's new it's okay but then we have to know but then we know you know like it's it's just because i want to try it and it doesn't have more reason than that or it has really a reason and then i want to drive but it doesn't mean that it's a i mean because today we had reasons why we tried different different new things but you know it didn't work as expected so it's good that we tried it that's for sure yeah but yeah it's it's hard because in this chat we've been like talking about really like more into the conceptual things and then we suddenly like you know put different like new technical things then it's it's very distracting yeah go together and spend like in two weeks or something because then i'm thinking that um it's different now because we have just limited time per week you know it's like we have one hour like or something so we have to choose we have to take decisions but i'm thinking like what for instance if we are in space and we are in the residence and then we can that we can test different versions of what we do and and i guess things will come or not but there is more there is more time and space to because there's so many questions and so many things that we want to share with the other one you know like i know there are things that you want to share with me and the things that i want to share with you in the pr about the practice and so but it's just it's just the space that we have is limited and you have things to do i have some things to do so it's just it's like that um [Music] so one of the things that you said the last time with the streaming that i feel this time as well is that because when there is the live streaming there is so much thing going on that i didn't i didn't dance i mean i didn't i didn't get in the zone of dancing or feeling free with the dance and i'm missing that i'm missing that this is the second this is the second streaming and i'm not feeling that i don't know how it's from for your side from your side with this second experience of streaming yeah i mean it's it's like this time it was just simply difficult because of the let's say the constraints more than um technical i mean technical constraints or whatever uh that we talked about i don't know if that we would simply relate to streaming or if we do it like more like a simple version next time uh just with streaming with the practice we've been doing and is it still like difficult to move or is it easy to move but actually today i was not like i was not checking the live streams because it was already too much i checked i was checking i have yeah i have yeah i have two screens two laptops i was checking sometimes uh at some point i wanted to use the stream as a feed so the youtube screen to create like this feedback the last time we talked but then i was g and it was almost just 10 minutes left and i thought like i was getting a bit like where they should be going in and that no this thing and then i started doing something else and i i thought i want to read a little i thought i want to use a little bit of the feedback with this text that i'm reading uh and then i thought so i arranged that uh for the end before the time was uh gone but i i was first i was checking just now in my just just for curiosity to see if there were people watching the streams and then i saw there were eight people or and then i was surprised there was eight views already so there should be at least five people watching so i put it on my facebook i don't know which is weird because sometimes we get no views i guess one or two that is you or me i guess but like yeah the in this stream i was just checking mine and then there were eight views and i was thinking like i don't know it's just it just changes the dynamics as well a bit it's just it's not the same that when we do you know it feels a bit more private i don't know it's weird because at the end you share it as well with the pub with the public what you do you know when we're doing without the streaming we record but then we put it out but the feeling is different now yeah i mean to me because i was not checking the stream so that's why i think it didn't really um i didn't really feel anything that like that but it would be definitely different if we start you know check the streaming and you know people comment or just see how many people are viewing then of course you know you're conscious about what's happening and and it's happening real time you know it's not just you film it and put it online afterwards but it's it's happening you know this feedback is happening already while we're practicing um it's weird now because i mean there is how to express like in terms of time there is when we do the practice and there is no live streaming we do the thing and then it's like we we frozen the time and then we wait until you publish and you're in your channel so it's like we finished we did the thing that we wanted to do and then we publish in the coming days so it's like we finish but then we go like this in a block we suspend ourselves in time and then nobody else know about this reality that we create until you expose it through your channel right i'm thinking that now when we live stream there is this this reality it just is out already now from the first moment is out um yeah yeah i i think it lacks or like it's different ritual like because i like i like the word yeah like like you just said yeah like film it upload and share and now it's everything is together and yeah i i i feel like missing the this moment of you know uploading the video it's just like you know just drag and drop but it's something that really changes yeah for you you know what actually this is that you said is so true i like this that you said about the ritual because when i was putting on my facebook i something about best practices and the link on my web in my facebook i felt something which is now i understand is like i was missing to do the copy paste of all my hashtags and just structure the message as i always do i just put like blood over i don't know like and the link so it was something missing in that ritual is true that because we are doing it so many times like it's just so it's ridiculous because for me it's just copy paste from uh from a previous message in facebook always and at that moment because already we were streaming so it was like two minutes after 10 or something i didn't thought about it but i felt a bit weird and now that you said this is true like i guess i was kind of missing the ritual or maybe there's a confusion in my head like you're talking you're you're sharing something that you are going you are you are about yes let me try to put it like this it's like when i post it in facebook is i'm my body i'm feeling i'm gonna share this that we did that we care we share the space and time and we care already so then we then i feel i'm gonna share this with the world even if there's nobody watching you know but just the the just the action is uh the ritual is like that well now is i guess is i'm saying i'm sharing something with the world that i don't even know what is it yeah yeah also like if you record it you can like i don't of course i don't watch it uh before i upload it but you know i check a little bit what happened and that doesn't happen anymore i mean i can also revisit what we just live streamed but like but it's already shared like there's nothing that you take the steps before sharing i think it has to be with this in a way i'm seeing we are getting in somewhere i guess this uncomfort or this thing that we don't understand it should come from this self-reflection or like this this idea of seeing yourself and basically actually accepting the image of yourself at that moment what i'm saying is that because i'm doing the same like when when when i'm about to send you the video of just when we finish i check or there is my i feel somehow i will put it in a way it's like maybe it's like when i when you take a and you look at what you just whatever i i feel something like is like something that it comes out from me it feels that it comes out of me and you know watches you check uh and and that's it because i know that we are editing you know before uploading when we do the best practices but i think there should be something in there like yeah i mean similar of i'm thinking like in a really low level maybe the similar of what it happens when you look yourself uh to a mirror like should be something in there like i don't know your expectations of do you like yourself today you feel handsome today you know partly like this but i i'm curious like well right now i don't know if we decide to you know continue live streaming but let's say if we do it no no i think we should keep on doing it but especially in some times in some moments yeah sure like but then my question was like if we switch to live streaming like completely let's say and then after some time do we still feel like we're missing this ritual or we just like completely get used to it because you know i think yeah i think i don't get used to yeah i think so too i mean yeah but i think that this reflection was really interesting but it's not that it's something necessary it's just like how we yeah we just get used to it and we find meanings or yeah attached to look back before we post it or whatever yeah in a way it seems to me this should be some mechanism of protection you know because i mean it's not that we are changing the video but if you really think you know in a uh instinctive level is that you can i mean really if we do the practice and record it and for some reason something went really wrong or you use or i use some words or something you still have the chance to erase it at that moment you know like you don't have to upload it but when it was live stream you can then uh erase it afterwards but if there were somebody watching at that moment you don't know right so that i think is the situation of control that i think you should go into some really uh inner level i don't know like should be something primal in that aspect between like we control what we are uploading and versus not controlled whatsoever yeah yeah i understand um anything else you want to share i just want to say if there's nothing then we can close and i think we could talk about this more logistics i think that yeah now of course then i'm going to stop the recording thank you for watching", "yFVU_AnFySw": "[Music] what's up what's up we are back from the there is no feedback in this one we can stream quickly that feedback no thank you i think that was intense yes but i think it was always fun that uh we paused it for some time and then and you replayed it i mean you played it not live you know yeah from where it was but that was a nice surprise because as you it was kind of it became but i think what's cool is that that could be an element i put it in my notes that as a sound if we are conscious of that it can become more like a performing element then we know for instance okay gonna be feedback and then we consciously then we do something about it but we can also look with video what do you mean like video video because it's uh difficult to do video feedback for like you know one minute two minutes but if we just stream it to youtube and just use the the window from youtube that you you know you pause it for some time and they play it again then it will you know follow after one minute two minutes and then you can use that as a as a video feed yeah we can try that so i think it was very nice but but but i want to i tried i tried to do my streaming and i was streaming but i don't know wait i want to just because i just want where do i have a question so where those streams they go if i if i stream i think i think let's i don't know if you wait what is the purpose of this chant is it like reflecting on what we do or like what we did or like is it more about the practical things no no no no let's just make it uh reflecting a bit yeah and we can you know we can look into the streaming later i mean not today but uh sometimes i was very excited i think it was completely different because of the i mean it just becomes the whole it feels very dense in space and time you know it feels very dense you know that's my experience i feel like whoa i mean it was so funny it reminds me from this book of borrows the jonathan borders that at some point it says about audience like the first thing that you get in a performance is like the contract he speaks about a contract so it's a contract that you have with the audience the way how you start the performance uh it's like yeah and in a way we all say we came to the live streaming and the first thing that appeared was the feedback that was the first thing that appeared so then from there everything was just like okay this is just like this and it was so it like took you and me because we both were like surprised but at the same time like surrender you know like i have in a way i have to compare that experience with similar what i'm taking what i took sides like heavy heavy psychedelics like uh ayahuasca like really heavy because the way how i felt that we did is like something very strong in that case technologically was happening and then we bought what we did like surrender you know like so and just okay this is like this and then just we go uh yeah that was very cool true yeah well i mean we have to accept that yeah that's what we did that's what we did but then at the same time then i think that i i wanted to talk with you is because i like it very much but at the same time i'm it's like very powerful no it's like i feel it this like though in the way i felt like when i took like psychedelics in the sense like and because it still is very it happens so you feel like open like gates is like wow this can happen you know like there's so many things that can go you know at some point we were saying like i said at the hour just to calculate how many minutes were in feedback and then it came back at some point it's just it opened so many portals that you can keep on going like that's like thousands space and like not even the visual but that your brain understand parts of the things and it's just like keeps on going in in a house called like oscillos know when you have these patterns that you see that prismas you know that you have this uh the toledo scope led scope effect like in a way i feel like that my brain was like partly so that you don't understand but in a way you understand that is yeah i felt i really felt that very psychedelic the whole experience because of that then i wanted as well then to do it sometimes but not all the time true yeah i also felt like you know today i couldn't really move much because it was no neither but but maybe but it's true that what you said kind of explains i mean i think for me it was a bit different but still yeah it's relevant how you said it because that's you know conditioning my presence and my body so it's not just like i do whatever because it's like in a way it's distracting the sound i mean not distracting always in a bad way but definitely it's dominating the space yeah yeah that's actually something that's true that we i realized that some some some meetings before the sound yeah sound uh invasive invasive uh the sound is something that is very invasive um so but what i realized is for instance like some meetings sometimes have some practice to go then when you're doing getting that very physical then then of course then you're breathing and and then you have your own music but i cannot hear the only thing that i hear is your breathing and then sometimes it's way too much and i but then i found a way how in hydra i can just mute you some of the windows in the browser yeah or lively yeah i mean has a fader or a mixer yeah i i didn't i was for two i think for two practices i was going crazy with your sound and then at some point i find that i found a way how i can select the the window that i wanted to mute yeah [Music] so from where was the sound we're trying as i'm trying like understanding so i put so the feedback was generating because you have the microphone open your your headphone open no because you play this no um wait you say something let's stream to youtube and then you play back that on your computer and were you like opening the speaker like you're listening from the speaker yeah then you know the microphone picks that sound and send it to me on light lab because we are on the video call and then it's sent to back to the youtube again and then it plays on your computer and it sends to me on live lab and then goes to youtube it's just like you know repeating feedback loop yeah so but then yeah so what i did was at some point and just went i can mute the sound so but i could control it i guess you could control as well because you have to mute me you know yeah i didn't think that way because i like i'm always like um careful about muting you because it's you know sometimes it becomes like the only channel that we can communicate but then uh so today i just didn't do it but i did um change like i was playing with the setting the mixer on obs so it was i thought it was not sent to youtube anymore but it was i was still hearing the sound i don't know i i need to check what how it went it was a bit mysterious like a whole thing but it was very nice like i'm really yeah i think i said um yeah something as well but that's yeah that's just technical maybe we can we can meet at some point this week like there was to talk just uh to talk a little bit of the streaming for instance we can do some technical meeting before thursday yep will be that good sounds good okay um yeah do you want to say something um i don't know i i like the to your uh uh reading the book uh yeah it was it was very funny because i was uh between some books for now and this was about yeah from an object and i was reading a lot about time today so it was just in my head it's just the whole experience becomes very psychedelic very very fun yeah also like when you start reading like i was i was like you know trying to move slow and also like at the end i was using my phone to capture myself just to play with time something that i that i realized is and as i think i mentioned the last time about when the camera is moving so for instance i have this camera so there was one point that we both understood like so we both slowed completely what we were doing and we were into something together and it was when this camera was moving at some point i don't know exactly what i was doing but then i when i checked the live blob as well you were doing in the same speed something i don't know exactly what but the the speed of what we were doing was the same interesting yeah uh and i just something i put it in my notes that that's how i felt like that one because i felt that i didn't move that much today i yeah the the moving of the camera at some point um in a way that's the way huawei interpreted like if you are following if uh live love what you're seeing i think that's my intention i i think that's why i read that is that it's difficult for you to to uh ignore that this is moving because it's very it's very drastic so either so in my i think my reading of the what i'm trying to say is like either this is happening what is way too much so then right you will be doing something like this to me i will i guess try to avoid it because after at some point i just get tired of it but if you are more soft in your moving i cannot avoid to looking at you because this is you're changing the position like the in a way the matrix of like the composition of your image yet in a way is like the matrix because i'm thinking now in space so it's like the matrix so like the dimension that you are presenting is constantly moving so that's why it demands attention for me i need to where are you going with that you know because it's not so drastic so i can go with you and and be there and i feel something like that when you were doing as well the phone uh the phone because in a way it was like it's a it's a frame so it's a new dimension it's clearly you're you're asking you know way attention like look at this and it's very defined you know there is this dimension like that yeah that was that was really interesting to me because it's like my intention was to play with time so i record it and it will repeat but then what happened was like because of the framing it's so um analog and also yeah it did really you know not dictate but it it says something not not just the video itself no yeah it turns that's what i mean that was what i was trying to to i think speak about dimension or the matter of this matrix system that it is very strong to to as as as soon as you put it it's just something that is there is an element that is you're introducing a gate basically a portal to something new that is very strong a very strong element yeah and also like from the last practice i started to feel that i really have to come close to the camera to do something because like when i'm just like moving in the background it's like you know more intuitive for me but then like visually like what you said you know like moving fast doesn't really catch your attention i mean also it doesn't catch my attention you know it's just like i'm moving and it's not really like from the last chat like i'm not really creating an image in a way and then if i come close with the you know with the phone or with my hand or with my face i can articulate more yeah the way i think one day we were talking about i think there was i think it's related in my head who i see about like uh intentions and this kind of this the directionality that i comple i relate to what you said it's true like either or i'm here close so i'm i'm in the zone or i'm in the flow of doing something because actually i have the my reference as well so if this is a camera i have a camera that is here but my laptop is here so if i'm doing here i can still look in there so i have the ref i am compositing and i can do it more in purpose or like very very rational or in between but still i'm there and the other one who is very far away when just you try really dance and just let it go and then i think this this the way who i perceive this in my own perception is that it's a very conflicted it's a very conflictive uh scenario between this being free here in the back or conflict yeah maybe it does not the word but this is a both places are different like being here alone in like dancing alone and the being doing this here the intention is very different and in a way the i feel what i'm trying to do with myself sometimes like trying to do softly a change in between i don't find it because i thought they changed they because i feel that there's a drastic change that i have to do between being here or being here in terms of what is happening um so it's kind of like a it's like an open question that i how can we propose they turn the the the intermedium uh the connection between these two sides um yeah that's more like operation how can we connect both sides because this is this is certainly i think more interesting in terms of image composition yeah uh and the performance because it's two-dimensional and a computer so it would be more visual but this one is certainly more close to the flow of being dancing and being free totally so the two elements are completely valid for what you're doing in my understanding so that is the question how can we find a connection between the two because our different references yeah yeah yeah yeah i think that's that's really related to what i was saying last time was it like i i don't know if i if i explicitly said that but um it's it's really yeah like i don't know if i would say intermediate or something that bridges or like can we actually break that those you know uh like for example can i actually compose something while i'm here and you know just moving for myself let's say and having fun moving and does it like still like is it able to create image project image or if i'm here well i don't know if i'm here i'm dancing like crazy then probably i'll bump into the computer or the display and it's not a great idea but if you have more control yeah you have more control when you're close with the computer yeah to what you can do com in terms of composition image composition yeah yeah i understand i think i understand what you said but it's a challenge no because i'm thinking yeah it's a challenge like yeah because they in the back is is in a ways like that is the dance you know it's like the it's yeah i don't know it's very very um i find it very childish it's very very liberating you know this one in the back is like just very yeah just very liberating yeah so yeah yeah here it's you're more focused on the the screen right because and then you then you will apply things that you know or consciously or unconscious then you will jump to the computer to play with the hue like yeah then you will do things in purpose maybe you have to attach the camera like here yeah that's actually that's why but that actually does what i was trying i have i bought some cable so i have this right now is five meters cable of camera but i bought an extension a signal repeater so i haven't tested but in theory i can have up to 11 meters now of the camera because at some point i was in this semester i was researching a bit of thinking of of the limitation of the yeah this is just the whole thing that we just speak spoke um i see this yeah it's just yeah yeah it's a research question yeah and the way hope in my understanding the way who i see it is because i think both places are different so at some point i was trying to like maybe change my doing here to becoming more like here uh but then in my my own thinking i i thought afterwards that it's just comp is the nature the intention of the of the spaces are different what i'm in front is i'm doing something but in the back i'm doing something so instead of fighting and trying to change what i'm doing here to become more visually appealing um then i'm trying to put that more as a question how can i connect these two places because that will that would be more interesting uh because yeah yeah it's just in a way like dramatically speaking there is a there is a hole in between the two so if you just find somehow like or how can connect this or can these two places be connected it's uh i think that's one perspective or one approach i i don't know how like what to respond to it but personally like when i'm really like moving freely it's usually about shapes in the space that i think about so i'm interested in how i can project those shapes as a visual image from visual image visual i don't know like visual output which is probably impossible because it's something like what i imagined so i can't really project it but like that's that's what i'm interested um i don't know but then you know i think dancers would dance to project that but i don't know if i want to dance to well i dance for myself but it's not not necessarily the output i don't know whatever um yeah i don't know maybe next week i'm saying something totally different anyways okay cool i don't know if you have to go but no yeah yeah i think i i will go uh i think it's good just to just close like this it was with the questions yeah but i think it's good just to keep it like like just leave it as questions i think it's great yeah totally yeah um so happy birthday thank you did you have a did you have that you did something for yourself like just another day but yeah i mean i i met some friends which is you know rare thing these days yeah i know yeah i know i already started like talking uh with my girlfriend like seeing like yeah trying to convince her like could you maybe if we what if we go like some like uh like the 22 something like that to puff so i started like talking to her like like honey her ear because she has them to drive us all the way till there um and then we have to see about the coffee like then we have to clean some paper like because normally you're not supposed to travel but you get to travel if you're working so then maybe we have to ask maybe to just to make sure to buff to make to say like uh just to have a letter yeah yeah i see yeah as well because we'll be united we'll be nicer if we go if she take us there uh then we both foreigners in the train you know going there with the whole thing right now it's a bit like it's i mean more consistently yeah i mean yeah especially with the asians this is reality like so then yeah then the two not white person that i think is better if like she's a blonde woman she can take us there it would be easier in this moment this is the politics that we are yeah unfortunately anyways okay so let's let's close it here yeah so yeah yeah we meet this week", "qREivCO_sKE": "okay okay hello hello everyone i don't know what who everyone is we are here with cable it's a lot of cables oh yeah we have a bunch of cables i mean i i started uh playing with the this oh you did you bought that or did you borrow from the school or from yeah i borrowed from where i kind of where i'm helping and uh yeah like they do a bunch of vr stuff so they have tons of headsets and first i asked can i have oculus quest because that's the standalone thing that you don't have to connect to the computer so i thought it's easy but yeah apparently it's the most popular one so they don't want i mean they have but they need uh like soon like they you know they're booked so instead i got this which is uh htc vive like old version of five and um i like the previous version of that one and not oculus it's a vive it's a like vibe has different versions now but it's the first one i don't know if like maybe it's like from four or five years ago and uh but it still has the triggers yeah yeah these controllers right yeah yeah it's it's tracked so you have to like put the you know the sensors in the in the corner of your room and uh it works quite quite well it's really fun yeah i remember i tried literally like four years ago i think i should try maybe that version that you have or something i was working with an artist and he was a vr artist and he let me try that and i remember there was an application to kind of modeling something pain tilt brush tilt brush something yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and yeah and then you were yeah that was a very popular one yeah so i think i tried that literally and that's it and then all this time that i was in the school i think they so they bought that and i think the last two years they get a different ones or new ones and i don't know but i have no idea of and i and i never tried the new ones uh until the last time when we were in node i tried which one they have a node that was uh okay this quest that's that's a there's a computer uh that you don't need by itself no yeah yeah that's the one i mentioned earlier that i first want it because then you don't have to connect to the computer but it's also really popular and this one that you have you have to connect it to your computer yeah yeah so that's another story that uh you know like i was i got i got a new computer after node and it's quite powerful but uh so far i was only running linux and it's fine for what i do with you know like playing with browser or sound and stuff but uh vr support is really limited so i had to install it yeah like the os itself no yeah only hardware yeah yeah because uh i wanted to you know i mean i support free open software so it's it's good motivation to use linux but then with the linux vr is like really crap like uh you know those companies they don't support it because there's not much uh uh users in that so i had to get windows and now i have windows which is which is a shame but also it's quite quite nice to you know run vr and um yeah it's uh it's working well it's fun this morning i was in a club in vr chat i don't know if you have any idea like it's like a it's like a second life but modern version a club is like it's like back in time but we have this chats when i mean when i remember when the internet came out and then you uh you were just excited i mean just the chat yeah it was i don't know it was called clubs but it's just you go to rooms and start chatting with people i remember that when the internet came out then that was kind of like the yeah there was a trend to do that or i i was doing that because i was so amazed that you could just talk with some more people like now it seems sounds super old for people but i remember them yeah i mean it's funny that you mentioned it's funny that you mentioned that because i think it's really interesting thing although i what i meant was totally different because uh it's just a vr chat it's just a name of the app that you know you become an avatar and you can socialize with people like other other avatars and the club is just you know like nightclub yeah you go to a nightclub virtual nightclub and then you know there's music and you just you know see people say really weird and then you talk with them or you or you uh type with them uh you have a microphone because you can talk but uh i actually the nicest thing is you can control the volume like uh other video games you know you can have like a ui sound or like you know the bg like background music and stuff like you have controls right the volume of the sound like you mean that if i controlling the the rest of like or the environment sound yeah like a just a volume mixer and it's so funny because you can you know if you want to talk to someone you can just lower the volume of the music and uh crank up the volume of the people talking and if you want to use the music or dance just you could just reverse it so it's just so funny application to so but that's something that it runs so you need a br set right or you need to be uh and then you it's just something that it runs on the browser or you need to install the application it depends i think most of the things like you need to install the steam but it's called steam and steamvr like a app that it's like app store for video games oh yeah for video games or for vr uh both like okay there's one that you can play video games with or without vr but you have this extension for vr so you can play vr video games how it's called that that store steam steam store yeah it's gonna store just i want to see what is it store steam powered i don't think it's this one store is steam powered store this is a store okay somebody show it to me at some point i guess i remember it's it's called esteem stories theme power dot com right is it probably yeah they have like list of video games right i guess yeah it's more video games your store steam okay yeah and um i remember at some point somebody showed me this as a wallpaper to yeah there was some wallpaper that the person installed okay oh yeah i remember doing this okay there's also browser support for vr so if you have like uh you know if you play mozilla hubs like we did in node you can just open it on the browser and well maybe you still need steamvr installed and then you can just view that environment in vr this so this but this shop this steam shop is so it's something you can connect from the br you can go there and then you will be browsing uh yeah like for the video games yeah you just launched app on steam and then i mean you have to download it first and then you launch it and then it's gonna show up in the headset i'm still trying to discover i just started so i don't know exactly like for me i think it's like uh i think at some point i will i will check a little bit of what is the vr but i remember at some point in this coupon they were like kind of like start seeing what is i thought okay no i'm not gonna do this right now no i was out of i was not a fan of it for some time and now i'm not saying i'm i'm a fan of vr um but you know why not trying it and um to be honest like dancing in a vr club is you know really strange experience i i don't really feel i'm actually dancing because you know holding a controller and you know moving is just like not cool and i'm just like bumping into the wall all the time like i remember as well that we were in no we were trying to do with gloria to see like to to do like a dancing session with the br but yeah i remember then then just we thought okay the problem is like then you have the hands and the face and that's it that's what you get so that's what you have like this and and then i thought okay right after then i thought like oh okay that's it i mean still still you can perceive like the dancing i guess because you can just go for it dancing but if somebody's seeing you it will just not see what is happening you know you see the hands going like a puppet yeah but yeah this is something definitely that i think i uh i don't know for instance if i would like to dive in and try and develop something with it but i certainly at some point i would like to understand because i don't really i feel that i'm very um uh could you call it an alphabet in be art i i feel that i don't understand really well what is it and you know like this just this that you were saying to me like steam like no idea these terms and ideas yeah yeah it's it's for me it's also like about you know learning things like it's not like i'm so into it but i i feel like i need to catch up yeah so i feel like that but for me it's like i i need some time so what is good that you're doing that you give me some shortcuts at some point yeah like yeah don't spend time here spend time here and then also you have to get a good windows computer oh yeah that's true yeah yeah if you want to do it by yourself yeah yeah yeah now so i'm yeah i have to buy a uh because i need to i realize that not like since node and it's now that i have been using uh notch and other things i realize if you really want to use some graphical things you need to use windows that's the only way to i mean if you really need to use it's different if you are let's say just modeling or something because i mean there's some of these software still you can use maya or some adobe or some things like hooligans uh supported in linux as well houdini yeah they they support uh windows mac linux i think yeah which is really cool but like let's say they to really use like the you have to use the gpu the graphical the gpu then you need to use windows like uh if you really want to use i don't know things between uh one software to the other ones like there are some interesting things that i start to see like that they're kind of they're they're just they're not so old so it's like happening not to love my goats so that you can create things let's say notch and then you can export that and then you can as a blog seed and touch designer or other ways of communication but then you need to have a good a good uh an nvidia card let's say an immediate card yes you're right yeah you need to have a nvidia card that is yeah a modern proper nvidia card um so yeah i have been researching at the and i think so i i know i need to make a windows computer at some point but so far i have been doing it with my mac that is not old and it's okay uh but for some what i'm trying to play when i'm trying to do like ray tracing there's no way to go like when they really go are really harker with those and it's something that i don't know if i want to yeah i'm gonna use this i think i'm not but just if i want to test with my laptop and it's just a computer it's just there's no way to go if i really if they if the scene has ray tracing just activate and some things it just goes bananas it's just no working yeah also i think uh nvidia has advantage in the the fluid simulation yeah yeah yeah i don't know like uh physical physics yeah yeah i've been i mean different places that i've been reading and different things in the last six months basically you need to wait so windows and then an nvidia car makes a huge difference than the amd but so uh i think i'm gonna what i'm gonna do is like until i build a windows because then i will i didn't build i haven't built uh a tower before so and i don't want to spend too much time right now thinking which motherboard which you know like all these things i think just now what i'm going to do is just buy an egpu and include so the case and the gpu that i can put after in the target eventually yeah uh so then i will have to pay more let's say 250 euros something like this for the case uh for the egpu case with uh but it's okay because at the end i can just move the graphic card expensive yeah yeah yeah so it doesn't really fit to what what you want to do but the machine i got is quite uh i'm really happy with it it's like you know it's not that big yeah it's a bit bigger than mac mini and uh and it looks better but yours is like you you still pay how much you pay for that i forgot like 1500 or something plus 100 like maybe 14 plus uh you know the storage and ram so end up like you know 1600 or 1700 and then which uh which gpu do you have it's uh rtx 2060 but it's like a mobile version like foreign it has less power than the i don't exactly know but uh yeah i have been searching yeah there there is a difference of course yeah it's not the same that that power because of the cannot the clock speak cannot go so because of the power the the feeling of the but is not super drastic uh but so what i'm trying to do is now because it's so difficult nowadays like trying to buy a they have this new uh 30 series so with rtx 30 so and they are cheaper than the previous ones but there's impossible to buy and uh because there's a lot of people from this block change that they buy because of the way they mine and then when they the new rtx this they they came out then just buy it they just cleaned the whole things uh and it's this there is a car that was there's like the 360 rts 360. uh like the price in the states i think is around 400 euros so it's not really expensive comparing with the previous years but then if you find it here say in europe or in london i have been searching and just constantly seeing when sometimes there is something available to see what is the price then is um you would have to pay like 700 euros it's a lot more than you because it's just the offered on demand of the market now it's like this so it just sucks and as well it's not it's to be honest as well is not real it's not easy yeah like first i was searching like for two months and at some point i found one that you could buy at that moment like from a shop uh with warranty and and i didn't um and then that was maybe one opportunity in the last two months and i'm checking almost every every night just for a second with uh yeah so it's impossible um maybe you should make a boat but the checks every night and uh if there's available it just sends you a notification yeah yeah that's true yeah there's a lot of memes and things around it like this i think there's even some people put like in youtube like a constant streaming of a bot that it has in colors of the availability in all uh different places um yeah but what i'm thinking as well now is that i'm trying to see like in finding other markets and trying to buy like the because there are people who buy who bought away like the uh 30 version so now they are selling their 2016 let's say somebody buy the 30 80 rtx 3080 now then maybe they have from the previous year at 2016 so they are just selling that second hand but then it's a bit tricky because then you don't know you know like it's going to work it's not going to work like it's with electronics and secondhand is always like yeah i mean it's not the best thing you want to do no no but yeah anyway so that's that's that's uh what i'm doing these days thinking yeah yeah i mean it's it's something that's it's like a shame that you know we have the computer itself is a commodity and everyone has a smartphone everyone has it but but it's just like you know if you once you want to do something like that with visuals or audio is not so bad but especially visuals it's like you know like sky's limit in terms of equipment and um yeah i was like for so many years like i was thinking that i can just stick to like low end computer and just do whatever i can do with those machines but um but once you get a good one then you know it it's just you're gonna go back you can go back now this is good when when i was using iphones i remember i didn't have an iphone on the i don't care i mean i i was like two years ago and then i i guess i wanted to have an iphone because i don't know i guess brand i don't know in my head but at some point somebody gave it to me as a present so i didn't bought it and i think i lost it in a week or two weeks but in those two weeks that the the and it was the iphone 4 and in those two weeks i was so then when i lost it i i just have to buy one so at the end i think i lost it and two days after i bought uh yeah i bought a new one like expensive because yeah it's what you said no until you don't have it then you are not missing that yeah it's like you get spoiled yeah well i don't know like it's one on one side it's like a luxury thing but also like if you like for the practice we do it's definitely like you want a good computer like especially like you know obs studio is you know eats a lot of power yeah and um yeah like like before i was i was using like sometimes like two computers two low-end computers try to you know um try to distribute the the load so that it won't um go crazy but it was not really working and uh yeah as soon as i got the new one like you know everything works at 60 frames per second and yeah it's just it's just different and i i i need it anyways for the for the practice which is you know kind of weird to me because like it's it's for me it's the practices about movement and it's not really about making crazy visuals i don't know how yeah but yeah yeah yeah what i'm thinking now is that because i i'm thinking of on streaming because that's part of the things that i'm gonna work on my on my final work so streaming and i don't have experience working with streaming so that's somehow like in a way i'm seeing kind of like working with the scenes like that i have created scenes uh so in a way it's like it will say like a like a yeah performance in the sense that uh yeah buddhist scenes that something happens here and then some fade off or something whatever and then next scene next scene next could be like two scenes three things four scenes but one i was thinking is like maybe perhaps could be interesting if i could if i could integrate somehow to put the practice uh which is very specific scene you know what we do is very two-dimensional it's not really 3d uh and it's it has that shape you know that is very it has that a specific quality um this is interesting because um yeah something i i was thinking in a different context like i wanted to work more like a three-dimensional way and but what we do is really 2d and it's just like about the the screen like you know the last time i was painting myself and i was thinking like i was hoping that i could extend my body somehow in a space but it's like it's not that's not how it works it's just like paint stays on my body and then whatever i do is just 2d that's you know like in the image but i mean we go this specific i think there are some things that because it's interesting what you're saying that um uh yeah so there are two things that i would like to say that um wait yeah i know so directly and then uh one is that i think with the cool thing of what you are doing is that the uh yeah if somebody is looking at this watching then is that in the previous session man i also decided to use paint like at some point just i i would say like that i the previous session i enjoyed myself a lot and i i was on myself a lot which in the previous few sessions i did not the last session i was very happy i know now why because i was using more bdmx and so i was not so so i but it was cool because i didn't plan anything i just know okay i have this base of code i know that i'm using often this and there's some functions that are almost i repeat these functions of the all the time in hydra and now and then so instead of trying to go from uh more complicated in in that i will just then i just stay there and then for other things i will just go in video mix that i know better and do other things and that will work very much so i was very very happy and at some point and then i guess i lost you in my things then when i see you back you are literally like william william well as in braveheart like completely fainted and i was like what so i remember because i was doing my thing then i have to stop and then i was i was kind of i was looking at you and then i start appreciating like the it i think it i feel that it transmits even though it's two-dimensional you know even into the lim the limits of what we do because we are streaming basically so the the image is very the quality is is like that um but so within the the medium it it transmits um a very human expression of of yeah maybe as well because you were not i was not expecting that you will do something like that the last two sessions and maybe i can mention it now that i when we finished the last chat i said i would like to say something but i want to wait until the next sessions to see how i feel about it and then but the thing was the last two sessions i felt the that you were gone that you were the that you were gone in the the glitching of i felt that you were i felt you a lot apart in the before these two sessions i didn't felt like that way so it could be many things it is it doesn't it's not good it's not it's that it's good or it's bad it's just how i felt so that's when we do this session you were you were um you were very communicative in a way or like you were very analog in the in the i mean i see you i don't see glitches of you i see you apart because i can hear you so it was very surprising it was very i was very surprised and and then at some point i have to stop and then leave you in my screen and that was very nice because then i was contemplating you on my screen that i put it in certain ways um i have to watch it and it looks very cool yeah you sent me the speech but yeah yeah and in some moments like you were it's it's because it's like you look almost like a child when it's painting yeah you know like it's for children anyways yeah it's for children is it yeah so could you could you wash your face just with water oh this stays there yeah it's it's like a you know safe thing i can even eat it i think i don't know oh man but it was it was i really that's why i said afterwards in the chat that i really appreciate that moment because uh it was very personal the way how i felt it was like okay thank you that that felt very human yeah that's um yeah i will normally am more used to now that we work within glitches and those are very harsh things that are very sharpy and this is just very sharpie but on the body this is just very it's very crazy and i remember that i have this image of i'm doing my thing and then then i just i come back and then i whoa i like i i literally see like william wallace doing this painting his face in braveheart i wasn't really working just on my t-shirt but it does i don't know like maybe next time can you show us the t-shirt again yeah but i don't know like i think it's it's more fun to you know like paint on my arms and face because then i can you know really move it because it's if it's here then it just stays here but then did you have problems after like touching i mean with the computer afterwards because you did you painted so surprisingly the keyboard was intact and mouse fine the table i mean the desk there was a little bit of mark but uh was not so bad it dries quite fast and uh i think it's good that it's for children maybe i should get another one of those because if it's like a proper paint then you know it will be like it will be a hell to remove them um wait they're just putting some notes yeah but i don't know how was uh yeah so this is one thing the other thing i think it's interesting what you're saying of uh this 3d thinking or something that could be a topic that we can uh talk at some point like in my experience this semester when i'm when i'm working with uh this um in a way like this notch is is it's like a shortcut how to create like these crazy things uh which is with few you put five things together and then you have a complex particle system that it looks amazing the normally in touch designer will talk you so long i mean it will take you certainly longer than what you do with notch so so you have this thing that creates this quality this image uh with some so such a quality that you can use cameras to move the perspectives uh so yeah you can use a 3d space and then put a camera and then do like if if i'm dancing here whatever it is that i'm doing here with a kinect or anything then the camera do this this this crazy things with the the position and then i have to think a lot in the um i'm still thinking i need to i'm taking this two weeks because i just finished the last week my exams taking these two weeks to kind of like just not do too much and just like be more fluid and what i want to do but when i'm reflecting on that i'm thinking that when you when you're when you're moving uh if there is motion and then there is this frame that you are seeing me and that's what we do know uh the this is the the frame and this is and regardless of and on top of this then we put layers and then we glitch the layers so they might be cut or different effects right on this image but still the camera mostly is framed so it's it still has this shape while then in the 3d space then you can just move the camera and the perspective in different positions and that not necessary is not necessarily good it's just it's completely in my experience and my thinking it just made me think like do i need to move the camera like because otherwise it becomes like if i move uh if i move maybe the camera doesn't have to move that much or if the camera moves it's almost i don't have to move that much because doing the two things it becomes like a super saturated experience that is like what is happening uh but this is kind of my notes in my my experience working with that uh in that specific setup of the kinect and the so the body meshed with particle systems they can be just a simple system that is almost just my body or can even just a little bit reacting you know like uh you know what i mean like the particle system can be just me uh and a mesh or it can be things coming out from my mesh so so just starting from that point of view the clean idea is just the body no movement but just when i move the particles reappear from where i'm moving from the mesh you see what i'm saying um yeah yeah so basically like how complete how complex the image gets uh these verses between a clean image that a person can understand it's not demanding too much and it's not gonna be aggressive or something that is completed and more complex and and then i think it's i i think i would like to go like to think i don't know what do you think about this this this whole rumbling that i'm saying yes because this is really something i mean it's going to be really specific but also i was thinking because i was also thinking like what if i have for example connect and let's say like i have a different program that like you know tracks my body and like morphs my body in 3d space and use it as input in hydra for example that would be something but then like i don't really know what i want to do because i was just like today i was just thinking like i think i have two things that i want to do and one is that i want to make image in a 2d space that doesn't have to be like spatial because anyways it's gonna be in 2d unless like we make a vr app or something that you have you can wear and you know see things in 3d maybe it's something different but it's a bit you know ambitious and the other thing is like i just want to have fun moving yeah and that's i mean that's sorry maybe just do an annotation there like for me the most important part that i'm seeing get a bit lost in that process is the fun part the practices are just freaking fun to do yeah um yeah yeah and then for example like you know when i dance in a club like i don't go to club that often but like when i go like i could really like um it's it's really spatial and you know with the music and the space and my body and it's just like exploring that these aspects is really fun and in the practice i can also do it but that doesn't necessarily come together with the image on the screen and so i don't know but also like that's kind of the good motivation because if i'm not having fun then there's no point doing the practice anyways because i don't want to just like move to make you know images on the screen that's like not something i want to do if it's not fun yeah because that's what i'm kind of thinking when i in this in the experience working with a 3d image or the complex image is like it becomes almost like i want to do it good then it's not fun anymore so and then and from that perspective is different than than the practice because in the practice sometimes the image gets very well done and things are happening but sometimes it's not and it doesn't matter in both the scenarios i'm okay and i'm happy and and it might be as well because i have a direct responsibility with you in the sense like you are there i'm not there alone then yeah i feel is there's a dialogue wow i think the the extreme example is when we were at node right like it was like total crap but it was so much fun but that was good that's super cool because then he said yeah they stole that crap but i was thinking that um maybe we should try to arrange and um and try to maybe go to path and or somewhere i think path could work may be like two weeks in path the internet there is no is okay now okay we can talk like in the and then if we try to not set it now but did you start thinking okay we can go in this time and spend two weeks because all these topics would be interesting like um uh to to think yeah but just like uh to add like uh for to what you were saying about you know composing things like in the 3d um like computer graphics for example like this is something i i was trying to do like for so many years i wouldn't make amazing visuals like a geometric algorithmic or procedural expressions and i did a bit and uh you know like some people liked it but then i was like i was just getting bored you know like it's just so boring to you know make all these little things and you know put together as a performance with visual whatever because like it's not physical at all like it's definitely coming from like movement like experience of the movements and you know i'm projecting that to these whatever visual stuff but it's definitely not my movement and then like before the last practice i was starting to think that i don't want to make images or objects to dance because i'm dancing and rather i would be the image oh that's just like my artistic statement yeah like okay we finished this this martinis pumbaa should be like tremble your feet like this is the new that will be in now thrown out or barianism now it's coming up can you repeat what just just said because the thing is uh yeah so i don't want to let images stance but i want to make myself an image this is so cool that you talk about this topic of the image because wait i will bring this book also [Music] i don't know what to do right now i just have to say something while he's gone um i don't know what to say um okay i'm back okay you're back i didn't say anything so there is have you heard of the book uh called the image of this guy called it crosses my i was searching for something and then i started searching in a way is a it comes from the so cool because it comes from the i bought it from amazon it comes from the gold goldsmith institute oh and i remember at some point when i wanted to study uh then i thought like i wanted to study there uh that was one of the places that i thought i would like to go but it was in london super expensive so i thought yeah i'm not gonna yeah it's a good school i would say yeah it's cool so when it came when it came to book then i thought oh so cool and yeah so what i want to share from this is like it's about the image and then it's basically divided in first like the role of the eye and then afterwards the role of the spectator the role of the apparatus so the mediums the role of the image and the role of the art so i'm just starting reading a bit um what is interesting of this idea of the image is that um that is this actually is not so visual as we think but it just is very it's conceptually like what uh what we see actually we just understand what you're seeing is in the back part of the brain the the visual cortex i don't know exactly what is it but what what it comes into the eyes is just light but when it becomes an image it's just after it could do some process so the image is actually not is is not we have this thinking of the image as what we see but it's actually just a cognitive process that is quite complex and i like the way because you have because you bring this that uh that you don't want to images to dance but you want to become an image yeah that's what you said uh um and i think very poetic that this idea of them uh of that um yeah wait so maybe doing simple so maybe i would like to share something from the last time that we did simple i put some notes sometimes i put some notes when i finish and then i say just doing what i know i yeah i put like i'm feeling like if i have took uh xanax which is very funny uh so i felt um when we finished i felt very i felt actually very grateful for the experience and i was feeling grateful because because you were painted so you gave me something that was very nice to feel um that was very cool very human some somehow so i was feeling very grateful or like very chill and that feeling oh i get when i'm when i take xanax so when i'm very nervous that i take these pills i feel like that and that was very funny to feel i thought it was very funny that i after i finish i feel like okay that was nice but like very chill and not super no no over excited that was very nice interesting yeah yeah how was your experience i want to hear how was your experience because i think i was like more opposite like more excited because you know i was going crazy and also like i was a bit nervous like how you would react to it um yeah but i think i really like that uh i said something in the beginning like at the beginning i said like uh i want i want your body to be something like uh your body yeah something like that and then you said it you repeat it you know like i want uh i want to have your body or something and i was like it just like stuck in my mind so i wrote it in the in the background at one point and i i think it was like something funny i mean yeah in a way that i it i don't know how to express but it came like kind of something to bridge what we do i mean to like between us in a way like it's like conceptually like it's in a way that's what kind of we're trying to do and also like i like when you know what you say transform or by other people and i received it from you and like this transformation was nice i think the was from well wait um i wanted to say something what was it yeah i forgot what i wanted to say i had the text because that i think this is the first time that that i see you you're using text i did it before but maybe i think it wasn't a practice but i don't know but i think this time you use it because it was not just one word but you use it you change the text a few times yeah um and it was cool and yeah i think it's just i think it was just cool it was a cool experience to to to be hanging maybe maybe yes to maybe tomorrow we can do it i'm not completely sure so we have to see okay yeah let's just just stop it for now i mean unless you have something to say oh but wait so maybe like i think what it would be exciting is to say some people that i think um will be nice to keep to in a way start talking yeah i would like to propose that start talking about what what does we about streaming what does it mean to stream you know to live stream and they yeah streaming so people can expect us to talk about streaming and about this uh where this 2d versus 3d version topics i think it's something that i would like to to to keep on talking with you because your insights are so uh so yeah very interesting so people can be connected and expected us to talk about 2d versus 3d and live streamings cool thank you for watching for", "r5uCtBlaXzo": "it was one of one of the things that i have to study for my exams was an example of what was it copyrights so now i really know about all that copyright thing in europe i have to learn it by hello like by law like and it was so annoying you know because it was those were i think the most the two most difficult exams that i have this and that was closing my career like because of the last year was that's copyrights and i cannot and because our copyrights in belgium i cannot study that in english right right so then that was really really demanding that because i have to i was kind of like translating to make everything fast but then some of the words it has to be in netherlands you know like because it's the law so i was like oh my god back and forward with the copyrights so but yeah uh yeah so we are recording this uh hello and how are you here happy new year the last time we saw each other was for christmas uh the the last day the new year's eve that was the practice ah yes we did we did yeah we did a session that the the last year and the 31 of december true yeah yeah but the chat was when anyways the the chat was at 23. that was the day before yeah for crazy yeah yeah yeah yeah uh i see that yesterday you put some video like with some glitches like with pixel light with white that was really cool like i'm really looking for where you should make a video or we should make a talk where i can learn what you were doing uh that was really cool the last thing that you made that uh was very cool thanks very cool that was quite complicated um because i mean the first version i don't know if you use i think i only post posted on twitter but that was just making glitches based on the the image that camera is looking at but the last one i posted on facebook or twitter was it was like uh doing some kind of buffering so yeah i didn't understood that because it i was trying to guess like are you using some medical are you how are you changing the position though of the images yeah so that was i mean this is getting really technical but in hydra you only have four buffers right yeah so that's like not enough to make uh like a video loop so i what do you mean with a video loop because it was like playing back like a sequence okay how many how many pieces you wanted to create the loop so in that case i mean let's say if it's 60 frames per second then you need 60 frames for one second loop yeah yeah so you only have four buffers so what i did is you split the one buffer into four by four i think so you shrink the the camera image uh into not quarter yeah like 16 please using 16 blocks exactly and then you place them like uh in a sequence that's there's like a little code that i made so that uh every frame it goes to the next position and then goes to the next row if it hits the end and then you were and then you were using a module or something because it was one you show it was not all the blocks were showing but just the the one aft you know like this one yes this one no this one yes so are you were using a modulo like to show just you know what i mean because you were not showing the whole line but just one yes one no one yes but no in the final image sorry again you mean the final image yeah i mean what i remember is that's yeah when the when the image is changing like it's not changing completely but just uh the blocks the two blocks the order will be around the one in between two or yes you know the whole image yeah like like a chest like as a chest uh yeah board were you using about like a modulo to do that or what or is that a function yeah it's just like uh it's just like a you know if you take module then it will wrap from you know zero one two three and then then zero one two three so it goes like ah so you so you literally no it's because what i was making what i was thinking is you know like if you create this i don't know it's called like modulo so not the module functioning hybrid but module you know when when you have a function and then you reset that you can create yeah and processing something like that uh but no so what you were doing literally was putting one three five seven that's what you were doing right that's what you said you did um i was just thinking maybe i can do screen sharing to try to to try to do that uh okay sure yeah i don't know it becomes a bit technical but let's see oh but it's cool scooby was like that but i feel like hmm like now that i will have some time i will go back to your previous examples yeah yeah also like i should um start doing the the tutorials again because this one in particular this one because i you know what i found this one that is very beautiful that is that is not uh that is very passive uh yeah the image is not so aggressive you know even though it's changing is very melt which is difficult to find i mean uh you know when you when you're glitching normally you go it's normally that one will go in high colors and aggressive changes and drastic changes because of the pixelate but the one that you did it was very soft somehow even though it's very harsh okay so this is the how it looks like so as you can see you know like i'm just like it's all forget about the the last output the glitchy one but the small like mini nail toes i'm just like raising hand and uh just back and forth so you see that it's like feeling from the top left and uh like if i clap then you'll see that this clap is like propagating through the small screens so but then how are you so is all of so these are three buffers right and these three buffers are they are which is the one which one is the first one that is being triggered uh what is the order of this so i think it's coming from the very top left or maybe not it's quite arbitrary actually okay yeah yeah i see it yes yeah okay but then what you do is like then you repeat that uh in the three buffers yeah so the last output from the first buffer will continue to the next buffers first input let's say yeah so it's just like a like a bunch of buckets that you know passing the images image to the next bucket and next bucket and then how then how are you putting how you manage so i understand the image there but then how you manage to put them in the result that you have i mean it's it's a little bit tricky uh where is yeah i think i i think maybe you can do a tutorial in that yeah i should uh take some time to explain it but basically like if i just take the the original output i'm like this yeah in the in the right bottom right corner but then i need some kind of trick well like not a trick but uh i just take the o2 source that's the that's supposed to have the last output uh some somewhere in this buffer top top right is o2 i guess or is it not yes oh yeah anyways so there is like the the last buffer is one of those images that's represented by this variable t t is just like incrementing every frame so it's it's like an index and based on that i just take the small frame out of this 16 images and just like center it enlarge it and if i map it like that then it should become that's what that's what i meant with the modulo so then it's not that t-module of four divided by four is that yeah so that's that's for the x you know it's just like repeating from the left uh second one third one and the fourth one is uh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that's what i thought like it should do some resetting so you're using the modulo to not show all of them yeah and it's more like passing to the next uh position the index right and now i'm just in the in the o3 buffer i'm just showing the very last output so there should have be should be a there should have like a huge delay if i clap wow see wow but that's cool because in this way you control the delay that's very interesting i mean let's say somehow you you have more control of the delay did you clap again right because is it okay so don't move anymore i don't know if you could figure out the delay but if it's working right now with 60 frames per second there should be 16 by three so like 48 buffers so it should be a bit less than a second what of the delay the delay but of course it's not working at 60 frames per second and anyways camera is doing like 30 frames per second so there it has to like optimize a bit i don't know what's what's happening this is cool man uh i would like to to learn that uh some some of the coming weeks i think this is cool uh this is cool i like this thanks i just try to get it like if i do this then half of me in the last buffer or i can just enlarge myself like half of myself is from like i'm talking right now here but um like the the left half or i don't know yeah left half of myself is the delayed one so wow that's very very this is something that i really want to get i want to grasp this because of my this is something that's very interesting because when i'm when i'm working but i have to work this semester it's about uh yeah timing basically like and this is literally this is a good way to you know it reminds me like today i have to to expose a bit of like yeah my yeah my idea to work from the next semester and i found a good example of that is cubism you know because then cubism what what you're doing basically sure sure what you're doing is as you know it is just you're showing all the possible angles at the same time right that's what they're doing and so they compose the perception in one flat image so basically what they do is like they played with time right because you are seeing everything at the same time in one flat image and it's not different than what you're doing i mean somehow like a good way to kind of like play with that idea would be uh i like the the the same i like the scene how simple it looks like because it looks very simple actually and it's not yeah it's complex actually behind the code is complex but normally it says when we work or when you glitch then there's the glitch by itself often is very harsh because of the colors and the nature of the glitch right so this is i found very human some i don't know it's very close to what i would what i would like to put in a performance you know if i have to think in like a dancing body in a let's say performance for real this is more uh i think more uh gives more it's more melt it can melt easy i mean as a audience you can be i don't know like 10 minutes with something like this that things are happening while if you're glitching fast after maybe two three minutes five minutes depends on what you're doing uh you will saturate somebody who's looking at yellows blues magentas all these colors like somebody will get you like um so i think i think this is very nice uh i found it uh yeah maybe it's also that uh it looks like uh you know how the like analog film was you know stored or yeah how it works right like it's it's just basically a strip it's it's not a matrix but uh it's just like you know these pieces of pieces of um frames yeah so maybe that's like that's easier when you see this you know a bunch of small images moving it's like uh you know we can relate it more physically than just like uh digital data i mean it is digital data but you can imagine the representation in an analog form or physically yeah actually that's a it's a very it's a good way to describe that yeah so it's um kind of like but just sorry i'm just putting my notes over here it's kind of like uh shoes and yes kind of like an analog movie and um log image true like in a camera it's true you can see like yeah analog image camera um yeah easy to yeah and i think as well as uh in terms of like let's say a performance is easy to handle you can stay as a public you can stay in something like that for a longer period than because it's not so harsh easy to to stay yeah uh i mean these are my notes that you don't have to agree no no i mean definitely this is something we can explore uh actually i was thinking about something else i mean something related that it was actually a year ago around this time i was working on a dance piece that was basically using the same technique with the delay line and it was more like a complex uh setup and we had like maximum one minute or like even like two minutes of loop we can record while we while the dancers are performing and we can play it back on the projection and i mean technically it was interesting and i was like again like i had this um debug monitor that has like videos from one minute ago two minutes ago and i can you know switch between them but it's i think we need it for time to develop the piece itself because um i mean it was a choreographed piece and like movement-wise as well and it was really hard to like work on the content and play with the the technology at the same time i mean at least for this that uh collaboration it was hard yeah you know what i'm thinking actually um in terms of like the best practice um is that i mean i'm just wondering because of what you said it's like this so cool like just we start talking and then like oh and then like 200 ideas like oh dude so wait is that um because i can imagine as you said uh and and it's yeah that uh it might be messy actually when you start trying to put some uh this is kind of like a proof of concept like it is actually literally an algorithm and that you so it's it's kind of like yeah it's something that's mathematical right so uh so if you're trying to go uh to work with that and make it right you know to put it to set it in the cor in a choreography uh i think i'm i dare to say just uh now in my reflections because is that it might be wrong in a way or more difficult trying to put it perfectly because you cannot count with many variables even though it's an algorithm uh well instead i'm more i'm i'll be interested in in how you get how can can we be you know how can how can we use this as more as a concept as something that is in a totality something that you can in jump do it and get out uh or just take it back when you need it but just as as i mean just as a totality as not more than what i don't know delay it will do or color or one of the other functions just even though this is way more complex uh just as a one object an object function let's say more than just trying to really because you can actually base a whole scene or a really complex choreography in something like this so i think what i see that could be an um as a strength is that if his approach not as something that it has to be perfect feeling something you know what i mean that i mean that's my scene right now reflecting on what you said in your experience yeah i mean basically that's how we do it right it is just yeah yeah yeah but i think i think it's really important like to well not to compare like these uh dance pieces with what how we do it but it's it's always really difficult to connect like like concept wise it sounds really interesting if we talk about like you know using video buffers and relating to analog film but then if you do it then if you practice it it's like something probably like totally different from what you expect and also like there's so many variables that like for example the choreographer cannot change and they have to ask me all the time and i'm not saying that's bad but that will be different from you know working with actual camera and you know changing settings by yourself so like and then in this case like how we do it or how i was doing it with the delay lying was like really fun because i know what's happening and i'm the one that's moving so it's like so fast to you know yeah sorry maybe i will like to make that clear actually because i'm putting my notes and one thing that i like actually that that name like delay line concept because it's kind of i see it now yes you have to really imagine the script of the analog film like one after the other one i really like that one and the second one is that um yeah um that you are uh because you are doing the movement then you understand the constraints so uh you know what are your limits even even though you don't know i mean you know what i mean like it's different than the choreographer telling you what to do but i'm saying this because if i related with my what i'm thinking as well with uh working for this semester in my project is that i had in the beginning i was thinking uh as in my previous uh choreographies the last thing that the things that i have been working the last four years there are spaces so i'm never dancing actually they're just as you know they're yeah just i'm i'm i'm just start i i just dance actually with you like with the last four years that when i do my choreographies i'm not dancing but it's the public who is inside doing something and then when i was researching this this semester i wanted to do something like this but then when i started analyzing the things that i wanted to do and then test with a kinect and with variables then i see like wow okay there's so many things that can go wrong if i'm expecting them to do these things that i said i will just it will be me the user experience guide you know like it's me the one who is going and do the performance first and then after i finish the performance i might create one or two scenes that people can go and do some things but let's say the whole picture of more complex things is me the one who will know what is the image going out let's say you know all these things that you were mentioning and i'm reflecting this because i just had this conversation this morning with my people from the school and and that is very related to one what you're saying it was you the one who was moving right yeah yeah yeah i i get it and i at first i was thinking like um like relating this to like human computer interaction uh i don't know like maybe you also study a bit around it but like uh what do you make of that user experience for example like you know like designing uh user interface user experience i think it's always really like it's like a trap that you want to make it somehow this universal but then that's kind of that that might drop so many features and i think like now the trend for the last few years is more like about working with specific audience and find what's the problem and what they want because if you just assume like universal yeah yeah i think that's like a third wave in hci a human comes to interaction um so that's something but also like um i mean i i'm tired of these theories and then uh also like i relate what you said to um the conversation i had with uh annie a few weeks ago i mean last year end of last year and it was really interesting because she was saying that it's it's hard well not difficult for her but it's like sometimes fine she finds it difficult that she's working with two other um collaborators for the the project she's been doing with the you know zoo and movements because the woman who is based now in germany no she's in wait she's in france i think she's she's she's working with daniel and uh we were uh jamming one day with her no no i don't think so no that was lisa i okay no yeah but but also uh lisa and daniel and uh annie was working together at some point annie i mean she likes to carry bags with a bag with that teddy bear is she like a oriental woman no no i don't think so but i'm confusing annie um she's uh she's um doing the meditation no no no no no no no it's like my more mature woman yeah yeah okay i'm confusing her with uh anyways so so so i had chat with her and what was interesting is so she's doing this zoom uh movements and meditation or contemplation for some time with daniel and muriel but they are like three they all three like they have different um ideas of course and but like really the different directions there they want to explore and of course it's easier if you work with by yourself or like just two two of you and three people becomes you know it can be really hard to agree on the ideas and like what you said uh i don't know if it's directly related but if you start working with yeah like many people then i mean if it's like choreographer and dancer maybe it's a different um different relationship but yeah like it's it's easier to you know find concepts and dig into you know different ideas if you're like smaller group or like yeah by yourself but why you were so you were mentioning her because yeah because she was saying that uh she's been doing that uh like three of them doing uh together and they all have like different directions and she was asking like if i want like jorge and i want to work with someone else and i mean at some point we were trying a bit but at this point like i feel it's better to keep it uh like for two of us at least for now at least for a while because something that i was reflecting i mean that was my my thought after uh node is that there is so much that would that would that i think we should uh experiment in terms of as well of like being sometimes together because that changed the dynamics of things um which i found wonderful in this uh online uh uh platforms like working uh yeah that is possible but they changed so much for this meta exchanging you know it was so different like the the things all those things that i don't know like having a coffee you're just talking all the meta data like what we're doing now for instance things that are not really in the practice it just gives so much ground and base and just actually human connection that is so so so yeah i see it as a metadata that where that if we are proposing motion like so body emotion that just seeing each other and feeling each other is just so so so different so it's so i think there is uh there is so much space as well to still to to experience in that uh sometimes and then because of that as well uh i thought when i came back that that we can do like special editions or something where we invite something or but until we don't really understand what is uh what are the shapes that is taking uh is better than we keep the confusion i feel that we are used to okay we understand that we better what we are doing i mean we understand our our own mess you know what i mean or yeah yeah yeah so until it's not getting a bit more in some directions or until we do that's what i thought that's what i think from time to time we can propose a curatorial process for one performance or something not work towards this this version of something and we can invite some people for that but in between the process i think is more honest if we keep it together because then we can uh expand the yeah try to make sense of what we're doing in between that's my my perception when i think in collaborations yeah yeah yeah i i think so i mean that's that's something i also want to say and um also i think it really helps that we both have like similar interests in a way but not completely the same of course we're different people um that really helps like if we have you know totally different ideas then well probably we wouldn't work like this yeah yeah but i like because for instance just when we start talking then i am reflecting and saying things and then i see i know you know where you start i see when you're like no that's not like that like there are things that and but it's good because uh yeah so this this this relationship already in the in terms of the uh the concept or whatever is what we call this i would like to call it some kind of like this meta information that we do this trying to do something uh you know uh peacemaker that uh you know the annotation tool we tried a bit uh they have another version called peace meta that uh i i don't know like it's probably like it's for metadata or meta version of peacemaker that uh have you tried that what is that for yeah i think it's basically the same thing but it's more like optimized for using the data on like processing or other applications like if you want to create your own like you know visualization or whatever but um but it's okay it seems because what i what i understood from the tool was to work with videos so not for generative uh images then you have the metadata let's say like now we refer to the you know what we talk or more ideas like conceptual things but it can be like motion capture for example or some kind of you know uh like tracking data and if if that's those numbers are streamed to the to your app then you can you know make your particles or whatever so it's not real time but i mean they probably tried to do it real time and probably they did um but um anyways like it's a bit like i feel like they're kind of lost with the the direction or what what the goal is like if they want to make an annotation tool or they want to support these creative people or whatever to make visualizations of dance yeah i think they try to do both and it's kind of a bit like it's a giant project and right now they're kind of going back to annotation for dancers and within the dancers to create content and review the content not yeah the program that's definitely something uh interesting so this is this uh again peacemaker or peacemaker but peacemaker is the one we tried peacemaker or something so on this piece meta is just something new that they have i mean it came after peacemaker too and then right now i don't think they're um i mean they were using it for some of the the choreographic coding labs and they later developed something else like a some kind of data player that you can just download and it will play back the motion capture data and you can get it on osc or something or websocket um so they are definitely working with visualization of dance but it's it's something different from peacemaker that we try to annotate with the text yeah yeah i mean it seems very interesting like it seems like the idea is is very nice but then i started thinking like right away like okay if you work with something like this like i'm sure like depending if i want to use that in something like i don't know touch designer or another other tool then i will need certain protocols and then i'm sure like the motion bank is working they i guess they create the tool and already they know what are the protocols for in between the i don't know the piece uh the piece meta and then the compatible other software or development tool that they're gonna use uh i mean it's it sounds like definitely like a would be cool i mean i imagine like an in an ideal world would be so nice if they could create something that is kind of like universal tool uh where you can store some sort of like metadata about motion capture and then in a way like provide universal uh protocols like for other tools to kind of like just like plug and play like i don't know connect somewhere api download or in different ways like but you know what i mean like in an universal way because i can imagine already like if i don't know what are how are they using they should have those things always they have protocols you know and yeah yeah but this yeah i'm curious to like to to to maybe to check what is how do they use that yeah um yeah i mean it gets a bit technical so maybe i'm gonna stop the topic around this for now but i think i'm i don't know if we ever thought we ever talked about this annotation thing in the chat i think we did at least once or twice but what about the annotation of the metadata we did uh and at some point in the conversations we talked about like is it nes are we ever do we need to work with a motion capture at some point we kind of like briefly we said like are we gonna work with that and we said go fast we said like for now no but we thought like maybe eventually we could do something like that um yeah it's i mean if you move of course will be nice at some point that uh yeah to use something like that well but it's not the focus of what we're doing right now yeah and i was just like this was really interesting because then i noticed that we don't even have the raw footage of the the camera you know like everything is just like the desktop and we never have like a single session with a camera like camera point of view let's say without any effects no but then so what we have uh i guess in one hand what we have both is that we uh we have the the same sort of format in youtube so that that image is the same for both uh once this is there on youtube some the image the yeah it's the same because you are uploading that in the same place in the same way so that that metadata should be different because it's different but it's still yeah submitted in the same way well if we compare i guess the recordings on my computer and then we put it next to yours it might be different so then from starting just from that point of view then it it won't be a match somehow i i mean i'm just thinking no well what i would say is just like you know we don't have like this kind of view of like the like how i look like without glitches or without any program or effects but what we record is just a desktop that whatever we place the the screens everything there is but yeah everything that it comes into the screen that's what you mean yeah yeah and it doesn't show like this exactly this thing always there's code or something on top of it or the effects or some processing happening because i agree because i compared to like what motion bank does is like they're like so obsessed with like different point of views and synchronizing these you know different camera views and different information and then there's also motion capture to kind of add something to it so but what they do in a way like they're purifying the body in the space moving right like in that sense like yeah yeah like they're trying to get as more like pure as possible and and weighs the body in motion in the space well if we compare it then from that point of view then what we do is like we are the devil because then we just it's so dirty when we do it's just smashing everything at the same it's like a huge like a colombian soup [Music] but then i would say japanese hot spot anyways but i like that assimilation because yeah i understand you're like they have a clean what they try to do is they have a good a clean way to uh capture the body motion and then what we do is like actually every i will consider them then other elements will be in motion you know like because if the code move at some point that that will become i mean if you literally just you press spacebar in your code editor that's already part of the motion right that becomes of course of course like i think once i said it but like i really liked how you work with the bdmx because it has like so many windows and it's just like it's another you know i don't want to say choreography it's just like the word i start to hate but it is a choreography and yeah yeah it's everything but another layer i definitely i definitely think that would be nice if at some point we take maybe when we we if we spend some time i guess together then we can say like maybe we can spend one week trying to do something with tools from the emotion back and trying to do something more clean you know uh and see what is the effect of something or doing that well we are so dirty trying to work clean uh that what would would that be yeah we need like incense and like purify our body and i don't know i was thinking that maybe that could be something to consider to maybe apply for the to the motion bank at some point i remember i was talking with the with stefan in node something and then he said uh cool florian [Music] the guy who was in charge of the whole i guess the more the all the streaming i'm really tall this really tall tall guy um so and then he's i think he's teaching interaction designing one of these universities in germany and then he was and he's working uh often then in the things or something with the motion bank and doing things that trying to do interaction design with them and with dancers and then he was saying like yeah but maybe why don't applying for doing something and then like something specific you know like something very specific and i was thinking that maybe we could consider to maybe apply for doing kind of like purification practice or something in between like if we define what we're doing in a way it's like i don't like the word dirty but we do yeah i mean i don't know we need to find a word for that but like yeah the best practices yeah you know like practices that it would be nice actually to put best practices in a call in a in a in a place there is more like a uh how you said in english like zero c rule it's key rule goal you know like when you go to the zero g you know like when you go to the doctor and they have a oh yeah now and now i know that word in the french but uh anyways the one that you're never able to pronounce yeah like my spanish that does the border of my by the limit of my spanish there yeah um but yeah so if you do like trying to as a project to consider like and think and then as well write about that you know like then define okay this is best practices is like that and the hospital or let's say the star regen is motion bank you know with all these clean elements we are covet we are the virus and this is the hospital this is very clean motion and yeah i mean i would say differently but but because i don't think they're doctors uh i mean maybe they have phd but it's it's not that uh like you know it's it's like a negotiation it's not like we ask them to do something but it's it's a constant negotiation that we have to do with them um but that that's really interesting idea and uh i can i can talk a little bit about that in the like behind behind the scenes yeah that could that could be interesting like that like to have this process because i think would be f i think it will be really fun for us you know like just because what we do you know like this is just what we do and then and i i like this element of like putting some kind of a bit of uncomfortness you know like because that's that i mean my intention as a and i see as a positive in that idea is like to bring on comfort or to bring something that is not uh the thing that normally you would work in that in that in that uh in that framework you know like working with but with with motion with body in motion but in the way how we do uh so actually it's putting that place in an uncomfort place which i i think that that is kind of the added value that i see in that proposal is that we bring uncomfort to the place you know like yeah because the way how we approach it is very dirty yeah it's also like really interesting if you look at the the piece that they worked with i think that's that was like the the last one that they worked with is uh with the finnish uh choreographer that the dance piece was just like just like dance like five dancers running around yeah i saw it yeah yeah so that's like you know they they take the pure ingredient and uh make it into like vr pieces or whatever from the motion capture data yeah i'm not saying i'm not judging but you know if if there is like already like a greasy uh like dish coming to the motion bank like how would they take it how would they you know open it up and uh put more ketchup or just like you know find the meat or bones and uh yeah i mean that could be a really interesting thing to do with them although i don't know like they're not they they don't work with like a cons like concepts they're more like hands-on i would say so it may be it's maybe more about you know we we take this operation room and we become the doctor and this well the surge surgeon and uh virgin thank you very much and the patient and the patient at the same time okay great yes so we open up our bodies yeah yeah yeah yeah to be scrutinized yeah yeah yeah but i think yeah yeah i see that i mean if i so i understand so normally what you do like in a research place you know uh in the academia then what you do is you go to these very clean environments right if you're in a phd of this really advanced studies where you become actually when you're doing i have a friend of mine the wife of a friend of mine of elkin if you are saying hello it's like she became i think her phd was about i think she's specialized in understanding banana traits or something like that literally she's like one of the few people who really know about bananas trade somehow it's very specialized it's so stonish i mean from other point of view one person can think like that's so boring you know because this is so niche right but that's what the academia is about that i think would be interesting uh to i mean from that point of view then through makeup performance is kind of boring because as you said for instance you will put the last in that example just people to run around because there are some reasons why to do it and then trying to use the data but from that point of view i think always i was yeah when we the things that we do are i don't know i i never get bored of what we do so i guess it's not really uh fair to speak about from other people but it's not boring because it's changing costs constantly and yeah anyways like to close this chapter i think will be an interesting topic to talk like to propose and to to see to go to a place it doesn't have to be maybe in that place but to another place to try to go to a to the how is the name surging surgeon urgent to go to the surgeon uh with the open body you know with all the back with the things all the things that we have and that would be challenging for us and but as well actually to be honest if we following my understanding what we do is it won't be challenging because just we do what we do and it's always i think we will we are kind of okay if you think for reason the performance but we failed it know it we were like oh like oh no we finished and then after five minutes and we were like and then they were asking us the answer like how was it we like we failed it was great and then but we were happy of the all i mean it's just part of the what we're doing right so i think from our point of view it will be it's okay yeah anyway i think it's uh it's unders i i put it in my notes and and that's what would be good if you at any one we have the time maybe just to mention it doesn't have to be an official proposal now but just okay let's talk about it in the behind the scenes so we close down and uh all right thank you thank you for watching i don't know whoever you are bye", "BTEVv-9A7BI": "hello it's already recording all right you're back live we're back yes nice that was fun it's really fun how was it for you well i think at first i was really it was really hard like you know i have to think about it you know like because like today i didn't quote much i don't know if you saw it but like i was like just so obsessed with the theme that's true i was like constantly thinking about it but yeah and how do you feel about it well it was great like definitely it's it's different type of you know different way of engaging with this one hour yeah yeah yeah it was different no it was different how was this sound because i couldn't hear anything from you and i you know i was missing a bit of that i was missing a bit your sound because even sometimes sometimes i i hear i don't hear yeah i hear something from you because i was not playing the sound i was playing the sound in my headphones but i didn't stream it to you uh the idea but what i mean is like as well like even if i speak yeah like if you speak or if you move forward do you do like this or normally like how you did it today i think i think it was the same but i don't know like because always it's sound on my computer is quite complicated but you could hear me yeah i mean i was muting once in a while but uh yeah yeah yeah yeah but uh but i think it's good because also like at the end we were like you know playing different sound but it's kind of you know working but i think it's cool i think it's cool as long as you know at some point i ask you like do you hear me or something at that moment i wanted to to share the song at that moment so do you hear that yeah also like today i tried to like switch to obs and you know i i still hear your sound like last time i talked about the i don't want to have too many songs in the recording but i at one point i was muting obs to record sound but i was still hearing you oh okay okay which is also possible yeah yeah yeah but um yeah it was it was cool like at the end i was like you know i just shut down everything you were moving a lot like in this session you move a lot yeah like you were doing some you're doing some motion that it was very repetitive you're going in some direction and you know that it was recorded you recorded it yeah yeah i was using two computers and uh no i didn't really expect to do that but uh i was using the main main computer the desktop one but then i wanted to like record movement and play it as a loop yeah so i brought another computer and i was doing it and how you're doing the loop where were you doing the loop somehow i did it i was i recorded the video from the camera and then i was playing back as a loop and using obs virtual cam to play it just like the webcam but i don't understand how you get the loop still well i i record something yeah as a video so you have a video yeah you just play it as a loop on but where where did you play it as a loop in obs you can put as a loop and obviously you can but uh i i didn't actually think about it i was just playing it in vlc player ah okay and then there you keep it there and then i take that as a virtual input obvious ah okay now i understand like yeah how you get the loop okay you put it in blc yeah yeah yeah but you can also do it in obs you can do loops in obs yeah like uh there's like a media source that you can play a video which is pretty cool but yeah um it was great and i was because i i i did that this because it's you know predictable and then i was playing the changing the the playback speed so the move became faster actually yeah because i was at at the end i was i scaled this thing so that my idea was not doing that but he ended up doing it like this i i wanted what like i wanted actually to be a small that's what i wanted i wanted to be a small so i was trying to scale me but then at the end i just have agreed and then i thought okay this is cool and then i thought i will put you there then in the in the grid and yeah that was cool that was cool like to have you there and then just i see you like passing because i multiply you many times so i see you passing in that loop in the loop so i because i was not watching uh a live lab so i just saw that you were doing that you know keep on doing i just saw the saw the loop and i didn't know you were doing a loop so i thought okay that's predictable [Laughter] well but at the same time like i think i was really like uh aware of like something i wanted to do at the end was um i think this is like something in hip-hop like i think neil told me is this but uh you do like so you have three steps like first one then second one is you emphasize the same movement but the last one you actually make it small so that it becomes unpredictable to the audience oh and i was somehow thinking about it i don't know if i was doing it but like they're also like the reason why i was just like staying almost not still but you know just in front of the camera at the end i don't know if you saw it actually but um i thought you were just really tired because when i came back i i came back to obs i came back to obs to uh to live lab just to close the session so it was like i was having like 30 seconds before 10 before 11 so i was just there waiting for that and then i see you are there so but in my my head you were just moving in all the time in my in my screen you were just keep on moving all the time and it was so small i could not really see that it was like let's say you were just doing a a loop because it was just so small it couldn't be just really you doing that all the time [Laughter] no no but actually i was moving a lot but different moves you were moving a lot today that was cool as well because at some point as well you were sitting so yeah that was cool that was cool yeah yeah yeah yeah that was very unpredictable i would say yeah yeah because today i i thought like i will work on the museum thing again not the museum but the the framing saying again like last time we were playing with stuff i was playing with the space and then like this topic was like i mean we could i could work on it but it's more about time also like you kind of wrote something about well maybe you didn't write about time but you know this topic is really more like in the time domain rather than the space the prediction yeah yeah it's it's about oh you just said something about the future no i don't know yeah yeah yeah yeah i said that what was it i said we can watch it right here yeah produce predict the future something i mean something yeah something like that yeah i used to i used to when i write sometimes i will write something that is obvious and at the end i didn't write the last to send two words or something uh yeah but it was cool was cool i was as well using text type because i missed the text between the text editor i use a lot a lot of windows we use a lot of windows this session in live live like at some point we have like eight nine of those things open like i normally use just one switcher i was using two switchers yeah youtube actually yeah that's cool yeah that's cool that's cool uh yeah i like it because it was very it was very simple but like for like a a part of how simple was what i what i was doing like i uh aesthetically what i got was very nice i really liked it at at some point i ended up somewhere and then i thought okay just this is it and it was just a mistake like and then just going to the red and the squares and i really like the yeah it was it was cool it was very nice yeah yeah but i then i couldn't because my yeah so my goal was i don't know if you know what if you saw what i was doing but so there was this there was this greet there was this greed and then so my idea was to have you because you were moving in the in this moles grid but behind i wanted to have not myself but the because it was a karaoke off i will survive so i wanted to have that i wanted to have the just the the frame of the karaoke oh i will survive while you were doing that but i i was too excited and i didn't manage at the end i just saw myself then that okay this works i'm just gonna dance because the word i didn't move just i moved to the last i think six minutes and from time to time i did something but today i didn't move that much but i was yeah you're really like you're really like i don't know if you were coding or but uh i didn't see much yeah i was trying different things yeah i was coding moving things around trying to make things in my head and then like then trying with they were not working but there was a lot in that but it was opposite yeah yeah it did yeah that's true it was completely the opportunity throughout like one hour i think and normally we do it the other way around normally you would be more like into like like changing and then i will spend more time moving i think the last sessions yeah it feels cool yeah but i feel now wait because then i feel okay this is the part of things that we i think that because now i think i'm excited so then as i then like the talk let's say in terms of building up something is not is it's not neutral you know it's like it's because i'm not excited yeah but to be honest i always like i always already feel this kind of you know uh so i was so excited but what was it like i just now i just feel like i cannot articulate that or like i don't even know it was you know like something to share but but i think that's really important because now i'm trying to in a way i'm trying to judge but i shouldn't in a way yeah i see i see i see okay the way i interpret that because i i think already because it's slowly then i'm calming down no so then it's like first reaction is they will send you a message then wow so cool i was i mean even though so this time i didn't finish like hyperventilate because i was not moving that much but then i feel as well i finished like what that was very distressing you know like for my whole day the things that i was doing and stuff like it was completely something like very nice to do you know yeah so and then i finished it just like that but then slowly then now we talk and it's like in a way how i relate is what you said judging in your head i related with i'm saying that yeah but maybe it wasn't so special you know like slowly it just it gets like i'm i'm becoming more still and coming back to myself you know like i even took i normally i'm not drinking so late i even i make a porto porto drink cocktail this is a porto tonic cocktail that i learned to do it in puerto porto like three years ago that i never drink it i have a bottle there and i was like oh my god this is a good i need to drink something special and i make a cocktail so salud well you should have used it with the green screen it's so way way because i think maybe some is called from something that we are talking is i think this this is this is the flow no i mean that's flow no um yeah this is just flow because in a way and just be doing something just if the time passes and it was very very so i i feel very soft but i think it's somewhat different because from what we talked about like uh like flow is really like when you don't really question you know you don't get um aware of what you're doing but today i was really like conscious conscious about you know what i'm doing and what i want to make but at the same time like it's it's fun i don't know how to explain it but also like it's kind of you know feeling that i might ruin everything by doing something but so i have to be kind of it's so delicate but at the same time i have this joy yeah yeah yeah that's that's that's how i feel that's my relation with code and and my my yeah my my doing my learning my trauma with code is because i'm i think it comes from dance because in dance as choreographer or what you learn if you study ballet and stuff is just you learn to be a freak control no control freak with time and space you just you are like you want to control everything i remember when i worked with visual artists in performances so let's say if i do a performance my approach it comes from time space and this the approach from a visual artist when i one of the first times when i was doing that their approach is very conceptual and just on the on the with the material basically because that's what they learn you know to work and transform the materials and for me like so if we work together remember that we spent some time and i was going crazy trying to calculate everything and for the performance and the guy was just like it was completely different so the relation of that is different so i think as well when when i'm working with coding and many times like then i'm just i don't know sure what i'm doing i'm i'm very afraid to do the things wrong so you know to just to to just grow write wrong the code and then i and then because of that then i will keep thinking too much um like you know how should it should be like today i was not doing that like because yeah and then i was more relaxed i was just like moving sometimes numbers and from time to time then i will think trying to make sense like okay but yeah so it was more organic that process uh yeah yeah you see to me it's it's more about like the the idea today like you know like i try some kind of idea like one is you know work on the floor or i record something and then it's i mean obviously like what we do is like not about judging like i don't it doesn't matter if this idea doesn't work or you don't like it or i don't like it it doesn't matter but you know when i try it actually i'm really like afraid of it you know if it's going to be like interesting to put the camera like but it feels to me like as well in what we talk if we refer i i think i found very interesting this because if we if i compare with few weeks when i feel uh we were like developing basing and release uh conceptual structure and building up if i compare with now like now i'm not taking notes i'm just drinking my cocktail and quite just being relaxed i'm thinking that um i feel as well the way how we are talking that we are more flexible uh in whatever you need to be flexible then normally you don't give your space for being flexible and then myself uh for me in my own experience in for what i'm not flexible nor normally in my in the practice like for instance like you were doing things that normally you wouldn't do you know like like sitting and you were but and those things as you said like regardless of if they were good or bad you feel okay from from doing them so you are very you were you were allowing yourself like to get out of from places that you know and nothing much right i think i think what i'm trying to say is like i think it felt very flexible that we both are are getting more flexible in the frame you know because still we have is i mean instead we are not getting out it still is framed we use the same things there is hydra live lab today with 18 18 squares but it's still but then from there then we are just i think you remember but you were referring at some time with what martin says about the tools or what was it about about the about limitations of what yeah yeah you're referring constantly about something that he said that in my head painting what yeah paintings yes in the museum or yeah paint in the bucket yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i think it's very i mean i feel that it's very very cool yeah yeah i i don't know if this is like directly related but um yeah i think it's good that like i i had some ideas today on the spot obviously it's not something prepared but um yeah we had like a room to try it and i i would really regret if i didn't try these ideas and it's yeah i i think it's it's really good that we have a team so it's not like a progression with hydra and something we already have but you know i mean we used it but in a different way yeah because i i have a fear that you know like as we do this practice i feel like starting to kind of trying to be the master of hydra which is not obviously not the not the um objective of this but i start to feel like okay i can do this cool effects but then what is it yeah but i think it's cool i mean i i i don't know i can't i can't can i speak from for from what i can experience from your side let's say uh with the tools and and i feel that you're more flexible and more you're more relaxing that's what that's what i what i perceive you know like if you are two like yeah the the feeling that you give me through the doing is more accessible for me uh yeah yeah yeah and it's not because you are not doing because like let's say the last few times you were like doing let's say less i mean less less glitches or less something more complex i don't think it's because of that but it's just because the way how you go you know the way how you feel how you just you go like the intention that you put on and it's cool because like still you go and you're in your thing but you have a reference you know when when i ask you hey now to you there you you you're back you know for yeah yeah so it's very it's very yeah in a distance because this is a distant uh position um it feel i feel more engaged like more yeah more more like if you are more if you are like if you are here it feels more real yes i think that's the word it feels more real to me i see yeah it's also like really strange as a you know if i think back of what i was doing during the practice like i felt like i was really in my bubble and felt like i'm not really looking at your video or using your video or you know but if i think back i really feel that i was like constantly like checking what you're doing and it's not necessarily like i'm using your material but it's also like a bit i don't know i feel like i'm afraid of everything but i'm afraid that you know we kind of miss something by yeah i have the same feeling that's weird that's something that i have to say that i that as well i'm sharing because even though i feel very gay at the moment very happy you know uh like gay as happy um then i i have this this fear there is some fear there there is there there is a this fear that like yeah yeah it's like and but it so it's not it's not like something that is taking over what i'm doing uh but it still is there like uh maybe i should put you you know yeah it's like this maybe because it's true like today i i didn't use a lot of you just at the end because i wanted you to dance and i have a concrete idea why to put you there but before i think for maybe 40 minutes that where you are not there but if if we talk like really literally and comparing the other practices that changes for practice to practice because that's the whole point with the practice we don't know what we're doing and so i think this uh yeah this i just agree with what you said there is i feel identified with that i should something in relation with you you know because it's different yeah that's different that's different than the things that i that i have to handle with what i want to do you know like my ideas my creative ideas but what i'm trying to say is like this fear or this i should involve you in my frame is there yeah yeah yeah yeah i think that's that's that's what i want to say and but i think it's also coming from you know kind of feel responsible in a way because we are spending the time together and you know it's we all you know we both want to do something good and i don't i'm not saying that i don't want to ruin it but because we are both here for each other it's it's there is some kind of responsibility but that that doesn't mean that i should do this way i shouldn't do that way yeah but i completely i i understand what what you said he's like and this is really strange i mean not and strange means that it's alien to me like it like it can happen when you work with someone but i don't know if this happened to me before maybe because it's because of this format we do that we meet every week but one hour and that's that's starting to create something that i i never encountered i think i think but the word you said is is very appropriate but you said like there is some but it's very cool because i feel like respond responsible you know like there is some shared responsibility in something that is cool you know something that is it's fun yeah and you know what i'm thinking there's a bit weird because i'm trying to think like what if all the other person will just hear uh check this this this conversation is that i know what you mean about this fear that what this i should i know what he means even though he's not completely articulate and what i'm trying to articulate as well i'm not i cannot express completely what it is so i understand i mean i understand what you're trying to say i relate uh from what you're saying but i'm just thinking that maybe it's because just now we we know each other and we speak this language then if other person from outside will try to just come and see i'm trying to think like what the these people are giving water the is wrong with these people well i think we say something rational but but it's something has to be experienced yeah i i don't know i'm not saying that we we are we are special but because we are doing this that we experience this practice and that's something it's like it's a new emotion that we have so yeah it's something that we can explain somehow that you know we've been doing this practice and you know we have to share the responsibility and blah blah that people can maybe understand but it's something that they have to experience like really the feeling that i was having today for instance yeah it's very similar out the feeling that i will get when i'm very very excited in a party you know like when i'm when i'm dancing and i'm very yeah when i'm drunk actually you know when i'm really when i'm drunk then i'm uh and i'm easy like more ex more out more ex more out more extroverted and that's the feeling that i got like for instance today and it's so cool that then i can just jump in the practice and then i can just party for one hour you know like just like get out of my head uh for one hour uh it's amazing uh yeah therapeutic very therapeutic yeah yeah yeah yeah but that's that's that's something i i also wanted to i i don't know i thought about this like a while ago but i think i never shared but um one of the the my favorite workshop dance workshop i've done is something that we try to become animal we we get naked and we're dancing like it's really crazy um but like from this experience like that workshop i always think you know that was this really special moment that i want to do it by myself but i cannot recreate it because the choreographer i mean the the you know the workshop leader and other people they're in you know we have this kind of some kind of agreement of what we're doing and we create really like gradually create the space for one hour two hours three hours and then that's where we get and it's not something that i go to a studio and i can just do it by myself oh maybe i can come closer but it's it's really hard but when i do the practice like especially at the last 10 minutes it becomes something like that you know that it's just maybe that's something interesting to talk like what does it i mean then what does it mean like the last the last the last 15 minutes what what what are those minutes because like even though like what i experienced is like even though i'm doing whatever it is that i'm doing every single time that it changes the last minutes i is like the way i see it is like that's the time that i feel in one hand i have to go crazy uh uh somehow it's like i feel like already we agree that with the last time the last moments just we danced a lot but more important as well is like a compromise with myself like to get out of the computer you know like if i failing what i was doing or whatever it is that is not working just leave it and just move like at node like a node yeah yeah yeah yeah like the last part of node exactly right like like that crazy you know like that like going like bananas out yes that's a good example yeah like i was so stressed that everything was not working and that was crazy at some point i started jumping yeah i think it's also that something that we like already share as kind of you know our nature that you know it just works somehow yeah yeah perhaps i don't know let's let's stop here yeah yeah but uh yeah so maybe did you stop already no yeah not yet okay so wait let's let's do this let's let's let's write let's read one one paragraph of this before we close what was it this predictable unpredictable expectation 107 right yeah i'm good at numbers 107 yes 107 okay said predictable and unpredictable expectation what is predictable must be both predictable and unpredictable and what is unpredictable must be both unpredictable and predictable that says anything that just says the same yeah i wrote it on the screen you want to read one thing just choose one thing from from that page yeah that would have been something like this also [Music] yeah i'll just read one paragraph there you go expectation in the absence of narrative assuming for the moment that we have none then other factors come into play that determine whether or not the audience still cares what happens next do the audience care because this is actually this is actually some oh yeah that's uh we'll we'll having the behind the scene so bye", "7ud_36m4jb4": "okay recording live from new york this is saturday night live have you watched that sometimes no i i have this thing for from time to time i get addicted to things and and that's close action that's when i'm in bed because then normally at some point per year with the change of seasons i will i end up in bed at some point this uh this change this year hasn't been so strong okay uh but that's why that's why i think that like when i told you that maybe one week ago that was between the school and i was a bit like in that period but so then in the last years at some point when i'm in the bed then i i start getting watching something and youtube live but non-stop like literally from 18 16 hours every year i will do it with something so the last year was like with saturday night live you know what is that it's like a tv show in america there is very famous for humor but the thing is on youtube the things that they show are sketches they are maybe two minutes three minutes long so if you really want to watch them all it's just like you need to just do nothing else than just being in bed and just so then yeah anyway so that was the introduction anyway okay how are you man good um i i am just today i was using my computer all day which means on my standing desk so i'm just sitting now i mean on the floor because it's just i'm tired of standing because your computer is you don't see it when you're working on your lap i mean it's good because uh for the practice it's so practical yeah of course and so but then and as well before when you work with your service as well so your your table is is to stand it it depends like for my desktop computer i i have to use my standing desk because i have the monitor and keyboard and mouse but with surface these days it became like a thing that when i use surface that's when i want to sit on the floor because i mean i don't have a proper desk sort of say and uh also like i don't like the idea of sitting on a chair and you know working uh on a desk yeah this is me like now my my back is killing me man this is not good for the back yeah and wait but then so it's like in your new apartment you have like a kitchen table or something like that i mean i bought a proper standing desk i mean it has the wheels and you can move it around i mean i don't do it that way but it's not that big i think it's like 80 centimeters wide and so basically it's just my computer monitor it's standing on like it has two levels the higher level it has higher ones of course in the back which has the monitor and then uh the closer one is the keyboard and mouse and it's just 80 centimeters wide yes so it's not it's not a lot i cannot like work on two computers for example or i cannot have notebook it's it's really small this is 80 centimeters it's not that long because i have a table somebody give it to me like but it's an old one but it should be is it's like two times long years so it's a big table and it's uh it's a good table but so it's big but yeah you have to see it and i was what i did what i did at some point was i was putting some yeah something to have my computer here with some boxes i did it yeah i see but it's not the same i mean i mean yeah it's like not stable something will follow um ho ho ho i thought you were doing uh some practice like some flow jam with the floor and olivia i saw just the pictures how was that experience okay how was that experience so okay so wasn't was in full confluence no it was something else so basically uh that was on thursday right we did the practice after yeah you did it you so you were you're doing you were doing a jam for more for two hours in a row then almost yeah because we did one hour of you know between us and then i think when we finished that was they just started to do some tests with the network so basically hydra itself has a feature to send video to someone else and you can receive it from someone else but then like you like the thing you're made like the thing that you're doing yep i really this doesn't if there's a new feature no it's been there but like i don't know if it's always working sometimes like i tried and then it was not working but now it's working so that's why like like a screen record screen recording so you you record your screen and you're sharing that screen yeah wow and you receive it as a as a you know like camera or something like i don't know if it's s0s1 or something else but yeah you could receive it from someone else and then but it's tricky because you know if you if you're using live lab for example we always have the grid myself and your video and you know my share screen but if you do it with hydra you don't have that option you just receive it in a buffer which is you know you render but if you put the render then you can see it in which of your render is can you uh you have to put it in one of the buffers like oh zero to o3 and i don't know what's sent to the other person maybe it's the whole screen i don't know actually because the thing that is rendering is not the buffer but the output no that's the output the four outputs poor output yeah so you have to you have to kind of you know patch someone's feed to one of these outputs yes i understand but then still you need to know which buffer is it and you don't know but i mean by heart you don't know where it's coming yeah i mean so it's not like it's not really visual you have to know what's happening inside the code and you know which is connected to some who and you know which buffer you're using it's it's not so intuitive and it's uh but it's actually funny that we were not connected uh we are only connected through hydra so we don't speak to each other like there is no audio like there's no zoom or there's no jitsi light lab so we're just doing it um we're just receiving the video and just jamming with that which was quite interesting because it's so different from what we did ah okay but so then but then you were receiving the video of one of them or two you can get both yeah but then you need to know and then you need ah because i saw some pictures so i guess if you because you put them in some window then you will see then just you see separate the images right yeah like i was just putting in my background yeah like if you mask something and put there yeah yeah yeah i was yeah that's just like cropped and put it in my background two of them like they're like circling yeah yeah yeah okay cool interesting but we should try that one day yeah and that was like so basically i was so tired when we did the uh when i did the jam with uh olivia and floor so i was just reusing most of the things that we did in the yes hey you know what i think what i think i think one thing that that is cool um i think it's amazing is the um the picture that you put of the museum uh and i remember some time ago when like months ago as well you put something in the nasa or something there was some ah that was the uh what was it called space spacex i think we had the launch like there was a screen of one in some spacecraft and i mean i think these things are cool i think those things are very cool because are very flat you know so it's easy to hack so yeah yeah yeah but but what i think is more cool what i found that cooler is because well i know you so is that and is that that's super simple right what did you put the two of those up what is that so i this is a photo i took like long time ago in the museum and then i put the two hydra buffers inside that and this is happening in hydra and this is something i just started but i feel it's really fun i mean it's the same thing as the the space spacex or whatever cockpit but basically it's just deforming the image and put it somewhere in the in the photo and but that's how you put it in before but then how how you're doing that actually are you doing that in hydra this time so it's same logic but this time i'm doing everything inside hydra and i made an uh custom function to deform uh you know screen into some you know deformed one and then you have to like calibrate but you're just like until you get more or less the shape yeah but the calibration i do it in the other software that i just made i mean not a software it's just simple sketch but i in that program i wrote i click you know four points to you know define where the box is and then that creates um matrix like nine array of numbers and i just copy it paste into hydra with the custom function i made then it it becomes that shape so it's a little bit you know um still quite complicated to use but i think it's it's quite interesting and because this is something i started think about because of the the curatorial process that we talked about you know right and last time actually last practice was super interesting to me because this was the first time i didn't use feedback it's true man it's true i was like it was happening i think i was kind of bored with myself like i mean i found myself after i finished that i feel that i was masturbating with the in the way how i was doing things i feel that i was very because in the previous two i felt that we were uh they have a good connection and at this time i was happy but when i finished i felt like i think i i don't know where where i mean i just it feels empty i felt empty i felt different than the last previous but two did you see the did you watch the video after that no i haven't it's really interesting if you especially when you watch it side by side two together it's i really liked it and um okay it's the music thing is something i also want to talk about but uh if you watch two together you should mute mine because mine is rather boring and you should play your sound from your video but i mean but i think what i like from from this sound or is happening now no okay so yeah i think it's i think we have we're having different dynamics now and it's cool because um yeah so i will i will i will feel you more like yeah so even though like the last time that i was doing my thing i will be more consciously being naughty let's say sometimes like between and be friendly so like there is a there is a real interaction that where is very similar how will happen if i will be dancing with you uh improvising with you in so let's say one of my because one of the elements that i have in somehow now is the audio somehow then i will or i will mute you or i will put things that are just in my head of yeah i think there is a i'm more fluid and the way i perceive is that there is more more fluid the the way how i yeah how i go through how i jam within the elements but at the same time i was thinking that maybe because the second time that i'm not using a bdmx of course i'm really i'm really loose no so i'm not so stressed um but then that something is bolder is that i was missing the last time there could be it was just in my head then because of maybe i was not using more things i yeah yeah i don't know you see yeah but anyway so but you were saying you were saying thanks sorry i think i just caught you what you were saying no no i mean uh just to continue on that like i think i was like last time i was really trying to develop something like insa in my bubble i would say i think that's why like we didn't have so much connection because i think i had some clear ideas on what i wanted to work on one is the territorial process which you know i made explicit frame of the your image and something else in my background and i was you know in that and it's still start to feel like it's actually a space like now i'm using the photos of the museums but before that in the practice i made this you know um i don't want to say psychedelic but kind of uh space in my background and this is like a spoiler for you but if you watch videos from the recordings at the end like the last uh five or ten minutes i was just showing you instead of me i think i saw i think i saw something because that's so i mean i think that's very cool day i think we are like now what you're talking in a way is that yeah i think that's very i don't know how to describe but just that conceptually and our i don't know how to describe but the fact that then you yeah then then i'm part i'm the one who is in your screen completely yeah and i was dancing in the background yeah yeah yeah yeah so yeah yeah like i was like at one point like that's crazy but i think the sound was recorded but like you because you're like you know almost like hiding me because you're coding like close to the computer yeah that was i think that was really interesting you know what because sometimes i i don't know if you notice but there's sometimes what i do is that i do the same but just getting away and then i just leave my computer alone sometimes but it's the same intention and then i'm just watching you from here you see i do that then i i left you sometimes there like that uh or i will be here sometimes just watching um yeah that happens when like almost at the end i will be doing that sometime which is quite well i mean maybe maybe similar similar effect but different intention i i would say i was about to say the opposite i will say that the effect is different but intention is the same okay wait let's try to articulate that because i think that what my intention in a way is like i'm giving you space for you to be in here so that's my intention like when i do that it's just i want i want i want you to be there it's like it's like it's like if you're dancing kind of like in a circle that is like now it's your turn because this is my space and i do the solo and then you do the solo i don't know how so that's my intention so let's see how you see it here no i think why like i said intention is more like how i engage with it you know like because i was putting yourself your image in the foreground but i wanted to dance you know but that's it i think we're talking about the same thing but just you know intention in different layer or level yeah yeah or more about like method and you know the reason behind it okay anyways but wait wait and then but yeah how is your experience when you work when you because the last time you tried well with floor and the last time we tried this this jam with olivia and floor and how do you how is your experience how to explode how to say like like they are more used to the like the of of the software more than myself so i like the last time for instance like what i was doing is i would start trying to do some other things and then in the middle and at some point i thought like i was just getting stressed and not enjoying what i was doing so i thought i'm just gonna stay with from from what i have and then i will just change the things that i have from my code um and yeah so in that sense is limited uh in the things that yeah but it's limited the things that i can do for myself because it's still always because it's still that's something that is still surprising because it's because i was trying to put more things in top like things that i completely don't understand but then i was trying to play with it and and it's still so when i erase them and then i just put them something basic even if even when there is still something basic and then i just keep on moving the things in certain way there will be always kind of like endless effects that i will get because then i'm moving as well so it's not only the screen but it's just this feedback or is myself so there will be a lot of resources that i can just use from there to enjoy and then um but then what i was trying to ask is like uh when you jam with them for instance like they know way better that so they are more in uh in a level close to you like on things to do with the software and so how was your experience doing that with them i think i think you said you said it like i what i felt was that like even i felt that they code a lot like in a like that's how they work you know like it's about constantly changing something and you know doing something with code but then i felt i'm more like i just do something and then just let it do it do its job for some time and i'm just in the background doing stuff because i i i want to you know enjoy and you know feel it and then and gradually i start to think about okay maybe this is interesting to add so i come back and code right but i think for them it's more about it i think it's more quick for them to change the code yeah yeah interesting interesting yeah but but i think like the going back maybe to i think it it really it changes my the dynamics since we met because i really like that that's for that's really that's really clear um yeah the way the whole day how the practice go yeah can i say something about the music sure please i just um so obviously i think it's obvious that i mute you quite often and that's and that's just because um you know youtube tells you that you're using this song you're using that song if you play like pop music and they tell you but how you and i think oh like if you upload if you upload they tell you that you know there's copyright whatever and also i think if you open the video it shows the list of the you know the tracks that you're using really they yeah they they really track it they they really scan everything and find it out what is that like in the i want to see that and that's that's just the the only only reason that i'm quite like you know um not nervous but i don't want to be um using too many songs although i i like it to um dance with it but this is true man i just see it now i'm seeing now that oh yeah sorry like i was like oh yeah you can really see it there yes i don't know if they add like um ads on the video to monetize for those artists i don't know but i just feel that's kind of strange so that's why like i try to you know cut your sound if you play music but i mean it's also okay i mean you know yeah i just wanted to say it that that's my intention one of the intentions yeah i mean it's okay for me it doesn't change anything for me i will still put sound sometimes from time from time to time yeah because well sometimes it's like sometimes i use the last time was something about carl jung because it was in my head some two weeks ago was about trump because it was about elections so it's all things there because i cannot some that's something because i cannot use the text i mean directly in hydra then is that then i will just there's some way to communicate something i guess in my head yeah but i i understand what you're saying and understand what you're saying and then anyway as well i i mute you as well sometimes this is good yeah yeah this is what we do exactly this is what we do this is what we do maybe maybe next time i i mute you all the time from the start to the end but then we have to make like you make something like yo you need to make some some some signs like if there is some yeah always there is what's up you know in case that like you need to say something like what's up and uh yeah i also like i i wanted to talk about like you know curatorial process because i just like last time was really interesting because i don't know if that was intention or like maybe i just saw like a music video with you know a bunch of monitors like old you know tvs that are showing you know different videos namjoon pike kind of you know thing that and then i was i was thinking okay maybe it's something easy to do in hydra so let me just do it and that was quite interesting you know how i frame it and then also that relates to the mozilla hubs the greenhouse we're using during node like that was quite a lot of work to put everything together but i i just started to think that that's like sorry wait where was like in the mozilla hops so i'm just comparing two that we did like the last practice and mozilla hubs because last practice was like easy for me like i can also like change things like on the spot but if we do it in mozilla hubs then it's quite limited in terms of you know we need another computer to have the the camera moving or you know you can do only one screen share from you know one computer so you cannot have like bunch of images unless you put it beforehand and in general like i kind of feel a bit you know overwhelmed always to work in like 3d computer graphics so that's why also the museum thing i started to do is just i feel it's more comfortable to work with and yeah what what i think this is good i mean maybe there's something but it's personal that is a that i like from that thing it's just an annotation is that it looks bad not perfectly made if it looks perfectly made it's not good no it's not working but because it's like almost almost fitting in the in the place i know i know you it i don't know it just is good because of that it is at the edge of being good and bad and so that that's what it makes it makes it very good i think so and what you mean like the museum thing with the photos yeah when you put the photo when you put the photos the way how they look is like you can see it's almost there but not perfectly so the same time looks like kind of easy you know like you can do that in photoshop it gives a lot of underlining things you know like i know you so you can i can imagine you're doing trying to do that different different ways and things but i think that's to think about it yeah i think that's really a good point because if i want to work with 3d like modeling then you know if it's a bad 3d model which i always do then it's it's really bad it looks you know it's just bad and um so i think yeah i don't know like how to say but uh it doesn't have to be like like photorealistic 3d scene to do it but um like in a way how i record if i can interrupt you yeah in a way how i see it is close to i think one way we were talking about this idea of faking in performance so do you remember uh so i mean like in real time versus like like making this this idea of like when you put a dancer to to to sh to fake that it kind of uh like fake they're faking them no wait the example was like in a choreography then i put a a sculpture to dance so he had to do a to do a a dance piece so do we dancing and because he's not a good he's not a dancer professional dancer let's say he will do it the best that he can do is still not professionally dance so it's that's kind of the faking uh you know that's not true that's not true because he's not faking the faking will be if i put the sculpture to dance in the dance piece then he will just do the best that he can he's not faking that but and the faking is very complex because then if i want to call a dancer to pretend that he don't know something that he knows that's that's one of the things that people are there are a few people who are very good in that but this is a very difficult thing to do yeah when you know something and kind of like yeah since it's the idea that i have in my head when i see that the image of you gives me this connection of faking you know like the this faking something that is like you're doing your best uh and it's so it's not perfect but it looks good i mean it's in that in that in that atmos atmosphere in some i think somehow this makes sense of what i'm saying okay well i don't know if i'm doing my best or faking but um but i think it's it's really important that like because we're not making you know realistic environment where actually you look like you're here or you know you're yeah you i don't know like but we're not doing that you know it's it's more fun if it's looks fake because because why um i don't know if it's a matter of just style or is it actually something that we're trying to manifest actually i don't know yeah for me that's why that's what i'm saying that's what i was trying to make like the uh to clarify that for me because i know you like i i know more or less what you're doing then then it gives me a lot of space for me to think how you did that you know because as well i'm constantly i'm kind of yeah that's the cool thing that unconsciously i'm criticizing you you know because it's not perfect if it's perfect i will just it's like when you put nice images in youtube and facebook or anything then that that i will just think that's cool that's very cool so there is not space for me to think more than that but when you put something that is not finished you know when it's like that is like these things then it gives me different things that as well like they come unconscious like one of those is like i will unconsciously criticize you because it's not very good and that's what it becomes and that's what it is that's what is i think it's so rich i think is in that point where they they just flat to the picture image become like an artistic something because it just opened so much possibility but that that's like also like related to the idea that like why i was you know doing that kind of style last time was you know like because of these uh pop like music video thing that you know like they have they have like effects that are quite common like you know i was also doing this rgb shift thingy in the last practice and that was also you know one of the things i wanted i think it's like really at this point it's really cheesy and yeah like when you're like you're separate when you're separating the image in three and then coming back yeah and that's but i think it's also interesting because when we do it in hydra it's not it won't be perfect you know like the image is not crisp and the color is not as good and it's it feels like fake you know in a way and that's i think that's interesting like i was trying to think like why is it like this and why is it you know like why i cannot make an image that looks like um like music video for example but um i don't know like but it also feels like i don't have to make it super perfect like you said yeah the only thing that i'm thinking now is no maybe not just better i think we just do the the practice on thursday thursday i will have a day like i will be non-stop from eight to eight um but i think i want to do the the practice the last i did it like that two weeks ago as well and like today for reason i have been working the whole day with this i did something very stupid i was working the whole day and this the full stack javascript thing and then i put the git ignore or something i put i didn't put it in the place where the models were and then i pushed the whole thing and they they didn't my files were not pushing and somehow they were raised in my computer and i was like oh but still i have them all in my in my visual studio that were there as deleted in the in this so i just you see what i mean so it's somehow when i push it and then i see my repository it's just somehow i think it's because i put the uh get ignore out of them where the root of the models i think it somehow i push just the models so what i did the opposite i pushed just the models and the back end and the front end were gone and i was like i was working like six hours in that and i was like no and then i checked but i think they were in the in the visual studio they were as deleted so i see all the code and then pasted somewhere and my man so anyway so that was my today and it was stupid because then that was the something that i'm doing again this year and uh so i thought i'm not kind of following that class but then i anyway i what i was trying to say is that i was working the whole day like i'm going crazy with this thing and then i thought at some point this this the conversation now i mean you have no idea one hour and a half how crazy was i man like bananas like i go really crazy and so this is really the i really like the it really breaks the the day for me it's like we're doing the dance session yeah like the the talking after the the dance session talking after dance talking after the contemporary dance workshop oh yeah yeah yeah but something that in a way i it's how i feel now a bit is that i'm kind of missing as well like i don't really have like right now i'm not taking notes for instance um i can kind of like miss that but at the same time i'm overload with other things so i've just wanted to just talk yeah i mean it's recorded that's for that reason yeah so somehow at the same time kind of missing the the building up in my in my in my head of my notes my concept like how things uh are going but anyway maybe we can go back to like the what do you think about the curatorial processes yeah i mean i think it's lacking the like content at the this point i'm just trying you know trying ideas but it's not like i don't have any like i don't have any you know where i want to go with this what if we because i was thinking that what if like the maybe next practice we can uh choose one word or one one word the thing and and then we can work on that in the in the practice we can just try it uh because i have been doing this with the group thing yeah that's what i thought i really liked the thing because i mean at the beginning i thought okay maybe i will just do it why not but then as they as the days come because i'm not dancing normally i i really enjoy doing that just for 30 seconds like whatever and actually it's really nice for me to see that even though i'm not exercising like i mean i study dance for many years and so i'm not practicing like every day as a dancer will do and i still i will see that my body has a lot of information like if there are different words and then i will answer differently so i'm kind of like i really enjoy it i'm trying to use it like i'm really enjoying the exercise of just doing that and maybe i was thinking that we can try our uh just something like one word yeah i think we could just pick the the that day's word but it could be nice like just to have just like uh like for instance like now because it's an example because there is a list of these things of the of what we're doing in remember so they're 30 words so let's say first and you don't know the numbers so then if i if you say one number then we the number that just you select is the okay so so we choose it at the at the beginning so we don't know so what we mean oh yeah we don't know in advance it's just like at the moment then we know and yeah and actually maybe what we could maybe could be more interesting since we both had a book of the choreographic handbook we can just like or you or me then just we flip it and we stop it somewhere and then just we try to to do in what is it there and see what happens yeah and we should have the common one right yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that definitely thing i think definitely and the last time that we were thinking that we were talking because now i'm thinking the last time that we talked we were talking about time and then we talk about time that we get we get we we spend like 30 minutes talking yeah like nonsense and it makes sense at some point i know and you were gone for some time what was so cool that when i came back like because then you said like get checked out then i check it afterwards it was so cool it was really cool yeah that's about the time yeah yeah yeah yeah cool yeah so actually it's really interesting because this curatorial process thing i'm really into it right now but it's about the space i mean it can be you know something about time as well but it's more special thing so yeah i think it's a space or stage design stage is that i really like my stage this time it's amazing um [Music] i was thinking that yeah i think like now i'm trying to let it fluid like more because if i start thinking things that i would like to do because i feel i don't have time then i feel stressed i don't want to feel stressed yeah i feel like oh maybe we should maybe we should do that at some point like because now i'm trying to i'm working with notch these kind of things will be interesting to try to one time like trying to put what we do in our very realistic and you know like you know like because this is very flat so what if we put what we're doing like i don't know if you put like one of these 3d objects and and then there's the the somehow that we use the the lighting of the 3d object uh that is let's say coming from streaming the videos you see what i mean okay like you see what i mean like if yeah if it's like this is the this is the object and then we are let's say in a two-dimensional image here so it's like a bright screen it's like we mean it's like we illuminate the object from what we are doing yeah like so make you in a dark room you like basically we stream that in a dark room with a bright screen but do it in virtually exactly yeah yeah yeah so then i think this is the thing it's called like hashtag air eye these images that you use that basically is just a picture of the sky and then you use those pictures to illuminate the 3d objects yeah somehow like reflections and stuff yeah so then they we use somehow like the image of what we do into i don't know a 3d model of your face of my face or it's just like something that when you start thinking about that i thought like could be nice to do like to use media servers to do something like that but yeah i will have time for that next next semester i will uh i will have just to do one thing for my school so i will have time to check and be more secure about things yeah yeah i mean i probably that's not what i would do but uh for this creatorial process thing i think i will start to you know like build up something outside the practice because you know i have to prepare images have to prepare this distortion and stuff like that so i i'm not you know preparing like the whole thing but i might bring in something that i prepared in advance but within hydra but could be also it's something we can think that could be also like you know it's like a if i put if i literally put a piece of if it's about the space if i literally put like a piece of paper in front of my camera then i will just that that will if i put a triangle literally let's say i'm masking my camera with a with a triangle literally then but then my then my space did you see my did you see my paintings in which paintings no actually i used i started to like paint a little bit like it's it's really stupid but um and then i noticed that if i make the background green then i can use it with chroma key so i really like something that i started did i start uh experimenting the last two sessions it's just with green colors oh yeah you were wearing the green t-shirt but i was like holding like something painted in green but it has something in the middle and yeah i think this is quite quite fun and uh i'm starting to prepare a little bit of those i'm not prepared but i i just started to feel like i really should paint because it's so fun you know like and i like uh actually that was because of node like when i was you know doing this um cardboard with uh drawing you know the uh the tech is non-binary that yeah yeah yeah yeah the the protest thing and that that was like i because i think there was no brush like paintbrush like everything was used and i didn't want to clean them so i just started to do with my fingers and that was really fun like it's a bit like you know i mean i don't want to say everything choreographic but it's uh you know well not choreographic but maybe it's an embodied process and i think i think like if i ever we can think of that is like whatever is it comes in your head like maybe we can do it consciously next time like as a curatorial process you know like like like for instance like now like this thing has been there the last time and i was trying to put it there and because yeah so any anything that is related to the space and then could be could be the space that you're creating hydra but also could be just the space that you have physical space yeah sure space yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah right um yeah so how is it going uh maybe we can cut here okay like the the the recording bye", "U5AhmdKD5BQ": "yes ultima yeah hello hello it's already recording okay good welcome everyone welcome to our show it's becoming a podcast sort of i mean actually that was kind of the idea in the beginning i think but it's cool because i think if you see actually we have way where i was checking that sometimes there is more track uh traffic and though in these videos than in the best practices itself obviously is it a good thing or not i mean when i when i talk with this with my with my with my couple i think she was telling me that it makes sense i mean because we post these things and many times or you know we work a little bit glitches and yeah this kind of things so yeah and then we do it often so i guess yeah people will see okay what the you know those people are doing and then maybe you jump but maybe i guess i will try to be from the other side so i guess maybe i will check but not for one hour you know what is what is happening um because there is there is no yeah anyway but instead of that if you're curious somehow for what these people are doing then these people are talking now so then if you if you find interest in some of these things then you can just stay there and try to to to be with them and they may be yeah i think that make more sense but it's funny this one is funny and anyway it's this is it becomes i feel is more like a oh yeah by the way i have this is perfect for what i'm trying to say you see i have cries today okay uh it's becoming like a con confessionally this ah this is a confessionary when we when we comment what is happening i see it's cool how are you how are things going good um relax i was supposed to be away this week but it's not happening and uh that kind of uh i'm not i wouldn't say i'm happy that the performance is cancelled i mean it's not my performance i'm helping and um it's it's unfortunate but kind of gave us some time and space to to work uh on the performance itself so that's kind of good and um yeah i mean but the situation now here is you know uh i guess in belgium it's even worse but uh even in germany like like we saw today i don't think everyone was showing me yeah i'm gonna send you like these mems sometimes some of these mems are so funny sometimes are so stupid high names memes yeah it is uh yeah sorry yeah okay yeah but it's bad here yes so anyway europe is it's just going bad we're going back to that yeah but like like uh every every day like i see these things and then i just realized that it's just like at the right timing when no it happened yeah i know i when i because i think in germany was you guys just now are having a little bit more of cases but when i arrived in belgium belgium was getting bad really fast so then after one week i was here it was already they proposed things and they were going very bad very fast but yeah uh wait they just put the notes or the notes text values text strikes okay but just to continue on this topic like i think i'm i'm a bit like happy that uh we can you know work on um like work from home work on the things that we're doing in summer for example you know this i can maybe reboot the choreographic coding online sessions yeah it could be nice too i don't know how people are but like for example especially in north america they're you know having a hard time and um maybe it's uh it's good to do something like that i've actually again working with myanswoo uh from montreal and uh like well we were supposed to work on uh another project and um it's just good for me that i think when things canceled and i have to stay at home then i can be more um you know i can immerse myself in the project and not having uh every day like you know just meeting one hour to do something that doesn't work for us so it's good that like we have like a chunk of you know time you still because you still were working doing a lot of events yeah but that's you know some things are cancelled and anyways the projects are kind of uh not finishing but uh we have some kind of pause for some time and also the school is uh restarting but we started but uh i think they kind of encouraged to meet online instead of uh on campus which is still possible but uh i i think i wouldn't do it that's weird not like because so but anyway like the charge that you have in your school now is way is less than before then how it would normally be is it like that what do you mean by change like they charge like the academic charge that's what i mean with the the the the amount of time that you have to give for the school uh like commit commitment yeah yeah as well like the other the amount of uh planned hours and normally the school will give you per semester now should be i guess reduce yeah i i don't know anyways like the commitment at our school is not so high and that's kind of the reason why people like some people live in berlin like even though the school is in cologne and this is kind of good thing and bad thing at the same time because you know some people don't really like engage uh in the study too much and i'm kind of on the edge like i'm still reminding myself to be at the school which is kind of difficult in this time but uh yeah i think doing it remotely is kind of nice because you know i can just i have option to listen to it or like doesn't have to be actively participating in a discussion for example which i think is really interesting like but that's like really online thing that you can you know you can just turn off your video but you can still write in a chat and that's kind of nice thing not not the the girl who was listening to our talk for one two hours which happened yeah yeah but these these weird things can happen online so which i kind of like it yeah yeah yeah i mean but it's just i'm seeing that because i'm starting missing somehow because i'm being working more like just like my school is just pure development i mean it's like but but it was my option i didn't wanted to do like a masters in arts in in technology and arts i wanted just to learn the technological elements of multimedia and communication technologies but then of course because then i'm coming from that field from art then i mean just i'm at the end of this with my school but then i'm feeling really like oh my god this is so annoying you know like i mean now it's better because i have my final work so i can do my things but still i'm missing and trying to say that i miss being in art frameworks because then you can talk there's a space for reflection and there's a lot of i mean a lot of rising questions you know there is time to reflect and then you hear different  at any time uh but then in between all the all the the then is uh there's nice that you you make your own filters i guess in time you learn how to filter from all this information they're just people just putting out the the things yeah there's very interesting things that you will never think and some things like that i mean and they are reflective and not uh not always yeah i mean applying or trying to solve something specifically you know if i compare for instance like from what i'm learning it's just like very fast you know like the framework is super fast and and it's good because i then you train a little part as an artist i feel uh that has i have benefit a lot myself from being in that framework for a while okay your video your video is a bit lost but uh no you mean oh is it glitching anyways so you mean like to be an artist like being that kind of engineering or um development uh i would say like even just training yeah yeah when you're working like client base like that is basically all this framework i mean we can go we always we we have this conversation many times but so so i think a part of all this i by the way i have something interesting to say about that but uh what i'm trying to say is that uh when you're working client base uh then you have to provide fast solutions or propositions fast uh that so the client fast has to order the the the sub the yeah the client uh it needs to approve or disapprove that fast so you have to go through this opera this thing fast this uh create because this is still a creative process you have to go very fast how can you make cons how can you put concretely something that is abstract and create and and then just put it fast um so i think it's a good skill um i i feel that i i have learned a lot in the last four years that i have been doing this but at the same time i feel that i'm at the last part of that you know i feel that as well it's because it's a school no when i work professionally out of out of the school just in a really professional environment let's say i have the last year the opportunity to work like doing art direction in a in a digital marketing company so i will never do something like that but because of the school at some point one guy contacted me because he was very curious he said like what are you doing you know basically and then he buys me and then basically so it was the first office job that i got ever i so and i was oh i was honest with the guy so the guy said like okay just uh he invited me there and and anyway so that was working for an office and then was like longer than more than a month but it was it was nice i think it would not be nice if i have to stay there maybe for two years you know what i mean maybe it was nice experience to go every day to take the train go to the next i mean i felt very oh i'm so productive i got everything you know so i feel really nice to be a regular but then then i think it will kill me if i have to do it every day i don't know but anyway i think for what i was trying to say is that in in art frameworks uh you have more like in the school for instance there is an academia then you have places where people are thinking you know like or are questioning things so then you have the possibility to uh talk or or actually just participate of a forum as you said with a chat yeah yeah and it's not always about solving something but mostly making it more complicated and i was making it it's actually about more rising questions that make them more complicated yeah because the idea at the end is just to reflect about something so it's more about creating interesting frameworks yeah yeah true because we don't really agree on the ex existing frameworks anyways no no but that's that's what that's what i think i like that's in the play that i position where i try to position myself as an artist and trying to learn when i work between art and design is i think i try to be in between so it's still in a place that i can make concrete something uh that it responds to or aesthetics or functionality or this kind of things or but at this or at the same time being fluid enough to be enough in an artistic framework that i will define and sustain by my own concept and and yeah i thought and yeah and but i think it's not the yeah i think i've been trying to do that uh in a way it seems to me like maybe what i'm trying to say seems to me because it seems to me that as an artist i can be lazy in the sense that i mean the sense that it's just different the framework is different but yeah i could be lazy as the scent in the in the way that i can create um on the name of art and then i can if i have experience enough then i will sustain conceptually my art practice and and that will be okay so i will i will define the framework right um but when you're doing client work is not like that so it force you in another thing uh that is still it goes next to the market which is i mean there are many things to be there uh question about it and the system and stuff but a part of all these constraints uh i think as an exercise it's just good if you can if you can have the boat experience i think if you can have the experience of just working for the client but at the same time you have the experience you can keep the the practice of being an artist is such a is such a wonderful language because then you can you are fluctuating between the two yeah i don't know how you see this because i think you i mean you you have been doing this as well yeah exactly and um i don't know like in this chat i was not really expecting to talk about these things but well in a way yes because these days like i'm working on like different projects with other artists but i think what you're mentioning is more in the commercial um industry and i still remember like it's it's already like almost two years ago actually i was working in tokyo and that was like a real like commercial thing like with um um advertised advertising agency and um like cosmetics brand they were making an installation and i was just not hired but i was just freelancing as a programmer and i was just there for one month but like exactly i was in office from 10 to 5 or something i mean i was supposed to be there from nine to six or something but uh i was lazy so i was just like 25 but uh you know people they don't care about what uh how what time i'm there like if as long as i deliver something it's okay um which is good you know like it's kind of the i think it's kind of the privilege that like being an artist and not a developer although i like what what i do is you know i think it's just programming but um it kind of you know makes it a bit like something special anyways like how people see myself um what i wanted to say was yeah like i was there for one month and a friend actually like i was invited or recommended by a friend of mine who was already working in this project and he was working there for like more than a year i think and i was just there for a month but i was like i cannot really continue this like i was it was like a contract for a month and uh they were asking me to extend it uh like i don't know one week or two weeks but i just said no and i just booked a flight to berlin to move to germany i just decided it was really quick like i was i was not sure about my future but uh i just decided to leave japan and go to germany because that contract was really um it was it was good it was well paid and i was really confident of what i was doing but then at the same time just it sucks um my well i i don't like the word creativity but you know like i just put this like what i have in this project and like they just suck everything from me you know like i can do so many interesting things for myself with this capacity but if i'm just working there i you know what's what's left is like of course i learn things from the project like i think in the uh previous or i don't know like what which um uh chat it was but we talked about like um like clients or other collaborating artists would ask for something that i would never expect and realizing these things is quite fun but uh so that's something and like there's always like take away like that but simply like working for a project and like using my ability for commercial projects for me was like like especially like for advertising like that's no because um it's hard to say it i think it's you know like as long as like we have a good deal and like i don't overwork and um i'm well paid i mean it was the project was well paid but still um maybe because it was like full-time a commitment that's why like i felt like if you work for like five days you cannot really do anything on the weekend i think and that that's what i felt and that's why i left that industry in a way these days i yeah these days i work for other kind of projects like not so much with um companies anymore but i work with other artists which i still like question like what is it like it's it's always like you know i learned something and it's always like different projects it's never like just copying pasting what i've done and changed colors or something but always this challenge and for example in this project that we are controlling robots and like it's it's so complex and uh so many challenges but like at the same time i start to feel like is it is that really something i want to do you know like i mean if it's just for money then that's okay but at the same time like what do you mean what do you mean in terms of is like it's it's about time it's about like how yeah time like am i investing my time right or is about time um i would yeah i think so like [Music] yeah it's it's hard to say [Music] time that's something yeah but i think that's interesting and maybe you can like take it from there as well like to bring it back to the practice i think this like this idea of the time something that like if we just like put it from that example is something you cannot escape from it no like you cannot escape from it um um but that's that's so uh i mean okay without trying to go really into like what is time but it's basic but that uh it's just a measurement that we have no the the measurement that we have and yeah and the way of or places work it's like yeah you time time is money all this thing um so there's so many things that i think i want to do um but i think as well i'm getting better that with a year is like actually um it's yeah i i understand slowly better that there are many things that i should not i should not do how to say it like maybe i end i i slowly i think i start seeing what our priorities instead of just jump yeah instead of just jumping because i would like to learn everything you know and you cannot do it um so and yeah and that's it's just it just responds to the time i cannot because i don't have the time so then i have to decide i have to put priorities uh because i have a limited time right now yeah yeah i think that's interesting like also i i said about this project in dusseldorf but it's it's one thing is actually not just about the nature of the project itself but i have to commute and that takes like from door to door like it's like roughly like one hour and that's quite a lot and also given that the train is only like once or twice an hour i have to you know uh adapt my schedule according to that and this is th this is really the the tricky part of the time it's not like it's am i working for like six hours or eight hours um i don't know if you're still there the video is lost but uh just continue i think i'll just wait a little bit checking your message this is a weird thing about internet i would say that oh yeah you're gone um so yeah what i was saying is the time constrained and also actually this is like a kind of meta uh way of addressing this topic because now i don't know if i should stop the recording or and and just wait for jorge to come back or it is something that i should just improvise and say something and i think this is something not related to the work itself but through the the practice we do i think it's just started i start to feel more comfortable improvising and not killing the time but like gluing the time because that's what we need to do because i i to be honest like i always said like when i'm on the stage i always have technology around there and there's a fear that something will break and then i always say that i can just dance by myself because i'm physically there and i can do something even if the projector is not working or my computer crashed or anything as long as there is light or even there's no light i can just still move and show something to people and but this is more like an idea i was saying i think i was confident enough that i could do it but i never did it and because fortunately things were working all the time but when i'm with jorge it's like this happens all the time i'm not blaming uh blaming him or myself or anything but it's just the nature of how internet works and because also because we said that we have one hour for well not like this chat thing is like discussion is not so strict but our practice we keep it for one hour so let's say like we start at 9 00 pm and we finish at um 10 p.m so if he's uh okay anyways i'll just continue with him okay um welcome back welcome back hello so you're talking about space i think yeah well i i was talking about quite a lot of things while you're going actually okay can you make us can you zoom all right no you have to watch it later but but it's really like a good time to reflect on time because this is basically the time on the internet that always things don't work you know and we don't share the same time in a way so that's that's really interesting reflection especially about our practice yeah i was thinking like yeah because i was trying to bring the conversation back there so then is how how you see time how you experience time in the in the practice yeah so um i have to i have to be really honest about the last practice that i remember that it was amazing and we were so excited after the practice but to be honest now i i totally forgot what we did and i didn't really i did rewatch i i i did re-watch once but still like i like i was from the top to the end like i i made windows like side by side and i lost it but i forgot what it was but i just remember that it was really quick it was not like one hour it was very quick that's the only thing like that i remember and i i messed up the sound so you were always hearing the beat no no that was nothing in the previous one oh that's nothing okay then maybe i'm just mixing up then in the previous one i know yeah there was a beat yeah yeah that was a bit yeah the the the way who i think is like i see that that becomes maybe because i'm thinking in dimensionality often now so and then is so we have um uh we share some we shared a time there in the practice right that's why we said we we even said like okay don't don't forget to i or again i go on again then i have to improvise again that means which i can actually continue on what i was saying um let me just write to him um so how i ended cut was that in the practice um yeah so basically on the stage i say that i can improvise myself but on the internet it's that's oh yeah you're coming back okay yeah great so yeah i was saying that so we start from putting this club no so we said like we agree that's something that we agree we want to have um an agreement to know i mean it is if it's at some point if at some moment is relevant to know what place in time where were we and actually that somehow we propose it i guess is because we are trying to to map in a way we are trying to i think to map the intention the intentions in time uh because we are we are not com we are not doing linear composition like we are just glitching things between feedbacks so it's not really relevant to know uh the the the composition at that moment maybe because it's just glitching actually um but in terms of intentionality i think it is uh or trying to understand what it what was happening you know what was happening at uh at that moment specifically what was happening in that side and what was happening in this side so in in a way who i see it in the practice i don't know what you think about it is that we um so we collapse we we collapse a chunk of time so we choose one hour of time now we are very precise that nine is close so we close the chunk of time and at 10. um but in between uh then the time is moving constantly fast i this the way i experience for instance if i'm stuck at something and i have to ask you that's short but it is no it's super long the time no because then i'm stuck so i'm trying to get more information but if i'm into something if i'm in the flow of something then the time the time goes yeah um i don't know how you experience that yeah i think i mean when you ask me something i don't know if it's long or short in a way it's kind of short because you know we're kind of trying to solve it quick but we just see the time running which is like a different kind of um time time goes fast because yeah um that's that's i would say um yeah always this practice is so weird like i i i think that it's more like obvious like for like a first 15 minutes or until like 30 minutes like i feel it's a bit slow and i don't know like what's like how fast i should do it like the spacing is really hard and then after that it's just like you know goes and then around like so always like we have this kind of um you know um i don't know what's what what's the name but uh we we just uh tried to do the like last 10 minutes like just that's just like running is so true like but i think i think all these things i i think that's what i make the practice interesting because we have doing we start we should start i put it here like now auto numbers uh practices how many practices do we have so far we need to make a party as well when we go to the 100 for instance we should have already now more than 20 i'm sure uh it could be but yeah like one year in one year like we can have like 50 so yeah 100 would be yeah uh we have to do it for like two years okay so let's say okay let's say we have to really celebrate when we do 50. when we do 50. yeah and we have to do like uh we have to think in doing something special uh like yeah it's something something related with the practice uh a practice we have to do a practice uh but what i'm trying to say is like maybe that's why because we come together often is like that's part of the uh underlining lines of the contract or you know like in a ways like because we know in a way we are practicing this often it's true i feel always like half an hour as well i'm more like is more pacing and then testing and and then from there you start ramping up and the entire thing is happening and just at the last part the last five minutes 10 minutes two minutes um then just we both go like bananas but i i would say like one thing about this is that uh it really works well because sometimes things don't work you know like we have like technically something strong or when we're at node you know like things are just not working but at the you know this 10 minutes like we just decide to do whatever we can do you know and that's the most interesting part yeah because that's so it's basically in a way it feels like no matter how at the last part we do whatever we can do exactly and some kind of an agreement without means is unspoken agreement yeah exactly i think that's cool because i see it very close to dance and to composition in dance like these are the kind of agreements that you will do when you're dancing with somebody and then you know the person you know or even just not in dance but in football and i know like when you have to get to know a partner then you then you know then just basically you don't even have to think just you both are thinking in a similar way yeah where to go how to navigate but i think so that i think that's cool but then uh i think this is the first time that we are talking about time to be honest uh i don't think we i don't think that we have really speak about time we talk about space intentionality i think this is about uh time and i think it's a it's very interesting because um we perceive the time because we are here you know but um that's proof if you are in other so we experience our bodies experience time by the cold time or week we age in certain way because we are constrained in these dimensions that we have these three uh this third dimensionality right so every human they we re the our bodies respond to the nature basically the planning that we are right but if you would if if this body will be in others in another dimension so there will be other physic forces and other thing the body will not age in the same speed you see what i mean like this is uh so we are aging here because because of the planet basically because we live in this planet and then everybody will age in the same way but if you will be in another in another planet at another place where the physics of the place uh are different then you will age differently like let's say a gravity is different or uh oxygen all the all the constraints that makes the dimension then dimension the dimensions of the world uh are different then your body will age different right that i mean that's proof when people go to the uh astronauts for instance um when they come they i don't know is they is that they age less i don't know i don't know but it's just like i think it's like just a tiny tiny fraction um of that uh with and then you can prove that the body in other conditions or are just age different and in other words you hold faster in the earth in relation with other uh in another in the space let's say and and i bring it here because of that so that means basically a dimension no like let's say this planet is our dimension like the way how we experience the our bodies right now is in this three-dimensional space the way how we perceive uh the world as humans but in the practice then we perceive the world in a two-dimensional space so it is through the through the the screen is two-dimensional right and yeah i don't know what i was trying to say so there's different time basically that's the way you want to make that conclusion i don't know like to be honest like i don't know i i don't think um i did i agree with most of the parts well so that means i disagree with most of the parts i mean what you say is probably right but i think what makes more difference is probably like more individual like perception and stuff and what's i think what's more interesting is one thing but you cannot escape the the laws for the like physique laws like one thing is your perception but no i think i have to disagree with you in terms of like uh with dimensionality in the sense like we pers so that's perception we perceive base and that's coming from our senses right so the good example is like the perception of the dimensionality of the an insect life is different than us because this this the scent uh their senses the senses of a fly are different than our our senses so i agree i think i think physically we let's say or the things that makes us like we just experience as humans in the same way i mean what i'm saying is sure i don't know maybe yeah so well i don't know like because i think individual difference is quite huge and um and also like but i i don't i didn't think about going to this direction but i was more interested in like thinking about dimensionality in a way that this is recorded and we can watch it later and that really makes the difference because if it's just one time thing is and that that's not recorded then we just experience as a like in that place in that you know time but then we can re-watch it that creates another reality but if you if you watch it again but maybe that's interesting then then when we watch this again then could you experience yourself again i don't think so because it's already changed but you can try but then you don't you think that still you could like it would it will i mean if you're seeing yourself speaking yourself i think part of that i've been partly you are re uh re uh viving something re igniting something that is in you as a memory sure and then partially that's that point of view i think partially then you partially you will re leave that thing again of course you will not because that is in the past but because it's captured in in that medium yes but this is like kind of we're trying to think that we try to re-create re-experience that but what could be more interesting is that we can have another reality through your you know each other's screen for example and that just it's not just like we are replaying it but it's you know creates something new which is more interesting i think yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i agree have a great video well i think this has been like like we this we we end up talking about this like because you know why i put it here with question mark because it's the first time we started speaking about time because time is something that it's time actually when i was searching about it some some time ago some years ago and it's like it's that's a very it's something that people don't really it's not it's just it's time in a way just like it's a coordinate system that humans give to just experience and just to use it but yeah it's something that is very no you cannot really prove like uh time i mean yeah that you can go really deep into that sense like time is something it's a constant that we have but at the same time it's so difficult to talk about it so we cannot escape from it but we can as well we cannot talk about it it's very even then if we put it about in the in the in the in the practice i think it's like we create a universe for one hour and in that one hour i think if we are not thinking in the time consciously then just we are uh kind of like floating and enjoying what is happening and just like being fluid in the time because the time it feels differently as you said like at the beginning it's slow and then after it's fast so basically we float between a frame that we understand um but maybe it's because as well we don't we don't really have conscious consciousness about the time about that you have you this is this is what i wanted to ask you actually but uh i i'm always aware of the clock yeah because yeah i need to time things you know the the pace and especially at the very end like i always look at the clock okay it's 58 it's 58 it's 58 now it's 59 59 59 okay now i'm just closing this 59 59 59 okay 10. i close it like it's it's really like but it's not really stressful like i just it's just part of it and i'm kind of used to you know i'm autistic and i'm just like sometimes i'm just looking at the clock all the time because i just need to see it and there's no reason and it's not like i'm waiting for something but like every two minute i look at my phone check the time and okay now again it's after two minutes again after three minutes like this is like kind of something i do so it's okay i don't know why i'm saying this but no but i think it's it's cool because you're we're talking about time um so i don't know how how it is like how how you're like how much like conscious you are in the practice i think in the practice i think i always i feel at the beginning that i have all the time in the world you know and always i feel like that and then slowly then i start feeling that i'm uh the time is passing and that i there are things that i have that i want to do so then it's my desire of things that i want to do uh and then basically then seeing that the clock is coming i think it's yeah my experience i think every single time has been the same in in this structure the beginning i think i have time so then if i have time they are relaxed so then i will just try to float and be very um conscious of my body your presence the elements that i have and do a nice artistic research at some point and start seeing the clock and then i start putting some kind of like it's kind of like click and then i see like okay i have to start like moving on and it just be more concrete and and then from then at some point it's like it's getting again then i start getting more okay i need to start doing something and then i start getting work uh i stress but i mean now before it was really stressed because of the technical things now i'm not stressed from that um uh but but still is like okay i need there are so many things and then i got like and then at some point uh it will be around five ten minutes two minutes depends how my experience once was through the practice but then at the end at that last part i said like it you know all these things that i have been building up i just said it i'm just gonna do something like then i just and then i end up doing something that it just it comes really from my heart and uh and i think every single time it goes in the same way [Music] i think so there are different elements but basically the chunks go like that i think see and it's and it's just like like at the end you go like crazy and that's but it can only happen because we build up something like it doesn't it's maybe there's no connection but no no there has to be connection because if i would be doing it alone i can like when i did my solo alone for instance i go in that crazy i there is more um there's more uh dynamism in the things that i do in the sense like i don't know i have a peak after five if i do my solo for one hour then i have a dynamics like very high peak after 10 minutes and then i go slow and i mean there are many different uh peaks that i that i feel when i do a loan but if i'm with you because i know as well that you are living at ten o'clock then i know that uh before what we're doing that is the practice that is together i need you to be there even if i'm even if i'm doing crazy things alone then i once you're gone the practice is gone as well yeah so then even though i'm not directly like trying to do something with you then i need yet you are there that even what i'm really fast in my doing you are there if you're gone i cannot keep on going yeah yeah i'm gonna try it you know i don't know how it's for you i was just sorry i was thinking about something else i was just wanted to ask you like so it's already 15 minutes we were talking which is i think it goes by like really fast like it just feels like talking for like 20 minutes or something this time we were so unstructured i mean like the the the the before we went into node and somehow i feel i see my notes because i keep my notes and then i see like slowly i start like building something and then like now when we have these stocks like i still do my notes but then i they are very unstructured uh but i think it's it's just is the way how they go and they're okay because my intention was talking talking today a bit about space in terms of actually more concrete about curatorial processes and especially i see hey well now is yeah now we have to close soon because at some point we started speaking about time and that was about i saw the clock it was around uh half uh 10 30. so then we were in the time for a while right i mean i know i just i just thought like maybe we can also think about the topic or theme every time which probably doesn't really um you know work i mean it doesn't work but it's not like the purpose of this chat um yeah but i think this note thing is quite important like sorry that i don't take notes um i started taking those um but i think it's nice if we can have some kind of archive like not just videos but something that kind of yeah yeah yeah i can actually share it in the notes that i have in in a document and then you share it yeah but i i have to be honest that uh i don't really i don't really like your notes no no like no like totally it totally works for you but it's just like okay i see it but it says okay i i don't know but what do you like about the node like the structure of the nodes i think it's just that i need to put some energy to understand it yeah of course i don't understand what i read yeah and that's just then i feel like okay just it yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah of course yeah because no no but but i totally yeah but but but i like that you're doing this you know uh yeah but anyway when i do these notes as well in different subjects as in different topics i it takes me time every if i want to use my notes it takes me time for it it's for me like what the am i saying because as well i have tipos uh have different things structure like uh yeah so but anyway i will share this in the document uh and then i will put it there every week and then you can put maybe with color or something as well if if you want to if you want to join yeah that i mean i actually make some effort to tag in the the youtube video which yeah i mean i don't know how to say it annotation or at least you know yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so i would say that's kind of the way for me to take okay yeah because for me then yeah that's different that would that would be a different exercise for me nobody do it like that because i think it's cool like that and and then maybe ah because i thought yeah if i want to do that then i have to then i will have to upload my videos which is okay i will do it at some point maybe but at the same time all the videos are just organized there so i prefer to keep them in one place yeah or we have to go back to the the peacemaker no but i will just i mean we are really realistic like with the we are just busy like that's just like i i don't really have too much time so it just has to be practical i think now like this works like uh i think i will just share this and about the the the topics for the for for the meetings i think uh is that the way how i'm singing is that i there are some things like for instance that we talked today about time um [Music] and yeah it's what i the way i see how i do it is i once you upload the video then normally i kind of like i summarize that in between two words or one word like i put it always when i attack you i said like chat uh time and something else i guess something will come up over here yeah which is not the big note but it just gives some it's a it was like a title some title exactly yeah yes no i i think how we're doing right now is like totally good like fine like it's i'm not saying that we should add something or yeah like we don't even have to bring anything to this chat because it's just happening like this so you know and i think maybe is if you if we for instance is like because i felt before we went to note i really felt that i was building up something so like now i'm a bit lost from that uh but at the same time i'm okay with it so and it will because we keep on doing this so um yeah that's cool yeah maybe maybe uh you should stop maybe the recording for now okay [Music] bye", "vMHCXgGnjm0": "[Music] yes what did happen uh yeah i don't know just tell me what happened i don't know it's just i'm still like like i i feel like it was really like one hour like i don't know like i just feel it was like you know just happened so quick yeah yeah yeah and actually normally because like if something is not working with my thing i will get very pissed you know i get really good and uh but then this time i was like okay i mean and already i planned some things i wanted to use some things because i'm mixing with other works so about uh yes some things with the yeah sneezing you know particles because we are working with this with the seat well like the patterns of sneezing so it's just the whole thing is it's in my head because of what is happening so i thought okay i will do something i will find something while we're doing that so i put it in my notes and that happened to relax and i was okay but it was i really will enjoy like i don't know like at the beginning it was very subtle you know like it was very i was just coding sound actually i don't know if you've heard it sometime like one point i tried to send it to you but i don't know if it was working you were saying to me like but how uh on live lab like i just tried to oh no you sent me yeah you sent me sound yeah okay cool yeah yeah like i don't know how what so what did you did you were you so one of your windows was sending me that sound or what yeah i was i was just trying that yeah with like yeah yeah yeah and the other window was just you like so this time like i don't know why my sound was not working on my main computer so i just connected the other computer i mean which is this surface to send uh my voice to you because it was not working at like i don't know why linux audio is always strange so i don't know but uh yeah um but it was cool yeah like i think i feel like i don't know like i think what was because for me was it was the hydra was like i think it was more chrome that it was giving me trolls because i erased all the to the basic settings two days ago so it should be around because i never had the problems they had to have today that it was one thing not working then i tried to test it was the number of the cameras and it was doing weird stuff and right now let's test that code that normally from there i will start and was running so it could be as well the network i don't know like i don't think so but something wrong happened but it's good that uh i already did i already tried chroma key on your video so that's why i knew the trick that the the color was wrong somehow on my video so you mean the one that i was using yeah like because your video on live lab i was already capturing and uh and doing chroma at first i was like why doesn't it work and then i soon i noticed that the color is not green enough so i added this hue to shift the hue a bit and that was that was the huge that was a huge thing yes because i think it was a bit bluish so no to not go to blue but more to the red spectrum ah yeah that's why my camera was reddish okay okay i understand that okay yeah exactly how cold my camera is yeah yeah yeah but that also added nice nice effect i think yeah yeah yeah it is it's a warm it's warm yeah yeah it's a warm color i mean i always play with the hue function okay so i was thinking that actually uh because uh so next week for i have one one week off as well uh from my school so maybe if you have some time maybe i would like to do one session or like just some technical thing with hydra sure uh like to just to to catch up a bit with because i haven't used it that much uh and then i will i would i think i have time to spend a little bit of the yeah and hydro next week so we can propose one meet to have like some technical let's say best practices within best practices i know that's what the people calling videos like tips tips and tricks you know tips and tricks and and hydra yeah uh yeah so something like that cool you're doing you're you're using a lot of strong colors now you know like really i don't know what exactly are you using but you are using like it looks like a very pop like yeah it looks very itchy but pop like i don't know like you're the exposer i don't know what exactly are you using but it seems like the brightness of the exposure is like it's completely exploded oh and and i think at the end i was just like shaking my head like headbanging a lot because that was so funny because i i i think i coded this um hydra to react to the sound and only only captures my body when there's like high pitch sound and high pitch sound comes like every once in a while so that triggers my body to be like burned in the in hydra and then i think it was still tracking uh like like bright color so my face was still there but it was uh i was moving a lot so it was kind of making some glitches so it looks like my body with like my head is the complete glitch and bouncing did you notice because like as well so what i did today for instance like was i and was exactly the same thing i did in in node is that the window that i use in my chroma is the the main window of my bdmx so what i do is like uh like so the my chroma my background in hydra uh is my b is the main output from ibdmx so what i do is like i export like the the switcher in my bdmx and then i have another another windows but then let's say i i export you so like normally the windows the window where you are working uh the one who has the glitches so then i i grab that in in in ddmx and then from there i can do other things and then put as well other my cameras and then other things and then the main output of that is what i'm using in my background as a background yeah yeah i see yeah so then but then what i what i was doing today i don't know if you've been noticed is like i use the i use out your reactiveness in your in the feed that i was getting from you so like uh so you were bound because the the sound that we get constantly was that was not meant i mean when i put it at the beginning was not meant for that but because it was like boom boom boom boom so it's it's shaking constantly the image so you were you were like constantly bouncing like yeah uh i don't know if you noticed that that's a way because you you have you had the scroll thing like which recital i have i have this scroll but on me i have the score on me but mean hydra uh so that's just me but the the image in the background was not moving i mean it was what still but was shaking so it was audio reactive to low sounds okay so basically to base so every time there was a boom there was then then the whole composition was shaking yeah but because it was very faded then yeah you have to we have we will see it after it like that you will see this i'm very curious to see the each other's uh view yeah yeah yeah yeah but were you listening to other music no i was i was just playing my percussion and i was like even like trying to uh make your volume low because uh it got like you know at first i was like no no i'm not gonna listen to this so i you know what i did today like before because before i did it i don't remember if i did it but today for instance like so i start like this and basically is somehow i feel that i was proposing this thing no like some kind of like intro like that and then at some point so you start with that and then i was laughing so because this is the conversation you know and then i was because then i was not moving no and then i was okay and then i just mute you and then i will mute everything actually not only you but no okay uh and then i was doing that from time to time like muting everything and and then node and yeah so this i think is the first time i'm trying like oh so so you're getting the sound for the whole time all the time of course okay okay now i get it because i think i think i i it was not my intention i didn't mean to send this out but for me it was funny because but that's what i think it was cool i mean it felt today that it was very playful i don't know like the mistakes or whatever it was happened but was very playful because like so i proposed this silence so you catch the silence you you were there with me and after a few i don't know like 10 seconds then it's like boom boom boom boom boom boom so for me i was laughing we have to say okay so this is the response that you already got now i understand now i understand because i think the reason why my voice was not there is because i i mixed up the the audio device so it was sending the sound from my title cycle instead of my voice but i think that was cool because i think i think what is important for me is that i need to respect my spaces sometimes so and that's i think i shared with you when we were in germany like when that i'm very i think i used to be very i think very extreme ways so let's say if i'm in a relation where it's like more like i'm caring so let's say i'm care indeed what we do here then sometimes i will forget what is what i want what is what is that i want you know and so for instance today because your life your sound was too loud i mean it was too invasive i just need to move everything because i don't know technically was not working but what i was doing so i have to think what i'm gonna do you know so then i just mute everything and then i give time for myself like to okay then just slow down uh today i was not uh you", "XPWZ1QY1JDM": "my back is killing me today man like i okay because i was carrying uh the retina and the the 16 inches to get today and because i'm working because i was wearing a notch and in the in the retina and so i have to carry it to laptop so i'm the kinect too so i was carrying a lot of today and so i guess my bag yeah was really hurting but otherwise uh good is nice to talk to you it seems to me now that we are talking to an audience like thank you for having me here yes how are you so give an introduction and then we have a time for the speakers you know i i actually had a similar uh i mean similar day like i i also have my uh computer and you know this uh new computer oh so yeah that's different it's different carrying that one than the surface right yeah i mean surface is you know light but the other computer is you know uh it's not heavy but you know [Music] if you're used to i mean i remember literally that you were what you were carrying one of your surface in a in a sheet of paper it's that big in a in an all four a4 so if you compare carrying an a4 with the this is normal then i guess you you're not used to you have to get used to no but you don't you don't know my new computer that is uh not it's like you show me like you showed me like it's like the sawtak yeah you totally like the small version of that sawtech that they have there in node no yeah yeah i mean that itself is not that heavy but uh it comes with a gigantic um power yeah just one for mine but um yeah it's it's not really fun to carry it around yeah well i think if you get attacked by somebody then you can you have a powerful weapon if you get attacked by somebody you can kill with somebody to do that true and they even electrocute someone anyways um yeah but uh yeah things are where are you are you in at home or where are you yeah i'm back in cologne how did you move already yeah i'm just uh moved and this is like the i didn't mean to you know put the green screen but i noticed before this like if i there's like a big window and if i just keep it uh like without any i there's no curtain so weird uh and if i just put it like uh just a window then it has a reflection and you can see all the rooms so it's kind of a you know awkward so i just put the green screen oh i just now just now i put my camera yes that's what i think you said again no that's that's why i didn't see you at the beginning but so but then your apartment is like so then you see people in front you have neighbors in front or something yeah it's a bit weird like uh you know this uh how they say like courtyard like in the in the uh you know if you thought which floor do you live it's a ground floor so it's that's why it's not on the main building but uh you pass the courtyard and there's like a it looks like a garage and it smells like a garage actually [Music] congratulations for your new cat decision [Laughter] yeah but i i just treat it as a kind of you know half studio so uh i mean it's not like a studio but you know it's it's nice to uh we have some um just feeling of the workspace in the garage we should we should con convert that space in a studio yeah or even a gallery or something like a gallery yeah it looks like a gallery yeah that actually from here it looks like a white cube exactly you could just see this way yeah yeah or like if this like window is you know well i mean it's not facing the street but uh if it was like facing the street we can just make a pop-up gallery you know yeah definitely super nice so otherwise how how was it the the last session how because yeah because then maybe we can do a catch up so the last session it was very weird because what happened is like right five minutes i was oh you're gone i'm gonna just do this when we start once we start and then i started moving things like five minutes before and then the this thing is a heavy thing it fell directly in the laptop and so then the key word was is this damage like they are working down um but it just at that moment i was just you know it's just when it failed i just you know like everything at the same time and but then so and then afterwards i thought like okay i mean already right away i will start just trying to okay call the apple care system and try to find what was the best solution how bad what is it do i have to pay all these kind of things but then fast i thought okay maybe i should try to do the practice from what am i you know because yeah uh yeah at some point i think i i i could slow myself i and i thought like okay if i that's that's a moment actually where i will try to do the practice and and then i so i didn't wanted to tell you anything as well because i thought i will tell you afterwards but i just want to see i want to be i want to basically i was sharing it was not different in the sense that but i think what we do is like we share an intimate space in a way it seems like we're kind of like a couple in that space like we we define a private space that we we nourish every week and so from that point of view as well i uh so i thought at that moment so i'm just basically sharing without telling you some well but basically it's not different as i see it in the sense that we while we do the practice we within the doing we share frustrations because sometimes things are working or i ask you something or something goes you know something happens so we basically are dealing with the space that we are having for one hour so from that point of view i think there was no different more than yeah it was not more different than the i thought i gonna be there so then we share the space you know um i don't know how you experienced but the way how i experienced your interaction for me was very it i felt it very kind in the sense that i felt very very it was very nice for me because then i feel you were doing the thing but it's like you were kind of checking up like from time to time you know you're kind of like attempting sometimes like what is happening you know but with with caring i don't know but maybe that was my interpretation you know you were trying to read what is happening you know like so somehow it seems like without me telling you there's something happening you kind of catch the no words and you you're still following the rules that we have like the so we do with our setups but at the same time you were being very uh [Music] human uh and very extending uh without being too much because it's still within the practice you were checking you know like you see uh i don't know how how was the experience for you like the whole experience um to me to be honest uh i i've been like having like big days i mean uh so i i think i wanted to also like talk about this but uh the following day i did have this uh performance uh online and um then did one the one that you sent me the yeah yeah yeah yeah um and then i was like also like you know back and forth so but so i have to i want to watch it again the last practice but i just remember that um how to say um i was kind of confused because you know we were kind of really waiting for it and you're really like yeah frustrated or pissed off or something that you know it was not happy and i was like okay i don't know and also like i feel that it's i don't know if i was like trying to catch up with you but i i remember that i was like really kind of i do my own stuff and then like i feel like i left you behind i mean it doesn't mean you know it's it's good or bad but just like feels like you know it's just like so different so much different like in terms of like rhythm and you know how fast we progress and like i was like just trying to do my own stuff and then like so where's where's yeah but i think that that's what i mean because then then then for me it's more that so it it it makes sense what my my readings because it's like so you do which uh but then you go you know like you you you kind of like you go and test you know is it and then which is very is very similar how humans relate you know like we this is a technological setup you know like that's the intention that we have and but then uh that's very human within the practice you know like the whole ex i mean the way ho i think we manage uh i think i think yeah i see it i see it very human and then and then i could say it even more like to let it translate in between uh expectations and intentions or actually so expectations [Music] and um it's weird because it's basically yeah i think it's very similar to like the one when you're trying to talk with somebody like person this that i'm trying to say this is what i'm trying to do that i'm trying to explain something that i cannot articulate so uh so then you are listening but it's like you have to be off and also off and on constantly because i'm not i'm not finishing basically what i'm trying to say but maybe this is like you know it's a bit that's interesting because it sounds like uh how it works in the practice because you know like we're not always like like attending to each other we just like you know just say whatever and uh or i just think like while you're talking i just think about something else and then i just say it because i know that it's recorded so it's you know easier to not like kind of off uh synchronized um and the practices like that too and more i mean it's probably more significant in the practice because we don't have to you know do it together in a way but yeah yeah but that's that's what i found that that i thought it was so so special is because that's what i meant like we both we both signed this contract some time ago like months before and it's a contract that every week we we we confirm like we and we actually we get better in conceptualizing and the whole thing where is it going and so we are understanding what we're doing so it's very business wise you know it's like very like we we go we meant business in a way like we are working at that moment but because something happens that actually i don't even told you but then you can feel it then then that business get compromised uh in a in a i don't know if positive it's just it just i think for me what if but what i'm trying to say is like what we experienced but something that is the first session that we have and it's not because the technology was not working it's just because there was something uh off you know it's something there is not you know um and and in that sense i think it's completely is different you know in that sense like there is certainly uh a channel of attention you know there is a very you know i felt it how i felt it is like kind you know but that's my appreciation that i feel there is some kindness you know there is some kind of like a person who is there or trying to be there sometimes but do you think it's also like related to the fact that it was the first one after we met i don't think so i i don't think so what i thought actually is i feel very disappointed i mean my head at that moment was like you know i was trying just to chill and then i thought at some point even i remember when i opened bdmx and at some point i said i didn't want to use green key i was like flipping and then at some point i thought that aya because i was pissed off because i thought before i knew what i'm gonna do you know more or less i knew basically i have the my safe a safe template something that the last thing that i use so i thought i'm just gonna play with this like then but uh then it's like proof you can yeah you can that's not working like that you know even even if i was working with bdmx that i can use like videos literally that i can trigger i cannot count you cannot count with that uh note if not if what we're trying to do is sharing uh the space this intimate space of being knowing each other and having like some this relation and the working space i think i think composing or like pre-thinking the things might work you know like having and let's say i have my sad setup and and i think okay i know the last week work i'm gonna keep it like this uh tomorrow those things cannot work if if when the proposal is in one hand to be vulnerable as in all these technical things that we have been speaking the last weeks the last months all this contract of what is the practice in terms of technology basically uh or the elements and all these kind of things that we are trying to all these uh arguments parameters that we are defining in the in the doing um but on the other hand it seems clear as well that maybe it could be i see it maybe it's because we met could be that that then there is there is another element as well of the like there is there's another element like of trying to communicate you know like uh trying to catch up without speaking because now we are speaking for instance like but i don't know how you felt about reason like because i have some certain closeness with you then i thought oh it's it's yeah i think it's then i think in my head it changes in the sense that we do what we would used to do i guess but then is uh in a way then i then have more we met each other we met so yeah i mean i'm really curious to see what's happened next week move next next time that we're doing that actually yeah because that wasn't the first time that we were trying after the note right exactly and also like i i got my new computer and you had some issues and you know like everything was like really off in a way yeah yeah i i don't know what why i wanted to interrupt but um yeah yeah so like i really don't know like how to so but how how was your like maybe let me ask you how was your doing because i thought you were doing things and how was how was this how was the process how was like how we interrupted was it you know like how did you felt in terms of time like did you feel this on off or what would you what were you feeling in terms of like what am i doing am i doing something or what yes i i don't know it felt really like um not emptiness but like i feel like there's no like response from you like kind of kind of you know like i'm just like doing doing doing and then i don't get any response and that's why i have to stop and you know see what you're doing and try to get what you're doing because i really feel that like it's not that i'm ignored but i just don't get a reply and that's just feels weird did you feel how how big was the level of frustration in that sense it was not that much of a frustration i think i feel it's like also like because that was on thursday and on friday i had a performance the other one and i kind of i don't want to say this but like on thursday our practice was more like a really like a practice that i really wanted to you know just to you know come back to what i'm doing and it's not like a rehearsal but like just to see what i can do yeah so in that sense like i was really like kind of like focused on myself like what i can do with hydra with movements and sound and uh in a way like at first like i so i think i assume that like i don't have to like do something with you in a way i mean not that i'm ignoring you but i don't have to like care too much and then i go go and go go on and then like you're not there and so like also like you you came late so i think i already had time to develop i think that's also didn't really help because you know um of course i don't prepare before i don't know what time we started at 9pm let's say like i don't i just you know maybe open 10 minutes after yeah 10 or 15 i think and uh like so i don't like at 9pm i have tools open like i don't start coding that time i mean i start from 9pm so but yeah like because i have 10 minutes let's say i just like started develop things because that's like i thought that's the um practice but i was actually i was already confused because when you're late you would say that you know let's start at 9 30 or um yeah you you tell me you know something i'll let you know something yeah yeah so i was like not completely sure if i should start or not yeah yeah yeah yeah there was a very bizarre uh but i'm glad actually to be honest i'm glad like in one hand like i fix my laptop i mean i need i fix the problem now i i just want it will take one hour and i don't have to pay the whole thing that that's practical thing is so so and uh but a part of that i'm glad that it happened because i checked what was partly to be honest like the just some snaps um and for for me as well because it was like i'm somebody who who i'm i'm very reactive like i'm in this i will be very reactive you know like if something like that happens i will try to solve it immediately you know uh yeah will be very reactive this part of the how my system is and then i i noticed that uh i'm with the years i'm trying to work in my own my own health you know so then i know it will not make a difference for instance if i it's 11 p.m i cannot make a call you know this can i know in some some way after i calm down i know that is not gonna change but at that moment i'm just reactive so then when i was seeing when i was checking for parts the video then i thought it was uh it was it was uh yeah i was flipping all over the place and then sometimes i was there at some point even i was really like even so moving or doing something with from what i was feeling but then uh i was more i was glad yeah when i checked the video after uh and i was seeing actually your reactions for because at that i was very surprised because i could see that you were going back and forward and in what you were doing and that was for that was very that was new you know like the way how we have that interaction in that moment and i found very interesting because it is within a contract um and it's not big yeah it's it's something that uh yeah it was something new there's something definitely new in in that in the thing um [Music] yeah it was something new so so i'm glad that we could be in the space of course yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and then uh yeah then the day after i had a performance well i don't know what yeah performance to practice afterwards um so i had an issue that sound didn't work um i don't know why uh not at all i mean i could speak to the computer but i i couldn't make this like sound uh you know though yeah so it was weird like i think and that day i had a head like bad headache already like before starting and uh like maybe 15 minutes before starting i you know started set up things and then i noticed that bluetooth is not working on my new computer so i have to what was not working bluetooth for the sound for that for this and like it was not like it was totally off and i cannot turn it on so um what time it happened like 15 minutes before that before it starts yeah so something like the drive or something is some installation thing well it was working before so that's why i was confused and then i restarted the computer it was still not working and i turned it off the computer and then turned it on and then it was back but i couldn't make the the title cycles you know the sound uh system working and i tried until like you know one minute before but i was like okay i just start with without the sound because you know whatever it's it's part of this practice and also like i was not really um i didn't really decide how to do the performance because actually like i thought it's gonna be like a you know the practice that like like well we do it but also like i sometimes do it alone and maybe i just do it like that but then if i when i told about this uh performance to someone like uh you know well not like friends and also like uh someone rather than you know important like someone from the theater and he asked me like is it like a lecture performance i was like i didn't think about it um it could be i mean it could be what you but you do it's like a lecture performance it's completely framed like that yeah so i was like hmm that could be interesting too and then i was like that's true but i think so so at the performance because of the you know sound issue i did talk a little bit of the background and you know the sound is not working so um i said that but i didn't really make it into extra performance because i knew that it's like when i start to like talk it becomes a lecture and it can be like it can be you know um uh received as a mixture of performance but for me it's not a performance anymore because how i speak and how i like project myself is like they are totally different so two different things i mean i speak and i project myself but that's like how do i say i need to really like be be myself it's it's like i don't know like like how i do lecture and how i perform is different because when i perform it's it's not like it's it's still i don't know like it's still my subjectivity but it's still yeah but also like i want to be not myself in a way like i don't know what um i i didn't really prepare to think about these things but um at least i think partially are related of that what you said i mean from the time that i experi i share with you in germany because it's true like i mean i met you just sharing this this space and then in the talks and the dogs were just late you know using the talks and and then it's com it's true that in the way i i perceive you then it's like you can be almost aggressive you know in a positive sense like you're you're very uh into the performance when you're doing the performance like you're gone sometimes you know that you're gone and what you're doing um and then why in for instance like when we were in germany i thought that you were when you wanted no then you were very articulate and very uh i don't know like very composed in like you know if they ask you to talk you know for for the tv or something you were performing something completely different you know like you were very articulating and playing the role that they were proposing you very uh composed you know like while when you're performing then you're wild you know then you're just like the articulate like you don't really in my experience and what you're doing like you i guess you articulate i guess but i mean i don't i yeah i understand i mean that's what i wanted to say yeah yeah so so it's i think to me it's actually addressing some or articulating something maybe it's the same but it's just totally different ways and that's why like i don't want to mix them up you know like if i'm prepared to like to feel to becoming you know this wild moment or whatever to you know actually perform then i cannot do it in the lecture performance because that's like out on the other side of the the spectrum in a way although they are like both myself and doing myself so um what i would say is yeah so i just like before i start the performance on friday i just decided that maybe i can talk talk for like a few minutes but like i won't talk during the performance because that will just break the the rhythm and you know flow and i think i did talk in the middle i mean after like i don't know 10 minutes or 15 minutes because i wanted to fix the sound but i failed so i just said you know just play whatever music you like and just share it in the chat so because i don't i won't see the chat i won't uh play music so you know just find your find your favorite music that fits to my performance i don't know if i was like you proposed that yeah yeah i said that okay yeah did you and what did you what did you heard back i i didn't see the chat i mean i did see that um i didn't see that uh i think someone was saying like some names of songs but i i didn't really remember i mean i didn't recognize anyways so so um that's that was that but i i i enjoyed it like when i just just decided you know not bother with the be bothered with the sound uh like playing with hydra and movements and so fun and i even like i discovered something that um it's a bit technical but if you press ctrl enter in hydra that evaluates the line right yes and if you do ctrl shift enter that evaluates the whole thing will compile the whole thing yeah so if you have like one line that writes to let's say the buffer zero and the second line also writes to buffer zero but different uh effect and if you move the cursor to the first line and you ctrl enter then it becomes the first line but if you ctrl shift enter then it evaluates the you know from the top so the second line overwrites the first one when you do when you do what so you do so you have two lines yes and the cursor is like each other next to each other like referring to the same buffer yeah and the cursor is on the first line yeah and if you do ctrl enter then it's the first line because it only evaluates that line but if you evaluate the whole file then the second one gets the priority because it just goes from the top yeah yeah and i mean that's that's simple i i know it i understand but then i accidentally found it that uh because i have this uh wireless keyboard so i was just like holding this and pressing ctrl enter and ctrl shift enter while i'm moving so i can change the effect while i'm moving and not in front of the computer and that was just fun like you know i had one effect that shows the real-time camera feed and then do the other one that freezes myself but you know like blends into the background wow and but it was because it was overriding the the it was over writing and you were not expecting to override no i just found it like accidentally and then i was like just i just loved it and then i was playing with it for like a few minutes between yeah yeah and this is like i mean i think this is really nice thing about you know like improvisational performance because i wouldn't really expect that to happen if i if everything was set um yeah but then now i feel that i i kind of started to get interested in making a instrument or something like a controller because if i had it you know in my hand for example to switch between effects then that'll be like you know it gives more freedom to move but then at the same time i'm just thinking like is that what i want for this practice yeah but the but i think that could be different and that would be interesting from my friend mates you remember i asked you at some point if it was possible in hydra to work with a midi controller it was because this there was somebody who asked me like do you think it's possible and then i just ask you then afterwards i didn't ask you because i was just reflecting like yeah but hydra is basically it's just code so even if you find some midi it will have to do every single time compile the whole thing uh if it's from midi controller but if is in somehow if you map that to yeah could be a midi controller or a keyword the the the shortcuts the the valuation uh commands then you have the i mean it doesn't have to be a midi controller it could be just a keyword so it could be a custom made tool that it has just two buttons three buttons like the but they will once you press them they will just generate that uh number of commands together i see yeah thinking out loud yeah that sounds sounds interesting huh so that's very specific that's very specific you know like then it's just something very specific you know yeah i mean i think it's interesting if we can you know like change the effects or like even yeah like just hack it while we're practicing or something that would make sense i think if it doesn't really make sense if it's you know just always triggering the same effects and uh just you know everything is set like that or you have to compose beforehand that's you know well i don't know but what could be interesting is like try to share a space or maybe we can try one of these sessions to try how to say that to then like use a space where we still have our two screens but maybe we have the that we can interac we can alter the the other ones background would that be possible in the new version of of how it's called like the like the collaborative hydra how it's called uh pixel drag or flock would be that possible to do in the play in that one in something like that if you want to use green key okay yeah like yeah so you're like so whatever i write will uh influence my background and your background yeah yeah but then the idea still will be to have two compositions you know like because otherwise we're just working in a because if i understand well like this pixel jam is one one third you know like it's just something in between you and me but then my idea will be if it's possible to have this pixel jam in you and in me you know like somehow then we can still put uh create a composition like or with a green key or with the elements that normally we use but we have still a possibility to change something i don't know if it makes sense so so uh pixel jam is not available at the moment and this other guy who's making vlog uh look yes look that uh what were you guys using the hydra meeting yeah like it was doing the you know like four uh compositions but i think you can just change the number of screens in that so probably you can just do one and also like we can make different rooms so for example we make two rooms and uh one room is you know full screen just one buffer i mean one hydra screen and you can decide which one to show it could be something i don't know that's actually that could be interesting like i will say this is something that i would like to continue every next time this is something that uh about curatorial process this did we start this is lo at the tiny beat like when in back in germany this uh talking about the correctorial process with my beautiful stage design for or for our performance um that i think is interesting i think it's interesting uh and it's so it's so it's actual so it's very is very actual to what is happening uh it's very practical as well i think for like for real to have these skills in what is for in the world that we're living but on top of all of this i think could be fun i think could be fun because already we have been working with other elements so so then we are used to work in these frameworks you know like uh yeah could be i think could be interesting like to talk like let's say to try to put a meeting where we talk and try to propose something uh concrete and then try that uh one day like soon after we talk uh because i think this that conversation about curatorial processes i think that could be interesting because now i'm working for my my final work as well for the school and uh as well i'm working with seeds this project uh um the kovit is back so like we have to start thinking already like building thinking in virtual semi-virtual all these kind of things while still working with physical so all these things i think that would be nice to talk like how we see that and the best practice you see how we see that in the best practices uh yeah i mean because a part of like i think still we we we should keep our best like oh the practice you know as we do um but i think we should try to find a time to talk a bit of the [Music] for this what does it mean like uh to propose one one practice in another space uh yeah basically basically that and what does that mean and why yeah you can also go back to hubs the greenhouse and yeah it's still open yeah i checked it i checked it the last the last week weekend was still working it's still working so so we need to create another stage design and you call me i make these beautiful ones in this you even have a firefox mozilla yeah yeah i still have fire from yeah yeah so yeah yeah so there you go um and also like we should really also like think about like you know extending this invitation to someone some people could be also interesting i mean i don't want to like make it too much work for organization but uh maybe just you know if there's anyone interested to work with who's watching this video like to watch what do you mean like the to watch the practice or to to be part of the conversation about the curatorial or to be part of the practice whatever i don't know i'm just just randomly saying i mean not random but uh i don't know i think i think i i will be up for be keeping it open for anybody like to join like a conversation uh but then until we don't define a space let's say for reason like there is i think will be completely okay if somebody wants to join the practice let's say in hubs because already the space is defined there is no hierarchy in the way how the screens work because we will be maybe just another screen uh but then for instance in the in the framework how we have it right now is basically i'm using your images so if there's a third person that is a bit like oh who um it might be kind might work as well i might not i don't know i i think better i think before starting that going that direction i will said i would like to talk about what like of this what i mean but i i i mentioned exploratorial processes like going towards that direction a bit uh yeah yeah and then and then once we know okay let's try this then sure we can try different things and it could be sessions you know like now we have been so we have best practices but we can have best practices session hops best practices sessions uh pixel jam best practices uh i don't know like in the policy stations and i don't know the first practice in the jail it sounds really different anyways um yeah as the police like can i have my laptop for a second i have a meeting with nine okay i'm gonna stop the recording here because i'm getting sleepy and okay", "g0FhT62XBwQ": "i mean we were like you know like when we met we were like i was always complaining that we cannot record the conversation because we're just talking you know i mean we can have like a recorder but that's just like yeah it's up to us yeah but i think at this point whatever whatever whatever so are you what are you i'm in dortmund at a friend's place because i'm working in the theater dortmund and the yeah the thing you said yesterday was double rafael [Music] yeah that was very cool i think it was super cool how did you how did you what were you using to do that so it's it's something that he's been doing quite a lot um it's basically the camera is connected to the projector the camera is connected to a live a camera normal camera yeah so it's just like you know projecting what's seeing and the camera is also looking at the projection so it makes the feedback so the camera is pointing at the projector yeah he's recording it's recording the image that is from the camera from the car he's recording the image from the projector yeah which is coming from the camera this is coming from the camera so but then but then you were moving the camera slightly basically yeah oh cool i'm gonna try that i thought i i thought i was thinking maybe that was with obs you were just like moving the window over yes ah that would work too but it wouldn't make this you know like kind of glowing effect ah because the uh yeah from where comes the blue from the light i think it does like this dynamic range or maybe because of focus i don't know because so that blue actually is it's just the light it's just the light that the the camera is having because it looks somehow that is define it it looks like light from the stage but it's just the camera the the light of the camera is catching yeah i think the side lights are not that blue like it's more like orange i think they have so well i don't remember but anyways the the bluish color is probably like because i think white balance there's like a you know if you use camera appears too orange sony something like you know it's like a like a big one like for uh video like proper video recording i like like a really good camera like not the not even a dls are but just like a recorder recording professional recording camera yeah like for streaming streaming or yeah like for like a tv kind of well not tv but you know like the ones that they use in note these kind of cameras a bit smaller than that but like in that range you know like yeah direction cool that was the effects was it was wonderful it was beautiful the uh thanks was beautiful there yeah so then you i could imagine so you're behind so you were doing the choreography behind you're moving sorry so you're doing like like this and if you if you move it too much you will it up yeah that would be so funny i mean there was so much pressure do you feel stressed because what if you are nervous and you are like but it's a big camera now it's not a small camera so you really have to move it yeah so what happens was that it's it's quite big so i tried to like hold it at first but it's like it really shakes so i we ended up just putting on the stage and i was just like you know turning a bit but that's enough because it's it's quite far so just like moving a bit makes a lot of you know uh so but the camera the camera is not really really in front how is not really in front how how much is the distance between the projector and the camera i mean the whole stage because i was so i well i was sitting in the you know front row of the audience and then when the show started i just walked there and started moving it and the stage is quite big i don't know how much like more than 10 meters i don't know what how it's i don't have the sense of distance in this theater oh wait no i get lost again so what is so but there was an image that was projector it so it was using a projector it was it was a projection and so if rafael is here like if if this is the if this is the the square and this is the back this is the this is the back so here's where where it's projecting and rafael is in here dancing yeah where is the camera it's here yeah i mean on the edge of the stage you have the edge of the stage pointing to him yeah and that also you know goes to the projection so at the same time so is his map sort of saying that it will it will go in the angle catching part of the of the projector yeah so i have to move it adjust it so that you know in the image for example raphael is here but also the projection looks like behind him then it becomes like bigger and bigger depending how yeah what's about this trick you know it is yeah it's super tricky because they so the effect is wonderful but then you have to well quite millimetric in how much you move because if you move it if you move it too much i mean sometimes you have this effect or you have the it's funny because you were actually you're doing analog something that you do like digital no so you were like mirroring sometimes then you put it here and then the image goes there but that's so cool because the same time you could see i mean physically how the how that that actually happens yeah i mean it's it's his idea and like we we tried it already like last year in hong kong together and that's why he asked me to do it again because i think we kind of you know like it went uh really well when we were in hong kong and this time as well so um yeah you just have to know the geometry of you know where if you look at a point where then image will look like what i just like you know i don't calculate but i can kind of estimate how things will be yeah it's a bit like something that i found really interesting and it's part of the things part of like the tricks sort of saying that that i want to research in in in the works that i'm doing for the school but like yeah i'm like digitally yeah yeah and it's like that it's it's well it's digital but it's not like you know uh involving like programming or any technical things it's just like camera and projector hooked up together and that's it but but then what i'm missing there actually is like the beauty because you have such i mean you have such a that's a craftsman so you you're actually crafting something and then is missing you know then somehow is missing because like there is there is a craft there that i think i would like to see somehow you know like to to see that actually it's happening in that way because that's it's something there is very special like they ca how they and i mean nobody not too much people will still do something like that rather you will try to do just effects with somehow and so becomes because now it's such a rare tea i as a as a public i would like to see somehow that you know like but it does become something different you know like to somehow to address that that is happening you know like you or the person with the camera or the camera itself it becomes part of the of the piece as well but that's that then becomes the piece something else you know then it's not what he's doing then the piece becomes something in relation with the technology in the space you see then maybe it's because my my i mean it's just because we are talking of this and maybe because we have this interest and then i think of wow then i found like actually it's like cinderella is like something that is hitting that i would like to see her and she's behind i would like to see her face but what i didn't get is like so you thought wait i didn't really get it uh well yes and no so you said because of like lack of technology or like what what did you want to say actually i sorry i don't i don't remember i mean what i was trying crafting yeah so what i was trying to say is like this crafts craftsman i don't know how he told to call like craftsmanship craftsmanship craftsmanship uh that's that's something that i will see i would consider something like that craftsmanship something like uh that work within because it's still there's the element there is a i mean it's a camera it's an electronic and it's digital so but it still is it's not it's an analog uh machine is it's not it's not it's not yeah you know what i mean so because of with the movement and stuff yeah because this is that that's not actually because what is happening with the object is that the object is being hacked that object is not to be used in that way so because of and a part of that is being hacked it has this rarely rarity of that's what i was mentioning the cinderella i see it as a princess that's something that is a wonderful element it's not just a dsl kind of camera that you know you would buy to take picture it's a it's a special camera and that as well that i guess it will not be the state-of-the-art camera but it still is like these cameras i think that's the beauty of these cameras that because the technology is for what people are using them is not so different right now you can still use all cameras and you i mean if you compare you cannot use that old computers you know computers advance very fast so you cannot keep them for so long a camera of these kinds you can keep them for long because the case of use is still is very similar um when they were created so because of that something of this is becoming somehow vintage but at the same time i think it's something that you can still use it for the same purpose that it was created 10 years ago 15 years ago 20 years ago which is not the case with many things in technology i see okay now i start to understand what you mean but then if you do that then approach as well it becomes something different you know like the piece itself if you talk then as the piece it it becomes something different it's not the the wonderful the piece that he proposed i don't know i mean i i suppose part of his texts and some things but it for any way for the thing that i saw in the five minutes is something that is is i think it works so taking that approach you know working in in such a way with the with the element because becomes that object that is not a technical support but uh another uh element in this in the space that now is not being considered space that is completely different you know true it changes the dynamic of the of the intention of what he wants as choreographer what uh i mean it's so it's such it's such a compromise because if you put up like the pro that problem doesn't happen with the uh cello player because the cello player for instance is a he's a person you know so it will not is is not sacrificing uh it actually is part of the space already is something that is poetic somehow and it still is rafael is human and the other one is human so even though he is playing with the cello it is in the space while if you put something that is a camera yeah they are they're they're not the two are not equal but they are equally there yeah i think so yeah and the camera is something different yes okay so in that proposition yes but can you think uh like if you just try to imagine then hold that camera up and then be go inside of the space i mean the thing is like the intention of the cro as the choreographer as as as the director of the maker of the piece it has to change drastically in the intention maybe the camera even doesn't have to change that much but just like why didn't why why the camera is there it demands so much uh from the making you know in the making it's for you as creator like why the camera has to be there well yeah i mean to me it's i i see it really i think it's i see it really different because i already worked with him with this video feedback so it's it's something very how do i say different also like when we tried it it was um it was just like it was just for uh between us and he wanted to you know film something it's not in front of audience but we're just in a studio and trying out but he had the text which was not about uh not about his daughter but [Music] maybe it was something similar actually but it was different text that he was saying in front of the camera and but he was dancing like in a similar way and because of this experience i like i don't i don't know how i pers perceived that performance but it definitely different from how you perceived the performance and how you perceive the objects or the people in this i mean two people on the stage and the camera i think something that is i remember i just i remember like that's something that like martin i remember he told me when i was working on this sort and he was helping me he says because i was a bit nervous for something and then he asked me he see he was asking like did you did that he was asking me somehow like i don't remember exactly his words but he was asking me if i did that before basically because i was nervous or something i was nervous for what i was doing and presenting um and then so i said no so then he was saying there you go so anything that you do will be good it will be it will be the best because then there is no point for other one to compare so the first so the first proposal that you had that you do in certain framework it's always it will be there is no there is no chance of failing on that uh of this it will be always succeeding because there is no com compare yeah there is not a compare reference there is no reference point exactly and then i was i was thinking of that because of what you said and then uh there is always this contradiction only when you work with comp with i guess with performances and stuff like that because in one hand there is a natural evolution of how you work and you build a creature that is the performance so you you get relation between the people and the elements that you work with while for instance an external person it can come and i just see [Music] everything flat you know or like for us in my i will assume that things are in certain way and then easily i will just disconnect or connect the pieces you know because for me are flattened because i don't have uh connection with the with the creation yeah yeah but it's really interesting point because i think it's also like why we do the practice and not the performance because it kind of i mean weird how do you say it it's i think it's like both that we're like trying to make no reference in a way because it's improvised but at the same time we're making so much reference points by doing this over and over yeah like the usually what and what i grow today i put in capital sometimes they practice the practice i saw it and i was thinking that in a way i feel similar to how i experience people when they do capoeira so like you know what is capoeira yeah it's like so and then you have like really just they all all people they play in a really different way and basically is because the whole point of the capoeira is that you is so he's not that dance but it's well it's not a martial art it's something that is in between and always you have this uh intention of this is the other one constantly like a monkey so you're constantly teasing that i'm going here but no now i hit you here and you're constantly playing with this uh you're faking you're doing things constantly to play with the other one like you're monkeying the person around and that basically when it when they're with all people or yeah people who are working that for many years they basically they just build a book of tricks basically how to trick you that just you will know on the on the yeah just with the experience and and the thing with something like that is that i see it like similarity in what we do with the practices because you have um [Music] yes like you're you're they're making your own tricks you know like unconsciously you know there are things that can work which is which is very similar actually it does very similar to the act of dance in dancing like uh there is something called instant composition people talk about that like david sambran is one of the i don't know he was one of the first one who really was teaching uh it's called instant composition which is uh is the idea that you improvise but actually you're composing what you're improvising so as you're not just improvising but you're being conscious that what you are doing is composing which is different because you need to have a you need to get out of you need to have be aware of what you're doing not just doing doing doing like so it's not linear but you need to have reference point of being out that's why that's why it's very important for him like to stop that's something i learned from him you need to stop and to know what is happening to have these reference points of of what you're doing and and i think it's somehow it seems to me that what we do is is a bit like that in the sense that we like we try to go in the flow of just being doing but at the same time we know that we want to do things you know so that's the play constant play between like i want to make a beautiful and cool image that i will post in facebook but at the same time i should be doing trying to get in the flow and make no sense what i'm playing with these and there's constantly these things going back and forward yeah like let's i think that's also something i think about like live coding and like don't know like if i think we talked about this post-coding idea that i was saying but and also like you know like going repeat it again is that you have a post coding again well i think it's it's basically about like not being really productive about coding because you know like i'll just say it again but basically coding is made for productivity and people save everything every single change and that's because you know it's made for running servers and you know specific hardware drivers and stuff so it's not you know you don't want to improvise something with that kind of program um but i think life coding what it's interesting is it's really it's not just like ephemeral but um oh i'm i'm losing words and ideas uh but it's it's about like habit and you know like you create something and you just erase everything afterwards i mean people some people say that but some people don't keep it and to me it's interesting to just like you know don't not to have the the the archive of live coding i mean it could be video but it not as a text because that's just like you know trying the idea of um like following the idea of productivity but if we just forget about it and just have fun but more like you know but still you compose something you have to be conscious about what you're doing and it's not just changing numbers but you start to like um yeah like compose different effects and then it becomes your trick right basically and i think that's really interesting aspect of that so that's it's no longer like copy and paste but or saving in git or version control but it's it becomes more part of your your practice yeah can i say something totally different irrelevant yes um yeah so i i actually [Music] no because i i thought it's it's really nice that um we just started talking and just started recording because this is how it should be and when we're at node like it always felt like so difficult to start this conversation because we're in this greenhouse and you know it was like we have this from i don't know like 1 30 to 2 30 and some people are watching and you know this was like it it's not this chat was not like that you know it's just like more random chat and it's not like supposed to like show it to people i mean we are showing in it to people but you know i i don't know what i'm saying i think that i mean it way by the way wait by the way this is this works very good now i mean just i just checked the the image the it's really it's not bad for i mean i have no green keys just the camera yeah um wait what why are we saying oh about this chat about this chat i mean it's so weird that yeah it's difficult to i think that is i mean i'm always i'm like in a few years i'm trying to do that all the time don't know why trying to go in processes they're not like that the nature is not going in that direction like for instance it's like in like this is one example but we do with these best practices and so this is one of the things but i have been always doing like since few years don't know why i have this i feel somewhat how some magnetism they always attract me to do things that are going in opposite directions um because so then in the what we try to do is in a way i think when we talk about this in a way it's like we try to ho it's like we try to de-articulate something uh no actually we try to articulate something that is uh the articulate by by the the proposals that we the framework that we work uh in the in the practice is not articulate and somehow we i mean we have some minimal boundaries but in a way we try to just be there with the best practices right yeah so but then in somehow when we do when we try to talk is that somehow we we need we found in we need we need this moment to talk [Music] um i mean we need i mean it's weird because for instance like for me it was in my head like i know like i i want like i'm really tired like like you're tired like but so it's important for me that is somehow it's like it feels when you go to the i uh i did that with my grandma go to the church and you confess your scenes basically to the to the priest you go and you confess like these are the things that i need to confess like but you know it's like it like it's the secret like i need to tell you and this happened and this happened uh it feels to me that is there is a is like a necessity to share something that i don't understand but because we share the experience then it might make me feel a bit a bit a bit better than if i share it with you you know my this thing that makes no sense to me i see no i see yeah yeah i mean but that's that's like the you know the round after moving in the dance studio kind of yeah yeah yeah wait it's a bit different though is it i mean because i think like because in both spaces you're talking about that's intimacy basically that's the intimacy that you're you're there's a space when you're being in team and actually it's because you are excited you need to speak out you know you're not going to do that at that moment because you're being if you've been moving and doing something then you are very sensible at that moment and [Music] you need to put it out and it's funny i think this is interesting from what we're what we're doing this in my head this idea of that like you need that's very similar to the process that i do with my psychologist it's very similar try to articulate something that it comes from feelings you know i mean comes from really deep inside try to put some words and yeah you try to articulate something like that i don't know i see it as a space i see the simulator between these two spaces because of the of the intimacy i don't know how you see it but we also like did like because i don't know what was the the um conclusion because we said you know we wanted to chat right after the practice and we did a few times and then we decided not to do that i mean just you know i i don't think we have like a time we made a statement about this but it's just like we tried and we're kind of sticking to that for now yeah i mean i don't know what you do but for instance like already i was thinking of that like when i finish the practices because now i'm waking up early every day because of the school  with the school then i every time i finish the practice i'm uh i'm i'm i'm my energy's like so uh so normally what i was doing in the last few weeks before i go we we went to frankfurt it's like i go to the forest that is go it's not far away from here so i will take my message like for myself like up to two hours to to chill down somehow because i'm so on fire i'm in fire um i'm at this energy so i was thinking that i cannot do that i need to find already i was thinking i'm kind of practicing thinking in the practice like i need to find a way how to put me down fast i cannot spend two hours going to the forest so i need to start pushing trying things knowing the way my spirit i need to try to test start testing uh yeah so i will see like so this thursday this thursday we do a practice now yeah i mean my schedule is a bit weird but uh i think thursday is good or yeah thursday or the weekend for me with work yeah he's okay he's the boss good in the weekend or on thursday let's do let's do it on thursday yeah i have like thursday like i start started nine and i finished like literally non-stop at 7 30. oh well non-stop from nine uh but i was i would put it like i put it there so i mean you know wait i'm mixing these different things all because i'm tired my brain is working a bit like like jumping so but i was thinking that so we went to frankfurt and before we didn't met we didn't met in person no you're asking for what like no no i mean this is weird because somehow i'm kind of reflecting that maybe somebody will hear this no so it's kind of like thinking as a person so like before frankfurt like we didn't met just we have this space and for me it's i was like so now we are talking and i was thinking that like the space before uh like before we go to frankfurt and then frankfurt and then this is not so different i don't know how how you feel how you feel that but i i feel that this so that this is not i mean a part of half you know maybe a bit i feel a little bit more that maybe we strain some some things because then i could see you and share some space i mean a part of note was wonderful like i mean the whole experience and things are part of this like normal it's good soup every night oh my god i refuse the last two days the last today i say i'm not gonna have that shitty zoo this time i know i remember yeah but what i didn't remember was like so thursday night thursday night i said like  this soup i'm going for the sausage and then yeah and then on friday i said uh  the lunch i i'm at night so then from thursday i didn't eat the soup and then friday not lunch and then then we went for the sausage that was i mean that was a thursday actually thursday's the last day aya yes wednesday enters yeah so wednesday yeah wednesday i went to have this hamburger night okay the hamburger yeah i don't know like that so yeah for the question is like don't you think this the space i mean a part of this like very specific things you know but the space is not so different you know like now that we talk yeah like um it's it's weird to say it but did you watch the video that people are like waving hands and i i watched it and i was like i saw you in the video and i was like oh yeah he was there in frankfurt i'm not saying that you know i i'm not saying that i forgot that you were there but it's just like yeah i was just staying here that we're in the same space [Music] that's that's very weird that's very weird i don't know i because because i'm doing this work about dimensionality for my school for one year and that's something that in somehow is not consciously but it's unconscious it has a big impact like what the you know like because the whole thing is very weird you know like really like what the like so you really go like you go and like then you you share the space really intense one one week uh even the key because we have just one key so you have to really be like like a bubble you know like really like then share everything and and then and then you did you but there is something that is weird because what i was trying to share because in somehow i don't know it's like the space that we establish some space or some reality that we built during the yeah during few months i mean before like all the time since april until a year so this is not this is not weird this is just normal and so this is actually what i'm trying to say i guess is this is reality you know like then i talk with you this is normal for me and then then when we were for one week in frankfurt that's actually real life you know that's a three-dimensional space that's real so that's what normally you would consider real like um but in somehow that there is a glitch in between these two is two space to to to atmospheres that i think it should be documented for me somehow i need to find the time and space like to grind what does it mean but it certainly there is something special in that because it's not this is not the same space the one you are next with somebody you know it's not the same space so it should i don't know like i think naturally it should be some on balance in between like when you are in person or when you are in the virtual space like there should be a a rough i mean it's a different dimension it's not the same but i think i didn't think about this but i feel the whole node was a bit like you know a bit dreamy and it was not like you know it was physical but at the same time it was surreal and maybe is especially during this time that festival happens like that you think could be as well because you were a lot in the virtual space well i don't know i i was thinking about it but i really don't know like if it was not like that but still like because anyways we were meeting in person and you know but i feel like what was really made it like surreal was that the whole festival thing somehow maybe the people maybe the space i don't know but it made it you know like it to me it didn't really feel like like it really happened in real life i mean i think somehow i i mean maybe i'm getting paranoid but like somehow i'm thinking starting there is a complaint for the government i don't know i'm thinking that there is something weird in in everything there is something that is not natural in the in the way ho we as humans are entering in dimmer in different spaces meaning like virtual spaces i think there is something that is like i think they're under layers that uh they have to be greeting or like i don't know it's like don't know it's like it's not real i don't know i'm getting paranoid i'm not going to die not real real this is not real this is not real no yeah i mean we can we can stop the recording now just to you know finish it i mean not finish the conversation but i'm gonna stop recording", "msol2jjAmP0": "test test test i can't hear you for some reason i can oh wait no uh yes i cannot hear you and try something it's not because of him yeah hello hello no uh when you speak there is no yeah you you're not there is no sound coming from your from yeah from now um [Music] do you hear sound i hear the sound effects yeah do it then [Music] yeah now i hear you hey you can if you can uh oh i don't know what are you but the microphone yeah if you come close and i can hear you better yeah that's another thing i'm just going to open my camera then okay right whatever okay i hear you good and i have i'm recording this as well okay here we are we are doing our discussion about the best practice and i guess we can start talking about what just happened yesterday right what just happened yeah i mean i i don't know like it's it's hard like to where to start with but i guess yeah i guess i just don't have to think about who's listening so i'll just just say whatever like we do regularly yeah it was great um now i can say it was great i was so s oh you're gone you were stressful like one thing was that we are for the first time i'm losing you not sure because your video is i'm not sure if it's like um now just let's try i mean uh if it happens again okay so yeah can you repeat what you just said because i was not hearing you you're frozen now so i guess i'm frozen for you then speed yeah okay hey hey test yep feedback can you hear me now yeah i can hear you again okay i'm sorry i think the connection is not so good here and where are you no uh i'm putting my image on the stage and yeah what i mean physically where are you in the in the in the building but i connect to other network okay in my mobile and that should work yeah that should be workflow yeah yeah all right so yeah so i just started from the beginning um what happened yesterday yeah so i i was stressed because of two reasons one was that um it was public for the first time because we when we did practice it's always we do recording and if the video becomes public later right and the other thing is that we are performing for practicing in this space this hubs and that just added more complexity to it so like for the first like half an hour i was just it was just playing and but i think that the moment when i started to see people leaving that was that was a great moment for me that i can yeah like it's just liberating you know i can do whatever i want because i don't have to think about people watching yeah which is kind of ironic but i think it's it's kind of the it's kind of the you know  i mean for me i will i will i i would rather said more than it's not for showing something i agree with you but then i will like to say more is uh to share something then uh so yeah i completely yeah what so if uh so what happened is normally just we do as we are doing now that we're just sharing but because of the technical issues i mean because there is this virtual space and then just uh it takes time to put it correctly and then there were some people that were moving the screens and all these things that you can basically not control so i think that's one one topic there is yeah this idea of the control comes really often and i think one of the reasons that became so messy is because we have less control if one when we do it just you and me the whole point of not doing solos is because we relate to this idea of the control like not having control over what the other person is gonna do and then when you put that and that's just you and me doing the same framework then when you put it in a stage like here and then people can walk around and because it's the virtual space that allow you to put objects move objects do different kind of things it just becomes uh yeah becomes a lot no and uh but yeah so i think it's uh the way i perceive was that i think we both but i think energetically i felt that we both were similar states like the first 20 minutes or something like that we we that will be interesting as well if for somebody who is here then we will post it uh on my facebook wall and then on autos wall then we can see what happened there but we because what i felt is that we both were energetically wise the same like the first time was frustration because things were not working normally we work with this live lab so based on live lab uh actually this is the first time that we actually didn't use the image uh of the other person in our own screens right it's the first time yes yeah that's the first time so live love is something that allowed us to share our screens and then we will send this composition i will send it to naoto and then now otto will do something with that composition and then he will send me his image uh with some composition and then we do this feedback loop back and forward constantly and then glitches happen and then we mix with the most the movement and that's basically what is what it happens on but then yesterday a live lab was not working it's the first time and then we were both like okay it's not working and it was like it was the time where people were seeing that and as you said normally there is we we don't do it live streaming but we share it afterwards so at that moment there was people in the room and then as yes you said because they can be physical then you can see the avatars of the names and then you get more i was more nervous when i see some names uh yeah yeah hmm you don't and you don't know yeah and you don't know yeah without any interaction so i'm just like putting myself here but don't know what's happening like except that i have my phone which has the you know the group with the organizers and so if there is something wrong they can just text me but otherwise i have to just trust them and just if i don't have the your camera feed and i'm just working with my camera feed that's also okay because i'm quite used to hydra or the light coating so that was okay but i would say i wasn't really confident using no sound because i also decided not to use sound because that was already too much for my computer and that's why i at one point i think i i told you you know just played some music because i just felt like we needed something oh now i can't hear you i think you just changed the audio interface somehow because you're using a microphone so i guess while you're trying i can just uh continue on my reflection so yeah i think again like going back to the the first thing i said like there were two things that made it really different different from our usual practice um i think it's good and it's i don't know like but this is like also like kind of to me it was weird situation because i think it was clear like like it was clearer if it's something that someone asked us to do a performance in some kind of you know festival or conference then then i would think that okay we have to do something um more something that we feel more comfortable or even just you know use the um recorded version or something because it's then it becomes you know yeah suddenly we are like responsible for like so many things you know part of the festival and his audience and yeah um but for us it was something that it was like half official because it was in the program of the festival and but at the same time something we proposed and with that yeah with that it was fine and i think well i think if you're in for example like um practicing dance maybe there's like places where you can show something like this you know like that it's like it can be work in progress or it's something that is not like uh you're not sure if it really works fine or not but in digital art i think it's way like these opportunities are way less than in dance what do you mean like to like where you can fail actually like you know like okay yeah yeah okay i mean because it's also like with this weird tension that for example in like visual art like in a sense of you know more like classical context where people you know show things in a gallery sculpture painting or something in between or whatever it's you know it's technically it's hard to fail like well if you have something like mechanical or something with projection you might be it's possible to you know technically fail but there is something that that can be shown and but but for digital art media art it's if if it's not functional then it's it's it's not a artwork because you know they have to put the sign that uh it's under you know maintenance or something and suddenly it becomes just an object and a lot of peace so that's why i feel we have this kind of like kind of we have to yeah like make it perfect like perfectionism in this field that it has to work otherwise you yeah it's not work you cannot fail in a sense i mean i thought like uh i'm gonna repeat something that i just said because i some time ago i then my microphone was mute so uh because it's part of the same thing that we are talking so is again because the format that we propose is uh in a way that doesn't have a gold uh it's just what we propose is the practice then the we encounter ourselves ourselves with a failure in terms of like it was not so cool as we expected somehow because already there's some expectation that we had and we even have some stage design with this and we make the put the we'd have a tech rehearsal where things were working and they were working even super good and then then yeah so again so what i was trying to say is that um that is important to be uh uncomfortable for a little bit i mean that i can feel myself that i can be uncomfortable in in let's say that was the space the performance and i can be in that uncomfortable for a little bit if i believe that that's giving so much space for other things to happen and in this case it's just because i believe that what we do is just opening spaces where things don't have to be binary in the sense of like one thing is the things are just one thing or the other thing uh so just opening spaces as such and then connected what you were saying is that um the the way i see it is big in terms of technology when you work with the then digital art or art classical art visual arts or dance uh but i think it makes it more harsh with the limits in terms of working of not working is because one is like is technological based so that's one constraint that you have and the system is binary anyway so let's say in terms of like or over electricity it will if they let's say if we are based our performances with a computer there is plug to the socket if at that moment the electricity is gone everything is gone because that's the nature of the electricity um but and then in relation to and that is portrayed uh and because of that so the aim is very specific and then the system uh allows or let's say uh will think that something is good or productive only when it's not failing and and is making money basically uh yeah so yeah again so basically there are these two ideas no this one uh one about the this idea the new media technology is uh is because of the nature of itself comes from design and engineering it has this binary approach uh of let's say just binary constraints in terms of electricity but in a way i see there is portrayed and or is being monetized in the system meaning that you will get more money as more things you can make more impressive something can be and that but then in the other side that's where we are more it's like we work towards something that we tried we said and we have been talking in this conference with not only us but uh allah for instance that she's the one who's closing the festival tomorrow and part of the her proposition is about the same is uh about the critique of the system itself through her performance so and then so then we are in in the space i believe there is so yeah the the opening spaces in between the the because we are not contemporanes we are not art we work with uh technical elements we we work with them so we cannot set is not binary because we are there um but at the same time we are not completely at the other extremes so we are in between somehow because we use dance then contemporary dance elements and then we try to evolve this the these concepts through discussions and then the technological part but then so it's not one thing or the other one it's just something in between and then just we tried to it became it started as a joke no it was for us best practices no from best practices coming from this idea best practices in coding so then best practices in contemporary dance as well as an inside joke and then we are just in this space in between yeah then i maybe i wanted to ask you something then um then is uh okay so what do you think it was positive of the note of yeah of the of the what do you think was positive of the moment itself what do you mean sorry i couldn't hear you like um maybe let me try to explain my uh to re ask you through myself with an explanation like one of the things that i could enjoy that i could not have done if i because now to me we are together we are in the same space so we are even though now we are in different spaces in the in the building because the other one would be weird the same computer but we are in the same space physically and it was the first time that we were trying this after six months and then what i was trying to uh ask you was more in relation to what was positive of of the income of the physical encounter was there something positive yeah um that's a good question and actually like i think this is kind of uh like one of the biggest questions like because we have been working remotely together and then suddenly we came like we met for the first time and then we did this practice together in a physically insane space so i know that this is like a big question but to me like i think it's interesting that i didn't really care it didn't really like it wasn't the question for me like i did it was not strange it was not comfortable but it was but i wouldn't say it was natural because it's not natural um but it in a way it didn't bother me the fact that you were there while the first well the first time it then in the first rehearsal that we have it was very strong you know you said that that time you you even were using your headphones the first time right right so that one i didn't want to like feel your presence so i had to like put my headphones on and listen to music um that's right yeah so that was like really like i was feeling that a lot but yesterday it was like for me it was fine like that you were there because i think i was just too overwhelmed by other things other factors that was you know i had to take care of so i didn't really think that i didn't really care you were there i i like we had to like we had really like you know short amount of time set it up in the because it's a workshop room and workshop was happening you know half an hour before yeah you start started so we were just like just putting everything there and just start because it was you know we had to start it on time because that's part of our practice and then i noticed that i forgot to put the green screen and so like yeah yeah you have no mindset like i was just like it was not you know but you left the room at some point i thought you went to the room to take the the green tissue did you because you left the room at some point so so um when i went there it was actually because i um oh yeah because the network was really slow on the wi-fi and i thought okay i have to get i have to connect to my phone for the network like mobile network yeah and that's why i i went back because i know that i knew that i've got the cable in the room because i thought that it's something i don't need for the practice yeah yeah yeah it's actually needed yeah yeah yeah yeah well i mean for me the way i was reflecting of that it was that because yeah so if i see a retrospective in retrospective what happened is like first 20 minutes was like oh my god what is this happening so i'm sure like when we see the recording like it just was really really up at the point of like crying you know like very dramatic like oh my god this is horrible and then slowly i start feeling okay this is what it is and then so i said okay i take care of myself and then i will just start doing things from that and then it's slowly then then for some reason then we start i start feeling ah because then the computer the ghost computer was there the computer then was recording the physical space at the same time and then we have that interaction through that space while still some so then we were dancing as well and then we were projecting towards there so uh it's so it it was something that happened there i mean there's so much things in between because it's like we are doing the thing in our screens right and then but we cannot share that screen so like say normally what it happens is like we do this just two screens and then we do us as xln before but then at that moment we could not because live lab was not working then we were doing our stuff but then at the same time there was the ghost computer the one in between these two and that one was capturing with a wide angle camera the physical space and then we start sometimes dancing there uh and then sometimes and becomes became slowly slowly uh it was gradually grew growing until the moment that we were think yeah i think at some point we break the digital and the physical space and unconsciously and we were just dancing so it's slowly how i see it is like okay so disaster i'm alone then it slowly started interacting because the other camera was there then i see you and these things and then things were from that point they were slowly gradually uh growing up in the in somehow in some in in indirect interaction and then until just we end up going for the dancing and then going really for the dancing then the two physical space complete completely at some point then we when we cross the spaces you end up in my screen i end up in your screen and we were just dancing and going for the flow which was i think the last five minutes at that moment and we never planned something like that i mean that was not part of the game because that's something that we can normally not do i just happened at that moment i think it was more like a i feel like a moment of relief like oh my god let's do something and then just go for it and it was it was an euphoric moment for me i don't know how you felt about it i have to say that it's it's definitely something i like it was like my intention like i didn't plan anything like that but um as we start it was terrific it was just horrible experience at first and then then as soon as because i think the thing was that if there are people from the beginning then i feel that okay i have to do something to the people because they are here for you know watching something yes yes um and so i it it has to be you know this has to really start from the start and but that's then if you think about like this our practice like regular ones it's nothing like that we just like slowly build up and um even if we just do it you know by ourselves it's it takes so long to build up things and maybe there's some like interesting moments happening after 20 minutes or after 30 minutes that's what we are usually there you know there's this climax at the last five or ten minutes and i totally forgot about that fact like i was thinking that yesterday like i have to really like go with the maximum energy from the beginning but that's not possible just you know think right so then i then people start to leave and then i was like okay yeah it's true like i can just you know start to like rather think about you know what not what i can do right now but what's going to happen at the end and then i saw that that computer that was you know in between that you you named it ghost computer that was in between and we're not supposed to touch it i mean that was not our intention but um i thought okay yeah i saw that that computer was like you know the hubs was crashed because of something i don't know probably the network and i was like okay i just open it again but then what if i use hydra on this computer instead of just sharing a video camera because of the webcam because you know we could use that and and actually that computer was uh much more powerful than mine so i was like okay i can just you know start doing things with this and that's where it starts to you know so you know what i was reflecting i was sorry to interrupt i think just now because you were speaking about that i didn't thought of that that's a conscious compositional decision that you took there that's that's a choreographer i mean that's a you consciously so this is happening and then you took the choreographic decision of okay we need that could be happening and then you did it i i mean i was not because i was for me is just as i expressed before i just gradually entering the flow i just at some point i saw that thing was green but you know i didn't but it yeah it was not reflecting that you did it consciously it was consciously conscious decision and i mean of course like again it's not something planned in advance but yeah yeah because it crashed and i have to you know reopen things but then you know what if i just do it um yeah do it with hydra so i can start coding with it and then it becomes really became really interesting for me because i can use two computers here and there and then go there to change something and come back to change something um i have to admit that the filter i mean the effect was a bit too similar between them but still it was quite interesting that i for me it was really interesting that it the coding really became physical because it's not that i'm just holding here but i can go to the other computed code and then come back to code which was something the feeling that i never had before because ow because before but because normally when you use the other computer that you have you don't cope with that you use it more as a secondary something i don't want to touch it it's just for recording i just start recording and that's it right that's the purpose of the second computer but uh yeah this time it was very different and i think it also helps like if i have one desk where every all the equipment is here then probably it's a different experience you know i'm because i don't have to move from here to use different computers or different equipment but it was physically there and i have to come back go back and forth so you physically actually you physically you were forced to you physically were forced to move in that direction and because of that you have i mean you have to see me because you have to keep on doing that for the uh maintaining of the computer the second one that you were using yeah and also yeah also corresponds to the physical uh not the like virtual composition inside hubs that was really interesting yeah yeah yeah okay now i see what you mean with that oh yeah if you will not mention then i wouldn't think of that and i i even thought like maybe i could write code in your computer which i don't think i did no but the last part you should try like you could have tried but i mean this is this is cool i mean the the that just that we have the first experience and as i said like this is an uncomfort space i mean this is a safe space where we could fail and we can try things and so then we could be uncomfortable for a little bit meaning that we can be in the position of oh my god there are people coming and seeing us uh i am okay with for being like that if it's i guess it will be every day well probably maybe if it's a bit less stressful that'll be great because i think because of this organizing unconferences that that's just too much for me but uh yeah uh but but i i agree with what you mean yeah maybe at some point we could try something in the hops uh we we could see like something from time to time you know even once every month once something like that and we will actually what i found is cooling that is that that integrate but that's completely in another direction uh but it integrates the idea of curatorial processes in digital dance basically because then if we use this space for instance then it means that we have to think where the things are going to be and that's a complete that's a that's another thing um yeah yeah it's just it's another thing i see but actually that's really no no that's actually interesting and that's something i even see in the regular practice because you do the screen recording like the whole screen recording right and yeah when i see your recording i see that you're like moving things around like going to another desktop and you know moving window here and there yeah and i try not to do that in my recording i try to you know make it more stable that i have this higher window and maybe tidal cycles here and i just you know try to stick to this composition yeah but this could be also it's a bit like in between stage design and choreography that you can you know play with the arrangement of the windows yeah okay now i see what i mean yeah like yesterday for instance like i did it consciously like normally as you said i will record like or will i share my old holy scream but then then yesterday i thought i will just do hydra to just have a stable just one image there but uh yeah i like it big i don't know if it's consciously or unconsciously it's just there is so much motion no so i think it makes things not easy for myself uh because then i have sometimes yeah i have bdmx then hydra then sometimes i try to put because because my my knowledge of hydra since i haven't spent too much time is limiting some things that i can do like some of the days before i was thinking like maybe i should do something and then i thought no actually i know fewer few elements actually i can count maybe with my one hand but then from those if i combine even tabs together then i have cool stuff um because i just create reverberations or then i use different directions or speeds colors things like this and cameras and other windows and with that already it's a lot so then uh what i yeah but that means that i have i need to have like if i want to do this kind of things i need to have at least two or three hydras and then a part of that i use bdmx and as you know bdmx is basically full of windows so every time that i just do like this and then just this all these small windows just pop up and sometimes i have like could be more than 20 30 small windows all around and and it's what i'm trying to say is in relation to i didn't thought about at all just until now you said because then you we are talking about curatorial processes that is so true that like now i have experience because we have been doing this for many months already and then i don't get so stressed and it's so similar how what will happen to me when i'm uh improvising dancing literally if i already have been improvising with certain elements for a few months i will be panicking the first times but then after a few months i will be okay even though i'm lost and that's what happened yesterday like when when i didn't i was really basing my whole composition the the structure of my technical thing was based on giving me the hydra and then the name of my layer in was everything was based on from the live lab so then and that thing never came so i was like wow that was the base from there i would start building things up uh so but then instead of panicking then yeah i guess is is not different than dancing and i didn't thought about it like dance because then i have the my knowledge is spreading different softwares and i was talking with the guy a tough touch designer my knowledge i know a different topics then of course for instance like i could do these things all of this in one thing in touch designer i could do it but because my knowledge is still isn't is like intermedium level then i still and for me the most important thing is more the content that i'm producing at that moment then i just do in between i don't care the last installation that i was doing then i have to use dmx lights and then mad mapper bdmx hydra smoke machines and and all these elements that you can put all this together in just one thing but then it means that you have to go there and you spend the time with it with it um and i didn't thought until you said that that my doing let's say my mouse my my windows doing this kind of thing um it's it's very is this is it's a different curatorial process of the ima of the composition of what is my screen gonna look like yeah didn't thought of that yeah um yeah this is not something i'm like i always think about when it when i watch your video actually and it's it's never really never say something like that like never said you never said it yeah it's good that we have like two different recordings because it's like it's not just sound but uh yeah basically we have two different experiences and like when we do it remotely and yesterday it was but yeah yesterday it was really the well maybe because we were not using live lab but it was something that we kind of we really shared the experience right it's not something that two things happened separately um right yeah i don't know if it's a good thing or bad thing but now we have experienced two different things so we can have reference yes yeah i agree with you i don't know if it's good or bad thing but just we have it in the back now we have experience in the back and as well to share the space um yeah because i mean at the end and that was the whole point we are doing basically is we're trying to pro propose softness and spaces of communion basically and that's come from the body you know like from the human and we have the we had the experience to being here for all for one week with a stranger that just you met like through internet and then just go and then share an intimate space and i'm talking from more room from our flat and and that's i i think uh in a way that's what we do but that's what we do in the practice anyway we're trying to share in any intimate spaces you know so this experience is in the back you know and so it's super maybe we can do like uh uh and i would like to thank anyway like uh you for inviting me through yan and node to the festival it has been a great experience to be here and yeah that was the credits for the festival yeah i think it's really like um i don't know if i mentioned but it's it's it was really good that it happened in this festival and uh because yeah it feels really like a safe space where we can yeah okay uh i'll stop recording here yeah we can't grow up here", "YZfMBoFWFZY": "no why is it then yeah uh can you hear me hello hello can you hear me no no that's weird oh but uh that's strange i should be speaking right now huh that's weird strange um [Music] that's strange hmm so no it should be working it's only it's it should be working do you hear uh hmm dude [Music] let's see [Music] okay i connected to the different uh microphone how is it okay so yeah that that's another thing i'm just gonna open my camera so then we can [Music] start whatever okay yep yep experience right so yeah i mean i i don't know like it's it's hard like to where to start with but i guess yeah i guess i just don't have to think about who's listening so i'll just just say whatever like we do regularly it was great um now i can say it was great i was so stressful because it was happening in this space in hubs and you know well one thing like there are actually two things that were stressful like one thing was that we are for the first time like oh made it open to public so people we know were there uh wait is it still connected i'm not sure because your video is off oh no uh can you hear me oh no wow okay uh let's see let's see can you hear me now again okay i'm sorry i think the connection is not so good here and it dropped uh i'm putting my image on the stage and oh uh in nexus next hall but i i connected to other network i mean in my mobile and that should work fine so yeah all right so yeah so i just start with from the beginning um what happened yesterday yeah so i i was stressed stressed because of two reasons one was that um it was public for the first time because we when we do practice it's always visual recording and it the video becomes public later and the other thing is that we were performing well practicing in this space this hubs and that just added more complexity to it so like for the first like half an hour i was just this was just panic and but i think the the moment when i started to see people leaving that was that was a great moment for me that i can yeah like it's like just liberating you know i can do whatever i want because i don't have to think about people watching it which is kind of ironic but i think it's it's kind of the it's kind of the you know one of the main questions of this practice i think that it's not like about showing something but it's about something for us sure um one of the reasons that became so messy is because we have less control it just becomes uh yeah it becomes a lot you know and uh but yeah i think it's uh the way it was received was though i think we both but i think in our discipline i feel like uh on my facebook because what i felt is that we both were energetically wise the same like the first time was frustration because things are not working normally we work with this live lab so based on live lab actually this is the first time that we actually didn't use the image of the other person right for the first time live love is something that allows us to share our streams and then we will send uh with some composition and then we do this feedback loop back and forward constantly and the english is happen and then we mix with the most of the movement and that's basically what is what it happened though but then yesterday a live lab was not working the first time and then we were both like okay it's not working and it was like it was the time where people were seeing that and as you said normally there is we don't do it live streaming but we share it afterwards but at that moment there was people in the room and then as yes you said because they can be physical then you can see the avalanche of the name and then you get more i was more nervous when i see some names uh yeah yeah but to be honest like i have to um like i mainly agree but at the same time i think uh one thing i not disagree but uh the reason why i didn't use live lab but was that i didn't even try it because i knew that it's not going to work like it's already so many tabs and because one thing was that i wanted to split the task on like two computers and one of them is already damaged and for some reason it stopped uh reading usb devices that was really weird so that computer became unusable that's why i decided to use just one computer and then because we have this constraint that we use this uh hubs so if i have to choose using hubs or live lab then i think the option is to use hubs well actually retrospectively i could have just used live lab and show my image into your screen so that i can participate in hubs but but i i think no that's that's really risky because i don't have any control because if your stream is gone then everything's gone so i had to put i don't know right so i had to it's true it's like blind and actually this is something like i did once like when i did um live performance in may that was so hard because i don't see what audience our members are saying and i was just streaming to obs uh streamer so i was just doing something in front of the computer without any interaction so i'm just like putting myself here but don't know what's happening like except that i have my phone which has the you know the group with the organizers and so if there is something wrong they can just text me but otherwise i have to just trust them and just do it till the end which wasn't really comfortable to be honest um yeah so this was a constraint and i just decided okay no live lab because also like i'm kind of comfortable with you know if i don't have the your camera feed and i'm just working with my camera feed that's also okay because i'm quite used to hydra for the light coating so that was okay but i would say i wasn't really confident using no sound because i also decided not to use sound because that was already too much for my computer and that's why i at one point i think i i told you you know just played some music because i just felt like we needed something oh now i cannot hear you i think you just changed the audio interface somehow because you're using a microphone so i guess while you're trying i can just continue on my reflection so yeah i think again like going back to the the first thing i said like there were two things that made it really different different from our usual practice um but i think it's good uh especially for like showing to people this thing is perhaps something like it's really good that we did it because always we are doing it's close to two of us and no one can really watch it live although the recordings are public on youtube this was really important for us to show it to someone because we if we continue to work with um just the just like two of us then it becomes like too comfortable and we find maybe we go into flow easily but then that could be one practice but i don't know if it's um something we can like i feel like we have to sometimes put ourselves in a uncomfortable situation to make make it interesting in some ways and yeah jorge is coming back um i just continue but putting something yeah like uncomfortable or even like to me it's like vulnerable because it's like it was not nothing was guaranteed for this performance or practice and yes yes working so yeah i'm just saying that uh it's it's really you know sometimes for me it's important to put myself in uncomfortable or like even like vulnerable situation to show something yeah i mean yeah and at the same time to me like it's also important not to say i after the practice i thought like okay maybe we could have wrote written like it was it is a open studio or open lab that you know it's not not like uh like it's like a sharing rather than presentation but i'm also not sure about that because it's it sounds a bit like an excuse that you know we're not doing anything um spectacular but we're just like trying things which is okay but i i and i like that idea but also i feel that it becomes it feels like it becomes like excuse in a negative way well i mean the one the first thing that i would like to say is that um i [Music] i mean we have been discussing these topics like the whole week in the festival this festival has been a great uh opportunity to share with different people that works a lot with uh yeah i mean a lot of cool stuff i mean people who can make big projects they can do very impressive technical things right and then then we have discussion sometimes and then uh we have been repeating somehow that this idea of um that it's important to be vulnerable uh in order to i mean i think it's important one hand to be vulnerable as you said uh but at the same at the same time uh that's what i was reflecting from the performance yesterday that is and it comes from the from this practice that i was doing in the morning and it was somebody who was saying that i feel that then is then my responsibility then to be uncomfortable uh in the name of uh someone who cannot have a voice so if because i believe that what we do is actually opening spaces for other people for other practices to happen for other things to exist not necessarily connected uh with productivity and we portrayed an imperialist economy and a capitalistic system um so then because i believe that what we do is opening spaces um then i from the from the experience of showing to people yesterday it was so uncomfortable like then i was said that i can like i feel responsible because i propose nobody's nobody's forcing me to do this but i feel responsible that i can be out of my comfort zone the one that we create when we start evolving every week the practice that we have that is the base the real base where we actually we develop choreographic elements uh digital and graphical elements and a part of that with what we talk in terms of political content and that's the base but because we have that comfort that we have i think that i feel this is my responsibility when i speak as a person as a unity then i will i feel my responsibility to be uncomfortable i can be uncomfortable in a space like that in a performative state even though when the format is not about performing then i i believe that i mean i from the experience i can say like yeah this is good because actually we failed i mean we felt in terms of like uh yeah we failed in a way and but then we fail in a safe space and and that's that's good yeah yeah i think i totally agree with that like failed in a safe space and it was also like it's not yeah it's not something that we were asked to do the performance or practice but we proposed it and it's i don't know like but this is like also like kind of to me it was weird situation because i think it was clear like like it was clearer if it's something that someone asked us to do a performance in some kind of you know festival or conference then then i would think that okay we have to do something more something that we feel more comfortable or even just you know use a um recorded version or something because it's then it becomes you know yeah suddenly we were like responsible for like so many things to be you know part of the festival and this audience and yeah um but for us it was something that it was like half official because it was in the program of the festival and but at the same time it's something we proposed and with that yeah with that it was fine and i think well i think if you're in a for example like um practicing dance maybe there's like places where you can show something like this you know like that it's like it can be work in progress or it's something that is not like like uh you're not sure if it really works fine or not but in digital art i think it's way like these opportunities are way less than in dance what do you mean like to like where you can fail actually like you know i feel in digital art it feels i mean because it's also like with this weird tension that for example in like visual art like in a sense of you know um more like classical context where people you know show things in a gallery sculpture or painting or something in between or whatever it's you know it's technically it's hard to fail like well if you have something like mechanical or something with projection you might be it's possible to you know technically fail but there is something that that can be shown and but but for digital art media art it's if if it's not functional then it's it's it's not a artwork because you know they have to put the sign that uh it's under you know maintenance or something and suddenly it becomes just an object another another piece so that's why i feel we have this kind of like kind of we have to yeah like make it perfect like perfectionism in this field that it has to work otherwise you yeah it's not a work you cannot fail in a sense i mean i felt like i was gonna repeat something that i just said because i some time ago i did my microphone with me so uh because it's part of the same thing that we are talking so again because the format that we propose is uh in a way that doesn't have a goal uh it's just what we propose is the practice then the we encounter ourselves ourselves with a failure in terms of like it was not so cool as we expected somehow because already there's some expectation that we had and we even have some mistakes this time with this and we make the put the we'd have a tech rehearsal where things are working and they were working super good uh and then then yeah so again so what i was trying to say is that um that it's important to be uh uncomfortable for a little bit i mean that i can feel myself that i can be uncomfortable in in let's say that was the space the performance and i can be in that uncomfortable for a little bit if i believe that that's giving so much space for other things to happen and in this case it's just because i believe that what we do is just opening the spaces where things don't have to be binary the sense of like one thing is the things are just one thing or the other thing so just opening spaces as such and then connected what you were saying is that um the the way i see it is in terms of technology when you work with the digital art or art classical art visual arts or dance but i think it makes it more harsh with the limits in terms of working of not working is because one is like its technological based so that's one constraint that you will have and the system is binary anyway so let's say in terms of like electricity it will if the let's say if we are based our performances with a computer there is plug to the socket if at that moment the electricity is gone everything is gone because that's the nature of the electricity um but and then in relation to and that is portrayed uh and because of that so the aim is very specific and then the system uh allows or let's say i will think that something is good or productive only when it's not failing and and is making money basically uh yeah so yeah again so basically there are these two ideas no this one one about the this idea the new media technology is uh because the nature of itself comes from design and engineering it has this binary approach uh of of prestigious binary constraints in terms of electricity that in a way i see that is portrayed and uh or is being monetized in the system meaning that you will get more money as more things you can make more impressive and then but then in the other side that's where we are more it's like we work towards something that we tried we said and we have been talking in this conference with not only us but uh allah for instance that she's the one who's closing the festival tomorrow and part of the her proposition is about the same is uh about the critique of the system itself to her performance so and then so then we are in in the space i believe there is so yeah the the opening spaces in between the because we are not contemporanes we are not art we work with uh technical elements we work with them but we cannot accept is not binary because we are there and but at the same time we are completely at the other extremes so we are in between somehow because we use dance main contemporary dance elements and then we try to evolve this the these concepts through discussions and then the technological part but then so it's not one thing or the other one it's just something in between and then just we tried to it became it started as a joke no it was for us best practices no from best practices coming from this idea best practices in coding so then best practices in contemporary dance you know as an inside joke and then we are just yeah yeah well i wanted to ask you something sure okay so what do you think it was itself what do you mean sorry i couldn't hear positive aspect of what maybe let me try to explain my uh ask you to uh myself with an explanation like one of the things that i could enjoy that i could not have done if i because now for me we are we are in the same space so we are even though now we are in different phases in the building because otherwise we're in the same computer uh but we are in the same space physically and it was the first time that we were trying this after six months and then what i was trying to uh ask you was more in relation to uh what was positive of of the physical encounter i see something positive yeah um that's a good question and actually like i think this is kind of uh like one of the biggest questions because we have been working remotely together and then suddenly we came um like we met for the first time and then we did this practice together and physically in the same space so i know that this is like a big question but to me like i think it's interesting that i didn't really care it didn't really like it wasn't a question for me like i did it was not strange it was not comfortable but it was but i wouldn't say it was natural because it's not natural um but it in a way it didn't bother me the fact that you were there and well the first time it then in the first rehearsal that we have it was very strong you know you said that that time right right so that one i [Music] didn't want to like feel your presence so i had to like put my headphones on and listen to music um [Music] that's right yeah so that was like really like i was feeling that a lot but yesterday it was like for me it was fine like that you were there because i think i was just too overwhelmed by other things other factors that was you know [Music] i had to take care of so i didn't really think that i didn't really care that you were there like i like we had to like we had really like you know short amount of time to set it up in the because it's a workshop room and workshop was happening you know half an hour before we start started so we were just like just putting everything there and just start because it was you know we have to start it on time because that's part of our practice and then i noticed that i forgot to put the green screen and so like it was like you know that kind of mindset like i was just like it's it was not you know like i i left the room at some point i thought you went to the room to take the the the green t-shirt no so so um when i went there it was actually because i um oh yeah because the network was really slow on the wi-fi and i thought okay i have to get i have to connect to my phone for the network like mobile network and that's why i i went back because i know that i knew that i forgot the cable in the room because i thought that it's something i don't need for the practice but it was actually needed yeah yeah okay yeah so for it i mean yeah go ahead it was that because yeah so if i see a respective in retrospective what happened is like first 20 minutes was like oh my god what is this happening so i'm sure like when we see the recording like it just was really really up at the point of like crying you know like very dramatic like oh my god this is horrible yeah and then slowly i start feeling okay this is what it is and then so i said okay i take care of myself and then i will just start doing things from that and then it's slowly then then for some reason then we start i start feeling ah because then the computer the ghost computer was there the computer then was recording the physical space at the same time and then we have that interaction through that space while it's still some so then we were dancing as well and then we were projecting towards there so uh so it was something that happened there i mean there's so much things in between because it's like we are doing the thing in our screen right and then but we cannot share that stream so like say normally what it happens is that we do this just with strings and then we do as i plan before but then at that moment we could not because live lab was not working then we were doing our stuff but then at the same time there was the ghost computer the one in between these two and that one was capturing with a wide angle camera the physical space and then we start sometimes dancing there uh and then sometimes and becomes became slowly slowly uh it was gradually growing until the moment that we were uh i think yeah i think at some point we break the digital and the physical space and i'm not consciously and we were just dancing so it's slowly how i see it is like okay so disaster i'm alone then it slowly started interacting because the other camera was there then i see you and these things and then things were from that point they were slowly gradually uh growing up in the in somehow in some in in indirect interaction and then until just we end up going for the dancing and then going really for the dancing then the two physical space complete completely at some point then we when we cross the spaces you end up in my screen i end up in your screen and we were just dancing and going for the flow which was i think the last five minutes at that moment and we never planned something like that i mean that was not part of the game because that's something that we cannot do it just happened at that moment i think it was more like a i feel like a moment of relief like oh my god let's do something and then just go for it and it was it was an euphoric moment for me yeah i don't know well i have i have to say that it's it's definitely something i like it was like my intention like i didn't plan anything like that but um as we start it was like it was just horrible experience at first and then then as soon as because i think the thing was that if there are people from the beginning then i feel that okay i have to do something to the people because they're here for you know watching something um and so i it it has to be you know this has to really start from the the start and but that's then if you think about like this our practice like regular ones it's nothing like that we just like slowly build up and um even if we just do it you know uh by ourselves it's it takes so long to build up things and maybe there are some like interesting moments happening after 20 minutes or after 30 minutes but usually the you know there's this climax at the last five or ten minutes and i totally forgot about that fact like i was thinking that yesterday like i have to really like go with the you know maximum energy from the beginning but that's not possible just you know like so then i then people start to leave and then i was like okay yeah it's true like i can just you know start to like rather think about you know what not what i can do right now but what's gonna happen at the end and then i saw that that computer that was you know in between that you you named it ghost computer that was in between and we're not supposed to touch it i mean that was not our intention but um i thought okay yeah i saw that that computer was like you know the the hubs was crashed because of something i don't know probably the network and i was like okay i just open it again but then what if i use hydra on this computer instead of just sharing the video camera because of the webcam because you know we could use that and and actually that computer was uh much more powerful than mine so i was like okay i can just you know start doing things with this and that's where it start to you know like things start to blend i'm sorry to interrupt i think just now because you were speaking about that i didn't thought of that that's a conscious compositional decision that you took there that's that's a choreographer i mean that's a on the spot so this is happening and then you took the choreographic decision of okay we need that could be happening and then you did it yeah i mean because i was for me just as i expressed before i just gradually entering the flow i just at some point i saw that thing was green but you know i didn't but it yeah it was not reflecting that you did it consciously it was conscious conscious decision and i mean of course like again it's not something planned in advance but because it was crashed crashed and i have to you know reopen things but then you know what if i just do it um yeah do it with hydra so i can start coding with it and then i then it becomes really became really interesting for me because i can use two computers here and there and then go there to change something and come back to change something um i have to admit that the filter i mean the effect was a bit too bit too similar between them but still it was quite interesting that i for me it was really interesting that it the coding really became physical because it's not that i'm just coding here but i can go to the other computed code and then come back to code which was something the feeling that i never had before because ow because before but because normally when you use the other computer that you have you don't cope with that you use it as a secondary something i don't want to touch it it's just for recording i just start recording and that's it right that's that's the purpose of the second computer but uh yeah this time it was very different and i think it's also helps like if i have one desk where every all the equipment is here then probably it's a different experience you know i'm because i don't have to move from here to use different computers or different equipment but it was physically there and i have to come back go back and forth and also also that was you were forced to you physically were forced to move in that direction and because of that you have it i mean you have to see me because you have to keep on doing that for the maintaining of the computer the second one that you were using yeah and also it also corresponds to the physical uh not the virtual composition inside hubs that was really interesting yeah yeah yeah okay now i see what you mean with that no yeah if if you will not mention then i wouldn't think of that and i i even thought like maybe i can write code in your computer which i don't think i did you should try like you you could have tried but i mean this is this is cool i mean that the they just that we have the first experience and as i said like this is an uncomfort space i mean this is a safe space where we could fail and we can try things and so then we could be uncomfortable for a little bit meaning that we can be in the position of oh my god there are people coming and seeing us uh i am okay with for being like that well for for me maybe if it's a bit less stressful that will be great because i think because of this organizing unconferences that that's just too much for me but uh yeah uh but but i i agree with what you mean yeah maybe at some point we could try something in the hops uh we could see like something from time to time you know even once every month something like that and we will actually what i found is cooling that is that that integrate but that's completely in no direction uh but it integrates the idea of curatorial processes in digital dance basically because then if we use this space for instance then it means that we have to think where the things are going to have be and that's a complete that's a that's another thing um yeah yeah i see but actually that's really no no that's actually interesting and that's something i even see in the regular practice because you do the screen recording like the whole screen recording right and when i see your recording i see that you're like moving things around like going to another desktop and you know moving window here and there and i try not to do that in my recording i try to you know make it more stable that i have this hydra window and maybe tidal cycles here and i just you know try to stick to this composition but this could be also it's a bit like in between stage design and choreography that you can you know play with the arrangement with the windows yeah okay now i see what i mean yeah like yesterday for reason like i did it consciously like normally as you said i will record like i will share my old whole screen but then then yesterday i thought i would just do hydra to just have a stable just one image there but uh yeah i like it because i don't have it consciously or unconsciously it's just there is so much motion now so i think it makes things not easy for myself because then i have sometimes yeah i have the dmx and hydra then sometimes i try to put because because my my knowledge of hydra since i haven't spent so much time is limiting some things that i can do like some of the days before i was thinking like maybe i should do something and then i thought no actually i know fewer a few elements actually i can count maybe with my one hand but then from those if i combine even tabs together they're gonna have two stuff um because i just create reverberations or then i use different directions or speeds colors things like this and cameras and other windows and with that already it's a lot so then uh what i yeah but that means that i have i need to have like if i want to do these kind of things i need to have at least two or three hydras and then a part of that i use bdmx and as you know vdmx is basically full of windows so every time that i just do like this and then just this all these small windows just pop up and sometimes i have like to be more than 20 30 small windows all around yeah and and it's what i'm trying to say is in relation to i didn't thought about at all just until now you said because then you are talking about curricular processes that is so true that like now i have experience because we have been doing this for many months already and then i don't get so stressed and it's so similar i hope what will happen to me when i'm improvising dancing literally if i already have been improvising with certain elements for a few months i will be panicking the first time but then after a few months i will be okay even though i'm lost and that's what happened yesterday like when when i didn't i was really basing my whole composition the the structure of my technical thing was based on give me the hydra and then the name of my layer in was everything was based on height from the live lab so then and that thing never came so i was like wow that was the base from there i would start building things up uh so but then instead of panicking then yeah i guess is is not different than dancing and i didn't thought about it like dance because then i have my knowledge is spreading different softwares and i was talking with the guy on top she's a touch designer my knowledge i know a different topic then of course for instance like i could do these things all of this in one thing in coach designer i could do it but because my knowledge is still isn't is like intermedium level then i still and for me the most important thing is more the content that i'm producing at that moment then i just do in between i don't care the last installation that i was doing then i have to use dmx lights and then mad mapper bdmx hydra smoke machines uh and and all these elements that you can put all things together in just one thing but then it means that you have to go there and spend the time with it with it um and i didn't thought until you said that that my doing let's say my mouse my my windows doing this kind of thing uh it's it's very it's a it's a different curatorial process of the of the composition of what is my string gonna look like yeah you didn't thought of that yeah um yeah this is not something i'm like i always think about when it when i watch your video actually and it's it's always really nice to have to that yeah it's good that we have like two different recordings because it's like it's not just sound but uh yeah basically we have two different experiences and like when we do it remotely and yesterday it was but yeah yesterday it was really the well maybe because we were not using live lab but it was something that we kind of we really shared the experience right it's not something that two things happened separately um right yeah i don't know if it's a good thing or bad thing but now we have experienced two different things so we can have reference to it yeah yeah i agree with you i don't know if it's good or bad thing but just we have it in the back now we have experience in the back and i'm going to share the space and yeah because i mean at the end and that was the whole point we are doing basically is we're trying to propose softness and spaces of communion basically and that's come from the body you know like from the human and we have the we have the experience of being here for for one week with a stranger that just you met like through internet and then just go and then share an interesting space and i'm talking from more rooms and and that's i i think in a way that's what we do but that's what we do in the practice anyway we're trying to share in any intimate spaces yeah so this experience is in the back i would like to thank anyway like uh you for inviting me through yan and node to the festival it has been a great experience to be here and yeah that was the credits for the festival yeah i i think it's really like um i don't know if i mentioned but it's it's it was really good that it happened in this festival and uh because yeah it feels really like a safe space where we can fail i can't be saying this yeah if it was like too formal then it would have been just like you know yeah okay uh i'll stop the recording here because i'm getting tired", "0-YILmKxVhY": "[Music] uh or if you want i can also align your video on the stage if you want yeah just put it in a place there there is yeah just one thing is easier because you're used to yeah virtually space virtual space that's where we live yes that's what we are i think i'm on top [Music] but i have to say for the last launch we have to use um gst because this becomes being really needed to do it on hubs uh yeah are you which which side are you facing uh from this way right yeah just put your image close yeah i'm just gonna be holding [Music] like i mean how do i go with flying mode like with the avatar i will let you know later okay okay let's just put ourselves oh no you're really big and i will be big as well just to be [Music] consistent [Music] yeah that's important that's the theme well not the theme but something i'll paint myself and then i open you as well you are pinned so we should be ready i will because this is such a thing this is not best practice this is this is yeah like we do it this way today and next time we can choose if we do it in hubs or jc or something because this might be a lot of work but let's see well yeah yeah okay okay but i was thinking i was about to say like we talked about later we are i mean this is the place we have been saying this since friday that we meet we are saying we talk about later because we were trying to save information about the practice for the conversation right but now we are in the conversation sorry what does it mean that we the whole time we have been when we are talking about something yes but now is the moment that so i it was just a reflect i was trying to tell you something about the practice and i said like we can talk about later and then i mean this is the space for talking of that yeah so i don't know if there is just a given a bit of introduction actually because we just like usually how we do it is just a chat so we just talk but i think because there are actually well seven users which means i have two users myself and jorge has one so four people are here who are who might be listening or not um okay and like we never like give like proper introductions but naoto and his uh jorge and we yeah we just do um best practices in contemporary dance that's the session we're doing every week and we have this kind of special edition or node forum inside hubs which we usually do it in zoom or live lab live lab is something similar to zoom but open source for performing performing arts let's say and uh yeah and it's just like casual conversation so we just start keep talking and if any of you have questions just just write in the bottom bar or you can just interrupt us and ask questions or give comments that would be great and you have to you should come too close to the stage to hear better hear that yeah yeah yeah it's so if you miss it you can still watch on youtube later so yeah so you said yeah so i don't know i i shouldn't so i think that the point is that we don't really keep it like formal so like as a i'm kind of used to like being like a facilitator in this event so i have to be like oh okay so i have to tell everything about what i'm doing and why we're saying this but i guess we just like skip this because i want to keep it easy um yeah so like right we have been saying that like we keep important topics conversation for this chat because when we just talk in real life it's not like recorded which is funny i think a lot will jesus start talking about i think that when first i think i have to say that when i was going up taking the elevator after i have the launch i thought oh my god i feel a bit nervous if i will be performing which is and then on the on the way i was thinking oh my god this feeling of performance nerves like that's the kind of thing that i refuse from dance and that's why i'm not dancing on stage anymore and and because we are in the festival and then now we are here in the stage uh then it's it felt you know the pressure of of doing something i think of doing something because what what it frees me and that's what i love to spend the time with you and the practices and the best practices is because it frees is actually empty space in my head um because there is no that there is not really a goal in what we do so it just give me actually more space more air in that sense because i feel it now in my stomach i feel that i have less air then if i will do it at um at home just you and me talking now yeah yeah yeah uh sorry like obviously i was uh checking some messages because i i spoke pc i think that's the whole point you know like we're in the festival and no matter what we do it's part of the festival like but like you know even if we just go to the kiosk and get drink that's part of the festival and you know um yeah so that already gives different feeling and it's funny like when i was saying yesterday like it feels more like a residency and yeah i started to think like what is what's the residency feeling i don't know like probably like you have more experience with like going joining like residencies but for me like i think the biggest one i had was like longest one was like three months in korea and that was like definitely like you know like this feeling of meeting new people for like first few weeks and then just you know having weird friendship and you know weird rhythm because we're like kind of living together and you know like but not necessarily doing something together but we have some interesting conversations um that is not recorded um yeah but this one was like like because i think everyone was like kind of similar age and um last year when i had like one month residency in hong kong was a bit more different because like um there was no like fellow artists but like i was with um rafael he's uh who who uh his friend of neil and we were doing this pathfinder thing i'm not saying i'm not trying to you know collect this node but um because he's older than me and he's more experienced so it's uh what do you mean what sorry about what do you mean with more experience like experience in dance or experience experiencing what i mean but experience you know in like life basically like dance of course but also like like life in general because you know like during residency is it's not about like artistic practice but it's more about life i think i never thought about it but i just came up with that i don't know yeah i see what i mean so i don't know why i started talking about this but um but it's i mean i think you start thinking about this because we are mentioned somehow that we are in a festival so yeah something somehow you were you connected like that because i mean what i was just trying to say i didn't want to sound that is negative i'm super uh happy um uh to be here um and share the time with so different people um it's just a reflection when i was just going up because just feeling in my body yeah my stomach i have less air in the left side i could i could feel it um and then it's just a reflection of wow okay now maybe there is somebody um yeah yeah yeah and now like i'm just like taking a photo because i now i was like okay i have to put it on the twitter to advertise and blah blah and um sorry uh again it becomes you know the whole thing with the festival and but i think it's interesting to think about like just relating us to like other spaces other people other organizations because we can keep this you know best practices as like you know really personal thing and just do it um in our like not saying the bubble but it's a bit like you know kind of this idea that you have your atlea in in a forest or something and you don't have like interaction with people that you just like create your own work and whatever you create is good for you then it's good and i think that's kind of beautiful and but also like you know we live in the society more or less we like it or not and i mean from a different point of view from from that because i feel that what we do there is because there is an experience that we are trying to dare just practices that we are trying when we basically are trying to um try to somehow i see is that we're trying to decolonize somehow the knowledge in terms of like binary the way how how structures are in a way we are trying to not be in a structure right so we are trying to not articulate the language in a way we you're trying to not use internal i mean that's what i mean with the colonialized the knowledge in the sense of article you need to in order to articulate something you need to use the language and the language is being imposed because i think is if we are doing something then somehow i feel it can bring some comfort or some relation to other people who somehow relate to what we do then i feel a i want to share it with people so then it's so there are two different things one is like me as jorge as myself like how i can then have to manage myself to then let's say do uh um what is what is the word that i'm doing um yeah and i don't know maybe i get i get lost in what i was saying i mean what i was trying to say just because you said that maybe because we were reflecting about the festival you said that maybe we should keep a more like more close but anyway we that's what we do and i think that's beautiful we will keep on doing that because it's not refreshing i think when we have the chances to be out like here i feel it's more like as a responsibility for me to put myself together and then just do a bit of effort you know i was thinking already like next week i'm not gonna have i don't want to have best practices you know like but then the week after for sure do you remember when i was in puf because i have some deadlines i couldn't attending one thing and i remember that i really miss it when when i met you back in brussels then i thought this is good that's really good so i don't know how you see this but i'm trying to answer them what you said the way i see it is like if i go i i want to share the message basically basically because there is no articulation in such as right um yeah i don't know if i'm kind of replying to this or not but um like what i really like what i do is like of course there's there's this kind of self satisfaction in you know this practice but also like i have always not the message but like i think always i want to tell something to not necessarily people that like kind of specific people specific population and i don't necessarily like try to reach as many as possible but it's more about like if like if there's like 100 people in the audience and if i talk about something i don't really think about like convincing like 99 people out of 100 but it's like if one or two people in the audience get something like get ins actually inspired uh that maybe that's too much but it gets something from what i say or what i do that's something i'm aiming for and especially like in this kind of festival like it's always really difficult that um like things are really framed and like talks are like they try to you know like raise questions but it's kind of expected questions you know in a way that um yeah like they have their own frame and theme and um it's it's not about like sharing something actually this is something i talk with jorge uh while we're recording but uh i what i do is really raw and it's not like uh we're sharing the results or we're not like um performing but it's actually we are showing the process and we in the sense that we are really um i would say vulnerable because we we cannot protect ourselves yeah i i subscribe with this idea that you said of vulnerability because for that coming from my background and specifically the way i study dance then i study i think in a really classical way i think now contemporary dance is not like that but then i i think i have my own like my own issues and traumas between that frame of you the dancer you like being that thing because it's more like an at that body that is all the the charge that it has been a stage projection all these kind of things so that i that it has been for me a process uh and that's including path the performing arts forum uh there is another resident that i'm co-owner and where this the process they try to be horizontal and at the same time the idea of softness yeah they put it more as softness than vulnerability um but i subscribe to your idea of vulnerability um yeah yeah i described it's funny like we never like kind of talked about this kind of direction but like i think softness is more like carrying someone is really like important and at the same time like sometimes it's just like so effective to show how vulnerable you are like it's not necessarily like coming out something that it's but yeah like because you know i am sorry about this uh i'm in the office so i'm really not just annoyed but i'm just distracted by this but um uh what i want to say is uh like for example i talk about neurodiversity and this is just like something that i have to say that you know i'm uh i'm really uncomfortable with how the world is and i just have to say it even though i'm really like not um yeah like comfortable to say that but it's just putting out that like this and say how um vulnerable i am is just like the best way to to address and and especially it's like so interesting that like so many people well so many people ask me like how is it to be autistic and is that like do you have that inconvenience being so and i was like of course like so many things like i have to like you know tolerate like i cannot tolerate but i have to live with it but um why i'm saying this uh i don't know but i think uh kind of going back to the best practice that we're trying to do i think it's also interesting to say like how it is to do something raw like not as a performance but what is it to practice maybe maybe but maybe what we can say as well is a little bit of what is it like basically what we do is then we we try to frame uh movement and digital uh visual generatives something i guess what we do is like we have a meeting like this one that we're having right now and then i would create a composition based on a lots of green key and then different softwares uh or programming languages and then i will send that image to now so now to do something with it maybe he will send it back to me and then create this feedback loop sometimes or not but basically the idea is between that uh correct me if i'm wrong the then just we mix between we move from real space so if i start moving here and then i create a composition then i do something with it i send it to now to now we'll do something with it sometimes he will send it back we create feedback loops and then we have this relation basically between the body and and and the meeting their beautiful meeting right yeah um yeah i i don't know what to i i'm sorry i've been lost but um yeah like we always say like this is like practice but at the same time like this is so um like we are we're really advanced in a way like we never like noticed but um like if like for example like yesterday i had a chance to talk about like what i'm doing at the hydra meetup yeah like what i've been doing and like it really like feels like oh wow like people are like really interested in what we're doing and it's something like not just we're playing with the toys but we actually have something to share and um and also it's not like you know it is really something uh not polished yet but it's it's complicated but i i think that's the power i mean i think that the the or i like to subscribe to that idea of the so two things that i want to say one is like i i i i completely i understand what you said in the sense that basically is because we are what we do is like we keep practicing so anything i think that you will do in life and we have been practicing for six months already so we practice every week for one hour and sometimes even more and we talk before and after so basically we have been rehearsing since six months non-stop every week so so the craft that we are just a framework it already start having some uh more shape i guess and then then when we start talking about now what are the constraints that we want to talk about what are conceptually the things that we want to evolve and all the topics that the slowly we start introducing when we have this discussion and i think that that's why it makes it so relevant to have this discussion for us who are here to know is that we need to have the discussion because since what we do when we meet to perform let's say to do the best practices at that moment we don't talk uh or sometimes i go i i gonna ask out to something that i cannot solve and that's part of the practice as well you know all these kind of things that happen in between but we need to have the space of talking after or before because the since the framework is not defined just we do it we do we do we do but there's so much happening in my body in my brain in my doing with my feeling that i need i want to share with now to try i want to try to understand and i want to just basically share i guess i just want to share with the other person and see what is he uh and that's why so relevant for us having his discussion do you think it's like well i think the sharing is one thing but i think it's also important for us to like reflect on what we're doing and also have archive of what we've been doing yeah well i mean the way how i see it is as i said because we are two different persons and then like my approaching to the doing is and that's why i try to introduce i'm trying to develop it slowly uh a speech so meaning that conceptually i need to start defining what is what it means all this abstraction means more or less this word and then from there the next word and then from there the next board in order to start making something uh more shareable in terms of language let's say like uh yeah language english let's say this is really interesting because like it's something that like you kind of make the not theory but more like understanding things in systematic way but that also might exclude some people because they have to like learn what we're talking about if we develop our own language but you mean in the respect literally of the practicing or in the on the con because i in a way i start seeing the best practices everything the everything that we do but like either let's say the performative state if we want to go to this idea of like judith butler that was trying to this this performative state uh that is like the best practices that we have from nine to ten every week um where we don't talk and just we do and then this is basically a lot of glitches and crazy dancing and uh and pop songs and rihanna and all these things in between and then and the other state would be trying to be serious or will we try just to actually just yeah but what we try to do is articulate what that that is happening there right yeah so yeah yeah i don't know if that was what you were asking but what did you you said can you repeat what did you ask for what did you ask well in a way that we become like uh kind of too specialized for example about best practices and contemporary dance and our idea is to share it but at the same time it might be you know not being at our own bubble but becoming a bit more like uh yeah exclusive wow i mean i hope it's not because one of the reasons that i like do the things that i do in my life right now is because i unsubscribed from cla from the stuff that are contemporary dance in belgium the place where i'm coming from because the state of the art of contemporary dance is self-referential as in any other state-of-the-art field they you need people to push those fields meaning that i understood at some point that that's something that i don't want to do that doesn't mean what i do is i'm not because i don't i'm not interested in the hierarchical or in the binary thinking i just understand that there's then the let's say the field that i'm coming from most of my friends they work in that field they are in the in in the ground they are in the in that field but my i i understood and i like to believe that what i do is try to uh not be self-referential uh in that sense yeah so yeah so yeah so that's what i was saying that i hope that we are not getting that uh that we don't get yeah yeah i don't know what to say i just hope there is not like that right no as i say like i i start to be yeah i get confused because like it's kind of two conflicting things but i think what's important to think about is that we don't have anything like uh something um theoretical or conception or yeah i can even say conceptual in this uh well not contemporary dance but in like working with dance and technology it's always you know cool people from dance and cool people from technology come and they just do something but there's no like you know something that is developed as a as a whole community no no well i think there is one of the places where i see there is relevance for what we do is because um as we mentioned in previous discussions then and that's that's something that is granted or written or talk that is uh then the dance and technology there is at some there's often there is a one is a disservice to the other one so if as a dancer as a choreographer i i want to use technologies basically i'm hired hiring services from technology and but like really a creative process i mean i think the whole and it happens all the way around as well you know like from uh the science to you you can hire a dancer to do just do your dance you you you dance for two minutes we pay you for your service of dancer and then we keep on doing or design things um yeah that's like i don't know why i was dead well i forgot what you said uh yeah like the this kind of uh let's say the theory or the practice like this two parties working together or i i would say like assange is already wrong that you know someone it has to be specialized in dance and not in tech and there's other guy who's specialized in technology and kind of dance like this is already like kind of funny with especially regarding what we do as uh too yeah but i mean the way i see it is like i think i was trying to introduce that in order to say this that because um there is not really clarity in what is the that we do let's say in dance or the visuals as well and we keep on trying to just speak about those constraints and these kind of things um then the space that is creating between is this is that that's the air that i feel in my stomach that's the air that i need to that's the air that i feel like here i can i wish i wish other people could feel that place where you can have some basically even like hope or you know it just it feels like good because there is not a goal and so if we go and the whole thing is just frame because it's inside of a system that is uh it's a capitalistic system so anything it has to have an economical uh it responds to a cut to the economy and the economy is based in the binary and so all these processes become our pragmatics our pragmatics but and yeah like just uh like i think this is something i said to you uh while we're not recording i mean we met in real life was that i think it's really fortunate that we met in the context that we're not like aiming for something like we we're not like i didn't approach you or you didn't approach me to create a specific piece that to be shown at specific you know festival or whatever like for example we're here but it's not like we aim for you know okay let's aim for node and do something for that it's more like you know evolved and then john reached out to me and then it happened like this but it's just a part of it and we're kind of you know still practicing and it's not like a set goal so far um i mean conceptually we kind of start to form what we want in some ways but it's not like you know we have date or premiere or anything and i think that's really like as as an artist i think that's really important to have that kind of practice well i don't know i think it depends on the person but um but let's let's say that like for example if dance tech collaboration happens it's always really uh yeah pragmatic and or like it's something that you have a set goal and you have to yeah like do something within that time very you have concrete outcome and it's not something that you must meet and do something every week and i think something that i would like to add on on top of that is that something that happens now that you see with different people that have a good uh approach to technology uh i mean interesting is that because it comes from a field that is very pragmatic so or engineering or design or let's say problem solving then it's it's it's funny because yeah just it feels that it it's very cold you know it's very cold uh while uh i mean and dance is a is a humanistic feel now it's a it's a humanity feel uh in academia so but then when there is approach of engineering of design that it comes more from this scientific point of view many times it happens as i share with you with this collective that i'm working with it sees these people that work with space and uh this kind of things then because nature of them most of them are or uh they're very they're bioengineering or this kind of uh coming from these kind of fields then they talk about humanity in a third person way way often that's the way who i met them and they cannot recognize that they they're constantly trying to propose a solution and that's something that i see often as well when i see in dance and technology there is like okay we're going to create something for motion tracking but basically there's a lot of proposition for a problem so problem solving so the space so this is then going back to what just we said then the space of softness is not also evident in these spaces because many times it's very costly for the production to give us i mean who's gonna talk about yeah i mean these soft environments in when you have to do these productions right yeah like if you have a production then does it make sense yeah i mean when i work with dancers oh yeah like let's say i work with dancers as a kind of not technician but uh like digital artists let's say i try to be [Music] try to have this kind of not have softness but it's it's i think it's always about like giving some room for um like experiment in terms of like i suggest things and you know try not to like you know one side is like kind of imposing something very concrete um like for example [Music] um but it's a hard like for example like if a dancer it's nothing like a specific story but let's say like dancer wants to do projection but maybe she or he did like they did like a lot of research okay let's say like v4 is like great platforms please let's use before and then i like always i'm kind of the person who questions that as it happened before does it even have to be like video like can it be like video loop or can it be like like i i kind of you know i i call myself lazy person because i try not i try to think about like doing less and less development and try to put more um like energy for this uh artistic part and not to like over over engineer it and sometimes like you know like maybe if something doesn't have to be interactive then or it doesn't have to be generated like real-time visual maybe it can be just a video loop or um yeah like it doesn't have to be tracking but maybe someone behind is like you know moving the cursor and try following the dancer for example which kind of adds something to it i think it really depends on the concept if it's something about like very technical uh thing is like important in the concept then it's probably like kind of cheating but if it's something about the relation of relationship of the the lights in the space and the body then it doesn't necessarily have to be like a proper body tracking i don't know why i said this but i think but something that's uh for me it's really interesting yeah and they asking for these questions like not straight like going from this like for example like motion capture or can we use this specific technology for like heart rate whatever but like my question is always like do we really need it and i think because the dancers sometimes they don't know what they need to use so i'm more like a consultant to propose ways to do it but also like this is like i think i can do it because i have um a little bit of experience in these collaborations and um yeah i i know what what's available as a tool but if this is like for example like if the dancer and they contacted um for example engineer then they would be you know like or even like willing to use more and more technologies in the work and that gets really messy and i i see that that happens often in this kind of collaboration as well i don't know what i mean yeah um maybe i would like to bring something from the notes that we have from the last time um yeah we were talking about this okay this is actually so now we have been almost for 40 minutes this is i mean we have been doing ladies psychological thing it's part of the thing though like this is part of what we do it's just the life itself so we do this but i guess because it just we came into the festival now we have been allowed to doing this uh in that in this reflection but let's get so back to the juice so then uh about intentionality about intentionality and vectors uh so that's part of the thing so that we work and that's an idea that i i mean i kind of i share a bit now to see what he thinks uh because i see it that so i'm performing in my camera so uh my so there's a camera here and then so then i move no then i do what i have to do and even though i'm here not facing the camera because i'm performing then my intention is still there so my attention goes my intention is still will be going it's like if i still would be doing here while i'm here because i know i'm in a video conference with you and so yeah so maybe [Music] can you say something about this idea of intention intentionality oh my god again the dance studio moment can you share your experience in this uh now and also like we kind of not the circle but no i think it's good to like that i said this the dance studio moment because it's i'm not like pointing out this is awkward i just like you know this i don't like this but it's just like kind of started to like this becomes like a language or like the shape that starts to form a shape that you know this kind of question is dance studio kind of moment this kind of question is uh more uh how we do chad but anyways um but it's still still the question is technical yeah yeah no uh yeah i remember the question this time um so the intentionality and the vector and um i don't know i didn't really prepare anything about this question but the funny thing like today i i was uh first half of the lunch was happening in hubs and then we went moved to the jitsi um but when we were in hubs like it was so weird that um we have this dining table over there and uh you don't have to see it now but what happens is like you put this image of yourself like what we have right now and on the stage but actually the avatar is not there like avatar is a bit far from the trenches and yes what you can do is like you have the dining table and you put yourself the video on the other side of the table and you're sitting like facing you and having lunch and this is also like you're facing that and actually this is something that happened this morning when you said we're in the dance studio and you're yeah so we were moving together in the studio cory and i were there in the workspace in the space yeah thank you thank you [Music] i should he was very surprised are hosting this yeah here in the state oh the text went somewhere um thank you for coming and it's good that i mentioned this i see allah okay so i just uh no i was going back to the auto yeah yes so uh okay what happened was yeah we're both uh jorge and i were in the studio and um we were in the same video conference and what happened was that we were looking at each other on the phone but like i was like i was laying down i was laying down yeah yeah i was like i put my phone in front of the chair and like trying to you know fix the phone [Music] yeah so i was like looking at home so before he was you know looking at me but i was somewhere else like in the corner and this is like because you hear like i'm i'm talking from you know like i i say something listen to that like not from the speaker or the phone which also like kind of created weird whole existence in the same space i mean this is something that we use i think that one of the the first thing that i when we start sharing doing the practice that that i found very interesting is that i could get lost because sometimes we were remembering so much we were doing these feedbacks so then sometimes my arm it was cutting in different places and so and then at some point it was not my body but wasn't a mixture between my body and your body and then at the same time sometimes even you're trying to talk and then there's such a delay that i mean the whole confusion comes the reality the reality is the confusion you can i mean you you step away from the what is happening what is happening until you are in flow what we were calling the flow and the flow on you are because you are there and you are just in trance of whoa whoa whoa just taking and taking it and for me it becomes very traumatic that's why i use something this sounded because i feel in this trance yeah but i have to say like so we actually already tried this best practice uh 30 minute version a few days ago which we will do tomorrow at nine european i think um i always have to say this you can find this link in this talk and blah blah blah you will find it if you don't find it you're just not lucky so the app on the app you will find it on the app as part of the official exactly um but you know you were saying that this is this space but what i was saying is when we were moving together because we were in the same space but uh separated by a wall which has green screen on both sides so we're like the first time we were to do that and i have to say i was it was so difficult for me because it's so distracting because i feel the presence of the back and i just couldn't believe like because i always have to like kind of like i'm trying to think about him but i always feel the presence and what i did at the end is just like listen to music and just take off your shirt and go crazy bananas like because i saw you you were like really going for the dance i was like oh yeah there he goes uh and then we were just really going for the dance and that was really cool because i could see you because then i was using this space and sometimes peeping there and then i then you were just like with that without a t-shirt and then just like yeah yeah it was very cool man to see you yeah yeah the reason why i was up naked was just because of the well not just but it was like something that made me the dance we do and also it was something that um oh because of the the the video effect that i was using that i thought it's better than like i was wearing black that black color didn't appear on the screen and my skin is like lighter and it appears better on the screen but i was not like actually showing the original color of the skin so it was not obvious that i was like wearing something or not but yeah but yeah but so that's why like i was playing with that too but yeah so i'm curious like how it's going to be like in the practice tomorrow because yeah i think we will not prepare like prepare the technical setup but we won't tonight we'll just prepare the technical setup at some point but that's it uh yeah but it is i don't know if it could be as well for your sensibility but for me like i could be as well it's because maybe um as i share with you on uh allah yesterday like i have my my my my scars and my my trauma done so then when i see somebody so for me dancing is like it's difficult just to really get just really dancing and then you'll go for the joy and then when i went for reason you were going for the joy like really of dancing and then then i just have you there then i just sleeping and i basically what i'm doing is i'm hacking your energy it's what i was doing as well with your with you yesterday that's the way it's a positive way for me to i just take part of this energy that is this life that is being created there to try to clean to cleanse my my own uh trauma thing um yeah so i i feel like so uncomfortable like coding and like i i really hate coding i have to say uh but i haven't had that moment with you like you have to have the joy of coding and then i can just watch you coding yeah yeah yeah these are part of the constraint that we talk because like then is the body then we have a code that's a part of the constraints like but you know what actually yesterday i told you it was the first time i did a solo you do something solo and then in my room as well i did it just for seven minutes and i published my facebook as i was a public thing so anybody wants to check they can check it on my on my name as public thing um then i was at some point and just uh moving some numbers of course i'm not gonna move so many numbers because you you have more experience than my encoding the but then but then i still i was doing something with the and i was in the flow like i of yeah in the flow of the coding let's say when i was alone and then when i finish i have to think in okay well maybe i can do something like that with you and then right away immediately i remember the conversation and then it's gonna work like that with you because you are there it's the same thing where you're doing your solo then you can do cool stuff you that you you have you are in control i think that's another element that is interesting for saying is that what we do and that's the beauty of what we do is like that we are not in control and we work with a machine that actually suppose we i mean the the medium is the machine and the machine is supposed to be controllable right if i am alone but because i'm with you and your partner constraints the control is gone and that makes the beauty as well because then i have to deal between my fears my desires and the things that i know things that i wish and all the all in between sorry i didn't get like you said when you are alone the constraints are gone i mean let's say let's say they control the constraining you is gone you know like i mean maybe let me put it better like i have more control i mean i mean somehow the control is there because you are not there so yes then i have control of the machine is there for me while you are in so in my constraints you are not existing but when we are doing it live you are there and i don't know what you're gonna do many times sometimes when you're even when you're writing the code i more or less i know where you where you're going so it's and that's part of the dancing that we do you know it's like i see it as a latin dance in that sense like i see it as a cultural dance and then we do in between i go together i go alone i go completely alone i go and peep i go with you a little bit and then just we do this couple dance yeah and computers don't do it uh no i mean let's say you can play with randomness or something when you i mean what i'm saying is it's all about control let's say this is the relevant for the conversation if for other people let's say it's not to follow up like the developing of a conceptual something is just about control when i'm alone i have more control of my constraint my variables as a choreographer i will see part of the elements that i can use in real time for composing um and once you are there as a new constraint because you are alive i don't know what you're gonna do so you yourself you come with tons of constraints that i cannot prevent right so yeah i i i think there are so many things i want to expand on it but um also like well we're not like really strict on time but uh if there's any questions from the floor and i'm really curious to see a question or feedback yes i would like to hear somebody yes allah we love to hear what you think um can you hear me yes if you come close come close even it will be better but we can hear you no yes okay first of all thank you guys for sharing this and for sharing the talk and insights with us i found this very interesting like your input you as a dancer and you as a visual artist um especially the the point where you said that it doesn't really have to be interactive where you are actually creating content that is maybe inspired by the dancer and then this can be developed through rehearsals and so on so it doesn't really have to have this interactive real-time wow effect it just has to be really working coherently with the with the dancer and vice versa because i think also like when you are rehearsing and working together with with the dancer then maybe the dancer would react to your work and you would react to theirs and this would make or create maybe a more valuable experience than just okay something is moving and then you just see the movement of the dancer um affecting it but really no content is being developed um yeah i mean this is my view on the matter are you guys planning to do any live performance yeah tomorrow at nine from nine to ten we we share the practice uh and it's in the schedule you will find a link to follow and to join the will be a similar space yes from 9 to 10 p.m tomorrow it's gonna be this same place the same stage place okay yeah so maybe we can go down and the meat for a gap [Music] i just want to add one thing to what uh allah said and i i i really uh yeah thank you for that um i think it's i i really feel like um that someone you know kind of resonates with this idea also like for me it's really important like how this um this practice i do with jorge is not like you know we create something we prepare some kind of interactive whatever session but we kind of built together during the session and also like like jorge said like one time it's like about interface and this network and this computer is an interface and it's like if for example if the dancer is like moving with a particle it's like the interface is there and also but it's like the dancer and the particles or the system is interacting and it's it's always like hard to make it the hierarchy you know well how hard to make it horizontal it always like makes a hierarchy because someone has the control over something uh most all the time it's a human that dictating and but if we do this practice then you know we're all like kind of equal i wouldn't say equal but we're equally here and what time is it what is this um okay so yes just want to say that it's really important for us to do it like in this format actually it's kind of related to what he said about the solo thing that we do with the computer and not with each other but uh yeah like it's good it's really important to do it as uh yes two that we're not like uh i'm controlling everything on the computer i'm controlling i don't have control over here for example and he doesn't have control over me and that's that's that really creates uh like totally like different uh workflow and process on the good practice compared to the usual dance tech collaboration so yeah i guess i just oh yeah do you wanna have something i just wanted to ask because i just checked um are you based in cologne yeah i um yes ah okay interesting um because i'm based there and i do also such performances but mostly in berlin but yeah this would be interesting to see if you are performing um live somewhere oh you can always see me online okay yeah okay thank you guys thank you for coming and uh yeah uh let's finish here and we can have a real conversation with beer later yeah we go down we meet in the cafeteria okay like now yeah you", "-FCWTnGcGoI": "right right so wait i'm just going to open up all my notes to see where we did the last time yeah so last time we did the practice was thursday so two days ago i guess yeah and how was it uh okay great 19 days 26 26 29 um i felt it felt more organic i think it's slowly yeah i it from easily because i at the beginning i have is often a pressure pressure between i know i have to basically i think the idea of performance of the performativity is something that i think when you are new i think when you are new into something or yeah i think so when you are new with something or when you have too much experience in something i think this idea of performativity which uh meaning that they uh how conscious are you that you are in a state of performativity uh is very difficult to to to step to to keep aside because we talked about before but in the sense yeah but i think the flow i will refer more when you are not aware of that you know like the flow will i will said when you actually are in between don't uh being an amateur and being a professional uh when you're in that in the middle space because then you can stay being aside from the from the performativity itself i think uh from the pressure off or not knowing enough then you have to be concerned about practical things of your matter or knowing too much then when you are concerned because you have this material in your head and you would like to use it as a content uh i think when you are in between this space is when you can be relaxed uh in term in terms in terms of performativity i think yeah maybe that's the way i'm describing that because there was a way who i'm feeling now like to say like not martin kind of performativity i guess yeah but i think it's it's related in the sense that it's a contradiction because that comes from this book of um that i'm reading now uh that apparently is very important in performance art i mean yeah performance art and and in general in feminism um uh this course and feminist discourse yeah uh it's called uh his book of judith butler called um yeah i don't remember now but it's a book and he mentioned that book in that interview for instance and because that's that's a book that they when you go to path for instance is in pub there is a uh when you enter there is this uh table with books that you can take for free at some point that was uh the movie and research was part of these books which are books that are being somehow or greeting path or sponsor i mean somehow connected to puff and but as well then you find some books often there and this book i remember was there often i mean i remember just the image because when after i saw the martin's interview that the last one the [Music] uh that you sent me then he speaks at some point about and he refers constantly about this book and um and and and then i was researching a bit more and apparently it's a book that influenced many things because that bowman speaks they're very specific about performativity in the sense that everybody that you are performing like you with your clothes now you are performing uh a gender that to me with my clothes uh we perform a gender and that we are not aware of and all the consequences that this have this thing have like between the idea of what i'm supposed what is a man let's say in terms of gender uh what is like the society spec you for being a man to perform uh yeah so [Music] so that's and he i think in that conversation he was mixing that between is the way he was separating dancing from dance and yeah other topics that maybe yeah i don't remember by hard these things but then so the idea i don't know if maybe because i'm mixing these things so what then is some somehow mixed between that like because i'm getting because i'm reading this book and other one that is part of a group of uh transition about the colonization of knowledge that is a group is called uh yeah the asymmetry group and the idea is basically to work towards asymmetries starting in path asymmetries in different levels and but then to see around different topics and one topic is about decolonization of knowledge for instance and yeah it's a very and so these things are very are very current on my oh my doing nowadays and i think are very complicated things because are very sensible in different ways and [Music] so i guess when i'm and that's something maybe in frankfurt that already i thought i would like to talk with you as well to see how what you think how we feel about some things but when we see each other then we can talk um but then when i when i refer in our practice about this idea of i think in the just in the last few sessions i feel slowly more free or more in relation between the elements that i have in let's say my technical elements and my frustration and as well your presence because um that's something that is cool know that i think you're pre i see my i understand my setup so you are not part of my setup because you are a presence in you see like you are not my setup you are something that i'm working with so even though you are just a flat image like if i compare with my setup my things you're just a flat image is uh my intentions that's what i was feeling the last time like i i can i slowly i'm slowing down sometimes what i'm doing and then i try to as well to see what you do and if i will start moving as well i will be jumping between uh or i was doing that the last time or moving um with the feeling that you give me or that the feeling in general that i perceive from what i'm doing including you as a as a message or moving by technical means of what do i want to portray including you as a straight line i mean could be even a straight line like a code like color fading uh delays like and then in between these two things the last time i was doing and then i can feel my body reacting to that differently because all of these things that i'm saying there were thoughts so that really conscious uh i will say frameworks in my head basically it's me saying now i'm gonna feel you know between i'm feeling and or and doing well more yeah more i'm moving more in a technical matter within everything that i have as well then the perception of you then will be yeah will be different than just the feeling yeah i think that's something that it happened to me the last time i could say it so resume i was between these two aspects of feeling uh or or technically doing yeah the two were different i don't know if that makes sense to you or how can you really relate this to your uh your experience yeah um well at some point i was thinking about something else and uh but i thought okay this is recorded so maybe it's okay if i just skip a little bit and listen to it again so i do i don't question again what you said but i kind of understand what the technical setup and the presence of each other uh but what i wanted to say what i was thinking on the side was like this started feel like you know um this conversation like um in a in a dance like workshop like contemporary dance like you kind of everyone moves and then after that like you know you make a circle and talk about the experience kind of thing and this is like in the last few sessions in this chat i didn't think about it it was really like just talking but today i really feel that i don't know why maybe i'm just sitting on the the floor i mean the big bag so that's why i made this feel that that's this kind of you know sitting in a circle experience or maybe because also like i think how i started this conversation was kind of weird that like i asked you like really formally like we did this practice two days ago and how was your experience that was really like a bad introduction i'd say how was your experience yeah it was exactly you know what i mean what is it i mean i understand what you mean like it's exactly what what somebody will start saying okay so how's your experience if you're in a dance world exactly like that but i think that's so cool no i mean i just it's i think it's funny sorry i think it's funny that uh sorry i think it's funny that we kind of like it was for me it was really awkward but then that kind of revealed something and connection to other experience that's kind of not what ex yeah that's kind of interesting to think about but what do you want to say no but i think what i found interesting from this topic now that we are reflecting about what we are doing is that uh i mean what we are doing what we are doing this is that uh it becomes uh so personal while still then then you have to express you know that's what it has danced that's what is beautiful in that context know that people really have to say things you know and this many times it's just if you are sick if you remember being in a work in a dance workshop because you are giving your body you're really there um then when people express a really yeah that really is their their life basically is their life in the time space in a in a time space um what life or life plus i think i think it's life in the sense that in that moment i will say that one person can be when you're in a dance workshop if you're if you have some uh task then you will be framed you're frank no somebody said like you guys have 15 minutes you have you can use only lines and your arms and you have to follow your elbows so that's very there's very specific and then you will go for it and that moment i guess most often is the case that nobody's gonna push you to go and follow such a workshop so if you are there is because you really want to do that and you will be really following that so from that point of view you are fully in flow and for you at that moment is nothing else existing more than you and in the space and time and you you are framed in a your time frame of life is very defined your dimensionality from that point of view your dimension is very defined and because it's so intense afterwards you have to speak about it and that's what i'm trying to say like the things that people said are so personal you know like like i mean they're really speaking from their heart and then sometimes they take or more time less time but for sure they're sometimes even you know when you listen you don't make sense of what they're saying uh but for them it's really it's so real you know for when you are there it's real because it's a strong experience yeah and it's abstract and it's complete and it's what i think i'm trying to relate with what we're doing is that it's abstract in the sense it's dance you know like there's dances so it's abstract if you'll take an imaginary what we do with visuals is abstract but it's real so then you're trying to put that in words and that's why it becomes you got you have this giggling sensation you know like like but it's never recorded in the dance studio uh it was very rarely recorded like normally what you have is other people watching yeah i mean even for the conversation like people take notes but it's not recorded i mean i i understand that's how it is and you know some people don't want to be recorded but maybe it's it's interesting it's a good time to think about why and like should we just like record it in some cases maybe not i don't know i don't know how people feel about this but because we are like so used to like record i mean the sessions are all recorded and even this chat is recorded and yeah like i think it's it's okay like because to me i i'm fine like recorded all the time um sometimes i feel like even if i'm in the bathroom i should like kind of being performative that you know i'm fine if i'm recorded so i don't know this is just weird but um i'm not thinking about bathroom but like because the reason why i feel not recording in a dance studio is i feel recording in the dance studio is not appropriate because people don't like it but then if i'm alone then it's fine recording and and probably if you're there and if we agree then it's fine doing it and i think we should like stop thinking that because others are not comfortable don't do that like i mean it makes sense for some cases but like we should at least ask that question you know are you well i i think it also depends on the context but uh yeah like because i i keep thinking thinking about like how we change the notion of dance studio like how we work how we create works like i think this is something i said last time but with regards to that like it's interesting to think about like if we go back to the dance studio for example in that classical well not classical uh floor like what if we record it and how is it what's going to bring to that yeah what yeah i i think i think there is something that uh i think when we see each other then is the thing is because there is this like in this point what we're doing there is a uh directionality some kind of like there's a vector like the vector that that i think we have i have my vectors when we perform is like going in that direction you know my attention and the things that i do it goes to you so my attend that my attention and my intention goes toward my screen which because i'm it's clearly that what i'm trying to do is going to be shared with you uh does that make my intentionality because you are just in this frame that i have right so if i want to share a message i need to put it through the space um i think that will change when we see each other because then for it as the direct the directionality of what we do there is not a frame for instance and so then that's i think that was part of the thing that i said the last time when we talked uh about when i when i mentioned about interfaces and is that because it is it's not about i think it's not about like we really need to have our internet or something in particular but i think because so far then when we said when we speak about practices there is something that is filtering basically the my intentionality before it passes through you that in this case is the computer then there's an interface and then then that's what i said i think uh there should be an interface while we're working in this framework i don't know what what is the interface and if you're basically there yes yes because and i think it's because of the the direct i think it has to be with the intention and the that the direction of my doing that because i don't know how yeah because there is there is my that i will feel there is i feel that that is because there is an interface i don't know how will be like yeah but i think that's those are things that we have to try like how can i like that's what i think the same one of the simple examples and still is the same is the interface with a piece of paper if i have a piece of paper and i draw something my intention still will go or i do something with the paper doesn't have to be drawn with the paper but if i just take my paper and i do what i have to do then after i just uh that my intention is still is is let's say is towards a work that i'm doing together with you but i'm not my interaction is not with you but it's with the interface and at some point you have to you have to have the paper which has my intentions given to you and then you have to do the same exercise um which is the same like so you interpret somehow what is happening and then you put your directionality in the in that sense and i see yeah you see what i mean and and what i'm speaking is about here is in is about vectors and vectors uh slash directionality intentions you know like in this clear framework that we have is clear yeah i have like a few ideas around this actually this is something i wanted to mainly talk about today um so going back to the the last practice i i don't know if you noticed but i wasn't using hydra and i was using only obs studio like virtual cam just overlaying my self on top of your image uh the reason why i did it is i thought it it will have less delay and it was true i think so the video you transmitted was sent back to you with my body in it and that that was like much much faster than doing it through hydra for some reason i don't know like screen sharing and all these things slows down so obvious somehow but at the at the end you use hydra or at some point you use hydra no the code was codos for the sound ah the the hydra code is for the sound it's not hydra actually i would like other editor that has a code in it and i took that from obs to overlay as well but i was not editing video at all okay but at some point i think i see like you you have some um yeah your skin was completely white or black the three you were using threshold at some point you know but look again i i haven't watched it uh afterwards so i cannot recall but if there was something probably it was something with the obs studio and and okay so and again so you were doing that to test the speed of the the real time speed yeah i mean of course it's not real time it's still like a few second delay but it's smoother i would say just to see what how it changes our interaction and i i don't know like i don't for now i don't make any observation or any statement uh yeah i need to watch it again and but for the experience wise i think it also helped that you were using hydra all the time so it was already some generative images from you and i was just overlaying on top of it but that already created something interesting and i see that my body was sent back to me because you know you were using that as well yeah that was something and then i started to think this is the second point i wanted to relate to what you said but um i don't know if you follow uh or you know any annie abrahams she's doing like net art uh remote performance with uh with daniel as well um annie annie i think i is she live she lives in germany is that i think she lives in france can you tell me there something a baller or her name yeah i'll do it later okay but why you mention her so i also invited her to the festival because she's doing this 15 minute session uh she's been doing this for like quite a long time like not every week but uh once in a while she does a series of uh sessions that people meet in zoom and they have two versions one is people just sit down and close eyes and just contemplate for 15 minutes with eyes closed eyes closed yeah but sound is on and the other one is uh i think there are like three people annie and daniel and miriam they kind of give not instruction but like you know talk through the session um about the body or your feeling and people yeah i think i saw one of these yeah and that's that's daniel lisa yeah lisa i don't know if lisa is doing this uh together still but uh she was part of it and uh so they kind of you know have this kind of um practice that yeah but mainly they close their eyes which is quite interesting i think because i when i tried something with lisa and daniel we were like well they they kind of suggested to you know close eyes and move together um but like our practice is like so far it's it's really visual right yeah like i try to make sound but it's not like the main thing and it's not like about making sound from the body or you know like with the voice but it's more like synthetic synthesized sound and um i think it's not like which is good which is better or worse but like we have like we're starting to see like different practices which kind of you know addresses the main idea and also like what daniel wrote in the email you know like about uh what what was it like methodology or something like academic technologies yeah it's like to check like how what is what are the things that are happening i mean basically what we're discussing these things you know like what are the things that yeah methodology yeah so yeah i think we don't have to like you know list up everything but it's it's good to know like which direction we're taking and yeah like at one point maybe we should try like closing eyes which might be hard for what we do but oh but you know it's weird that you that you mentioned that because i woke up this morning with with uh i have uh anxiety and then some let's say uh in some periods and after summer i have anxiety and and then i need to meditate more than what i do uh i try to meditate every day and then if i if i have anxiety i need to meditate that's the way who i i yeah i don't kill myself i guess it's always um that's so then then after that practice at some point because i was reflecting a bit about because in my my practice i was trying to be uh to use uh gratitude then i was then i was feeling gratitude about uh this the exchange that we have the the meetings that we have and then i was feeling as well with my computer and then gratitude of the computer and at some point uh they yeah just i i thought yeah i remember yeah actually i remember in the practice but it happens at some point was i don't know if you realized at some point yeah when at the end we were both we were moving quite fast at some point i stopped moving i was not moving and and then i was just i was more than looking i was trying to be contemplative and this idea of the closing up so i was more in the state of meditation than looking because like what i do right now even if i will not be speaking even if i'm speaking is looking at the computer right yeah uh this which is i mean similar if you will not be moving your head is what you do right now you're looking at your computer because i'm speaking so at that moment when i stopped moving i was just more flat contemplative of what was happening which which was a lot of your movements but then but yeah so i'm mentioning that because at that point i was feeling very yeah i think at some point even for a second i guess in my head it should pass the idea to close my eyes but i did not because somehow i thought i needed to look at you or to be there with my eyes openable so it's funny that you mentioned this because i already in the last practice i i felt contemplative which is close to yeah that's close to my person the person that i am um and that's connected to what i was saying before i think it's slowly what we do even though like the output is visual uh always is visual because we export it and we that's the framework that we just that we we proposed is is slowly it seems that it's becoming more more in dense i feel that is the dance's presence regardless of the motion you know regardless of how much are we dancing i feel that we speak or we do more dance we yeah uh yeah i feel that we do more we work more in dance with the choreographic aspect of it that's how i feel um interesting uh yeah i don't know about that last part but i think yeah when you said you were just watching the screen i don't know if i notice that i have to watch it again like um because i feel like i think i noticed that and reacted somehow or did i i don't know um maybe then you were moving at that moment because that was the last two minutes the last to the last two three minutes we both were moving quite fast and i remember because i was doing this thing because i have this i was doing this with my hair notice but yeah yeah so because you were moving very fast yeah that's it like also like i was what i was what i was thinking is i was moving fast but i was not watching the screen at all because i was well i was listening to the sound i was making and also this is another thing that i think on top of another topic but i i think i sent the sound at one point and then i stopped it until the end i didn't send the the you know the sound i was working on [Music] yeah yeah yeah yeah i was sending my iphone but yeah but because i felt like well at first i felt it's a bit like you know i was a bit shy and also like that day i wasn't really fully like mentally prepared for this so i was like i was not really happy with what i was doing and then okay whatever and then also i thought it's okay if we don't you know share everything you know like if i'm just working on that thing that sound and if i just use that for myself it doesn't really matter if you listen to that or not anyways you see that my body so um so then i just stopped it and yeah at one point i was somewhat happy with the sound so i just kept moving and moving and didn't really uh of course i didn't listen to what you were doing like this environmental sound from you i wasn't sure at all and i was not looking at the screen either so what did i want to say yeah like i think there's like about the sound i was sending or not that was like conscious decision of what kind of interface or the channel that i want to connect with you and also yeah like at the end i think we're like both like different ways but kind of not well i would say like both we were both like kind of meditating and contemplating but it doesn't really but you were looking at the screen and i was not looking at the screen it seems to me like the in the last session i feel that we both we were working uh more often together than in the last session and i don't know it has to be related because then you were not having hydra on top of that not because i didn't and i just i didn't know that you didn't have hydra on that uh not just now you say that but something that i really felt could be partly because i was consciously trying to work between jumping in my constraints that's something that maybe as well i would like to propose maybe finish what i'm saying and then i will hold it then is that i was trying to jump between my co my my constraints and that's what i refer like for me is slowly the practice becomes more choreographic even though the the output is visual like then as as as me as as as dancer in my in the choreography that i'm proposing that i i'm defining unconsciously i guess or consciously uh slash unconsciously i will i have defined what are my constraints and then i will be jumping between them meaning one body one body in relation with another body one body alone one body with my comp with my with myself one body with my code one body uh with bdmx one body with ddmx and you like all these constraints like all these puzzles constantly and that's what i re that's what i refer about the choreographic aspects of it then because then the constraints uh get repeated because that's what we do in the practice basically then in my in my in my in my constraints i i repeat my constraints so they get more set in my head so i know i will use four channels for instance and then i know i will use for because i have some midi control then i know i need to have my midi control has a space for more i guess more than 30 faders and but i will just put four because i just need four and things like that so those are my constraints and between them then i i let myself in a ground in a big scale will be between the feeling just doing i don't know what i'm doing and then i don't know what are the constraints or the actual thought of thinking what i'm doing and then trying to build basically image imaginary on my visuals but then i defined this two differently uh yeah i already said that at the beginning and i think what what what what i was trying to say the whole and you and is when you said you don't look at the screen and you're working in the visual and the sound at some point i think all those things are completely fine because you're a person you know it will be not fine if i'm if i'm with a robot then it's different but because you're a person then you have your own days and your own things i think that's that's completely that's part of what we do but what i think it makes a difference is like when you define when uh what are your constraints and then you can jump between them um yeah yeah so in that sense like i think um i have two things i wanted to say i don't know which should come first but uh maybe i start with the second one you know it's just that uh yeah like switching between these constraints or i don't know how to say like yeah constraints i i feel that constraints might not be the right word but let's let's keep that um it's at first i thought like this session could be like 30 minutes i think that's what i proposed you know but we stick to one hour and it's actually good that we do it for one hour because then we can kind of experiment with different constraints and if we fail that's also okay but i think if it's like 20 minutes or 30 minutes then we have to somehow like stick to one thing and more it's more like you know it's it's gonna be like more scent and it's yeah i think i have to be like aware that okay i'll do i'll spend first 10 minutes with hydra to make some kind of visual and then make the sound or like i wouldn't probably even think about using sound and which is a composition i mean those but this thing that's a composition now like that from a choreographic aspect is a composition that's what you will do as creator when you are in dance then you will do then does you choose how to uh divide the time space that you have yeah and also this is something i talked last time i think the you know i want something to put on instagram which kind of makes it even harder like if you i stick to that idea that i want to have something for instagram and i only have 30 minutes then that's like you know basically i'm just like straight going to this instagramable moment and yeah it might be interesting but you know like with this yeah i have it as well for me like then i i know but then for me it's like at some point there are some images that are very cool so then at some point i knew okay now then i took like 20 screenshots at that moment and then after i just select one of those or if if one of these screenshots are not working because let's say i'm trying to move from the same time take the string screenshot that's difficult so but then i know in my head i know what moment was interesting for me to go back in the recording and then excuse me so it's like annotation kind of yes but but but still i'm thinking because i'm actually i'm promoting this more than you so that's and that's kind of a role that i like to take so i promoted it and then i attack you and then i do as well like when is the night i said tonight best practices so then i'm thinking as well in the image no but then the image it will at some point while we're doing things but that's that may be it's kind of like the difference that we we're having in the sense of because you but i don't know if it's true or not but it's because i think let's say if you if we work if we work with hydra then you have way more things to play with there around then i don't have so many things to play around so i have basically two options or one is uh one is like or i stress really while like trying to to work in hydra in the performance i mean in the best practice so in one hour one is that and the other one is just take something some code that already i know already is working and then just modify some numbers and with some basic understanding um but for use different your experience because then you know your your your information is way broader than mine in that case um yeah but that's the something i wanted to the first point i wanted to say was that last time because i didn't use hydra that made me like really uh well at first i was so frustrated that that i tried to figure out how to use obs virtual cam and hydra together that it didn't work well so at the same time at the same time within the practice you were doing that in that hour or before at first or maybe before that i was preparing a bit and it didn't work so i was like okay well i think in the practice actually like i looked like looked in again that was something with the configuration but it didn't work and then i was like okay i'll just stick to the safe side which is what's working right now with the obs which means that i cannot use hydra and that made me you know that already gave a constraint i was forced to you know switch between different tools because i don't have an option to stick to hydra for the rest of the hour to you know like be on the safe side and make some visuals that i'm comfortable but because of that i don't know but yeah but now i understand that before because of that then what i thought it was that you were more contemplative contemplative trying to be more recipient of what was happening that was the feeling that i got i didn't know that you were not using hydra so i just thought because i i told you often you're like very looking and then sometimes you were just moving and doing something like image based on my image that because you were using them so then i thought that was your proposal uh yeah that's the they didn't know that was that was really interesting moment that uh i i don't know exactly why i was moving like this but i remember i was i was doing this quite long and yeah i think i was coding sound and it took so long because i'm not so used to it and but i for some reason i'm just like i can code like this i think that's kind of my habit to you know like look somewhere did you but did you realize that as well i was doing the same did you i think i noticed quite late like not immediately but at some point i i noticed and then then i got like really like self-conscious that oh i'm moving that i i yeah i was conscious that i was giving like different impression to you that i was intentionally doing something like this you probably thought that way but i was just coding and that's how i caught it okay that's very cool yeah yeah that was that was really fun yeah yeah that was yeah i i really like that moment i have to re-watch this this this is really cool i should i in youtube i should have this uh the video link that goes to that part of that video in this chat you know yeah yeah uh well i i don't know if i can do it but um it's like the link like the link of what we're saying like now yeah like the reference to you know this video because well actually this is quite important because now we're doing annotations but like of course there's like something that links to each other and we didn't use i didn't we didn't use the clock i thought at some point i didn't use the club recording i i totally forgot about it but it's okay like it's fine you know it's just happening yeah but we prefer to do it just at the beginning like then yeah yeah you know next time so that we next time we remember like it's just for a second in our recording we can try to record them i was happy because i was using this and i feel there was because there was something green so it was just reflecting passing the image and i was very happy with this i just i just want a few minutes before is this are these kind of things to to put these things i thought wow wow and uh yeah and yesterday i bought not two days ago i bought a a chroma t-shirt a green t-shirt i want to try it this is something like i was talking with nyan the the dancer um and uh yeah we want to do something with green objects and she's collecting so many things and i haven't got anything except like a piece of paper but so i have to look look for that today maybe or maybe i can i can spend like a few days in frankfurt because i'm free and i'm buying okay i think we can stop around here for the recording yeah wait wait maybe let me just reframe to what i put in my notes afterwards dance i don't know what is that recording vectors yeah i think i like this idea of for me it's in terms of like um dance no not only in terms of what we're doing seems to me like there are some things that for me my understanding they're more clear and as as a constraint or as something that is like this idea of the of the intentionality the vectors and the direction and how we work because it's is it's true it is towards you i mean it is towards the screen so my intentions even though what i'm doing here things meaning that my directions go here and here my intentionality goes there even what i'm doing here i'm still projecting towards you even when i'm moving here my my intention is going to you without regardless that my arm is not there i'm going with you when i'm there and that thing that seemed to me there is something very clear um yeah yeah i i also think about like it's not to me it's not like a direction that goes to the screen but it's more like a frame but it's but it's the same thing right it's like where i am in the frame and how i'm using the frame and that's yeah in the end it's the same thing i think because i think those things are like the intentionality you know like if you talk more about vectors could be more or vectors of direction that could be a bit more uh elusive but if you talk about intention is more clear in the world like my intention even though my arm is not going there my intention when i talk here is going there right it's not going there yeah when i talk when i'm moving here my intention is going towards you that's the intentionality and that's something that i think is very it's very defined in the framework that we are presenting now just to keep to keep in mind all right uh maybe i was thinking because uh maybe we can do the practice if it's possible for you maybe on wednesday could you instead of thursday night traveling on thursday i mean wait can i stop the recording now yes yes", "BOUUD72e0EY": "okay so uh what what what was it when we were talking uh uh ah yeah yeah like how um yeah it's about the translation you see like the a translation between what artists want what really takes for the developer to come up with the idea so yeah i know like it's about the translation it's always i think it's many times it's about the translation for instance like if i'm working as developer for somebody else because i completely don't understand let's say a part of the abstractions of the poetics that we took the last week you know a part of this abstraction that doesn't already completely complicate level just the technical part you know just the technical part it will take you as a developer and normal time until you understand the tool and then so you first you need to get to know the tool if it's something that is somehow is is new i don't know it's a sensor let's say it will take you anyway sometime until you understand what you can do with it and then after you can then put the wishes of the artist there right in that case so the artist had some kind of idea that what they want right yeah yeah and then and you're and you are not working let's say artistically you are not you're just like executing something you are not trying to translate poetry too much it's just technical and it's still like the timing is is very blurry you know and for the artist because you are that's the thing you know when you work then for the artist you are a technician in a way you're a developer you're a technician you're executing so the artists don't really want to deal with it and because of that if you don't if you don't prevent if you don't foresee that's some things that just come with experience if you don't foresee that you gonna need more time then you might end up yourself in some deadline that you don't want to be because then you're going to be really stressed out working for i don't know four or five days like no sleep and not being happy that's i think that's another uh maybe a question that i would like to do ask you like then this idea of because when you're working with some yeah there's one thing of when you're happy with your work you know there's one thing when you're when you are the artist then in a way yet you have control of that but then when you're working with somebody else and the person is asking you to work with thermodynamics or what a robot and you by yourself you would like to do some i mean something that you feel happy with it you know what i mean but many times yeah i mean the happiness maybe comes from the money but um you know that's let's put this aside but um yeah because of course like for me i do you know this kind of gig that i paid and i make something i write code to you know realize something and um in rare case it's something that i have like you know like i talk with artists and we find something that's interesting through the discussion and experimentation but uh often the case is that um the artist wants something very specific and i need to try to you know get to that point with the program and um sorry the video is a bit uh glitchy today but yeah what i wanted to say is um what did i want to say yeah so in that case like i have to make something that's always always really difficult because if you achieve something then okay maybe they're happy but then if you fail that's you know sad it's it's always like you know maybe you can surprise the artist with whatever that comes more than what they expect but it's it's that's really rare you know it it's uh it's hard to um disappoint them but it's making them happy is very hard and then the happy happiness for myself it's also really hard because of course i learned something while coding you know for someone else it's not like making a website so it's i mean of course making website i learned something as well but um it's very often it's really specific project that i would never do for by myself which um or like they have really um strange ideas that in a sense that i would never do because i know that it's gonna fail or i know that it's uh you know uh yeah i don't know like it's just you know some someone did like decades ago but you still they still want to do or like something that i don't want to do but then if i try to do it then maybe that's something interesting in it or even if it's something that for example like the client wants something with face tracking and i've done face tracking a lot and i'm kind of tired of it but still do it and then but still like you know because it's a very different setup that it's commercial and they have their like a different kind of demand that um i learned something from it you know i would try something that i would never really come up with or i just ignore some ideas and then through these projects i actually do it and i learn and often i take these ideas i cannot reuse exactly the code i mean i actually i can but maybe the the output the appearance should be different from you know how they do it in their installation for example or performance but um i still reuse it for what i do because it's quite interesting as an idea that i think it's it's something that is like um as a property intellectual property i mean often we don't really sign these you know difficult uh complicated contracts but uh it's something that i make with them for them but it's also like a you know collaborative thing that it's not like hundred percent uh i own or they 100 own unless we sign a contract like that so yeah that's something interesting yeah i think from what you're saying i i i put it as uh in in my notes as a i put it as a stupid ideas client but as a positive thing i put it in my in my in my notes is like like those ideas that in your head you will not try because in your head are like the reason that you gave no so i put it like in my head are like stupid ideas that only i will try because somebody's asking me and it's paying me for that and because of that then you can realize that while you're doing that then you enter into places that you will not have been because you will not conceive to try something that is old or that you think it might not be possible or just a waste of time and all these reasons right i didn't thought of that the thing is yeah i i felt like yeah i remember when i when i started the working in production and design because now i'm being a bit reflecting because i have to give a video for the for the node festival right then i was adapting my view and then i was thinking then i was going back in time and i remember clearly like when 2015 i decided okay now i want to do more than just being an artist i want to try to work uh them to then because i wanted to just basically spread out more the message then i thought uh it needs to i wanted to work with production and art direction basically and then during doing these things then i thought very clear when when then when i was chat when you're challenging with a challenge you're challenged when you have a client when you're working with somebody else because you have to make yourself i mean if i'm working for myself on the sake of art i can make i can you find your own language you create your own language and when you're working for somebody else it's very challenging because then you have to for instance in my experience because i'm coming from the art field i have been the artist and then in a way i remember when i was like some time ago then i was doing something in a theater and then i thought like man i'm working as technician and that was kind of an inside joke to my stealth because then i have been the artist like who is complaining to the technician and and i think that's the whole yeah i think what what when i see when i think in terms of my own path and uh what i see like the like the power of the of the thing that i have is that i have the speech in the both directions which it happens with you with dance as well you know that you know some things that the only way that you can know about it is being there in the place um or in the field you know and yeah and i think it's very challenging when when you have to work for somebody else it's not always pleasant but you learned a lot right yeah it's yeah i think that's true i mean it depends like sometimes it's just you know at the end everyone's not happy and i just well i yeah but i i learned something at least you know by like making something because there's always something that you don't expect would happen like it's it's hard to give an example but um yeah even with like unhappy collaboration like because always you know it's it's really like like especially for performance i mean same for the installation but you have the constraint with the space and what equipment you have like maybe the projector is not big enough or you know like the there's like a strange delay strange noise coming so you have to like replace some of the equipment with uh something that has low like slower capacity or something and then you have to be kind of creative quote unquote i i don't know if it's the right word but um because of my heart yeah but i think that's that's exactly what uh you know how he frames the creative because what i'm saying is you know that you have the constraint and somehow you have to be creative to solve that you know that's not possible without being creative you know no um yeah so so there's something um yeah i don't know if i want to continue this but uh i i wanted to share with you some wait but uh it's the last time what uh no this is mine want text concept oh yeah so this was what no no no um it's because the last time when we where is it content content digital this one should be here practice yesterday oh yeah so i are going to read something that i just write yesterday when i finish it says uh so it says i'm happy me hyper me moving me message me meaning me mining me chill me out i can't control what i what i want to you want to i'm not i'm not peace of mind that was what i crowed like um like after practicing yesterday yeah yeah so then i just put it like sometimes i do as a practice as well when i i learned from a woman called leonardo bauer um it's part of like uh writing practices from dance so then right after then we were dancing so that you are hyped then just you go and then you grind something uh and then there were some specific exercises with her but so it was not specifically for this but it's very similar in the in that framework we just finished and i just i see and and i remember that because we have the last time this conversation about uh kind of like uh yeah we talk about messages um what is this i cannot find when was the last time we talked the ayah 15 and i put in my notes here delivered messages and we talked about tools [Music] so then i thought a bit of that and it was very interesting because since we we use almost like 45 minutes on explaining this and hydro thing just in the last 15 minutes i didn't care about anything because like first i didn't even open my normally i will handle some things between my bdmx and i just or i would connect my other screen or like have different setups i mean i would have normally my setup is big um as you can imagine like from from all the smoking machines and things yeah but uh but then yesterday because it was just so short then then i was really moving and dancing and i felt really happy uh and but at the same time then i was looking at you so this was conscious i was conscious of when i was going by myself and when i was go with you it was the first time because i mean maybe first time conscious i guess before it happened but because we have this conversation about message and basically because it slowly you start talking what in my what in my head from my thoughts it's about composition tools that start rising in the practice things that i can pick up points in what i'm doing the practice with you then um i was i was waiting sometimes and or i was just i guess conscious unconsciously being in relation with you [Music] yeah yeah and then i found the need as well to to put to put words i i think i share a window with words uh yeah i haven't i haven't watched it yet but uh yeah i i saw some uh text editor or something that you were there and yeah i mean actually what you're gonna find there is no more than it's just very i i think i growed at some point i don't know why because you were because the song because the song was like the song was like hey it just seems like okay um yeah how was the experience for you oh you're drinking mate out yeah we don't have in belgium belgium people don't drink the thing that much it's not so often you can find i really like it in germany you find it everywhere yeah somehow it's a german thing i mean of course it's not german thing but it's german things is colonized by german yeah that's another idea i would like to discuss with you but let's i want to hear first how you felt yesterday yeah um there's a few things i want to talk about but first i think because you said the words and i think it was really interesting that um my setup like i would suppose well i wanted to do something that the visual react to the sound like last time i i did as a solo and this was not somehow it was not configured properly and i think at one point there's like this shape in the background like before we went to this performance practice like when i was explaining something i think i was just playing in the background audio reactive shape yeah and and that was like like funny accident that um it was not picking up the sound that i'm generating but it was picking up your voice that was really funny because then we could do like so many things with that you know like yeah so but wait let me try to understand then because i saw it i mean i watch it uh fast and and then i saw at some point when then we were talking and then i was talking because i couldn't see that ball when we were i mean while we were because i cannot see your screen you know i think you were not sharing that screen with me at that point perhaps yeah but then in the composition i see the when i'm talking then there's this ball that i thought of whoa that's a bit weird because my voice like they're behind of you big brother talking to you in your back it's very very funny but wait so and is that audio reactive from hydrogen hey well the visual is hydra and i wanted to i wanted that to react to uh the sound i was making with tidal cycles so what then normally you will put from from hydra you will put the audio to listen to your microphone no it's a i set up something like in like a internal loopback so what's sent to you or what's sent to my headphone it's also sent to like a virtual uh loopback and i i set the chrome to listen to that so that hydra was actually listening to not the microphone but to the uh the sound i was making and your voice as well but it was i think it was reacting just to my voice not to yours yeah it was weird i i don't know if there's something set up wrong and i i was like i actually i was so yesterday i was really frustrated like with that uh somehow it was not working as i expected and also you know it took so long for you know setting up all the things and i i felt like when i started for the last 10 15 minutes i was like so frustrated you know like come on like we wasted so much time and i want to do like so many things and i cannot do it um and also like i think i started to have this in mind that because i kind of upload images or videos every time when i do it so i what i start to feel like i want a nice image you know i i want a nice image to share like this is it's ridiculous like now i feel like what i was thinking like just it doesn't make sense to go for that you know it's but no but but it seems to me like you know it's just it's like i think it's i think it's okay as as if as you when you are not the victim of it you know it is like the same reason for i like to buy things from brands like and i'm really i try to be ecological and try i mean i i think is completely going against my political position and i'm completely unsustainable in the way who i have you have no i think i have more than 40 50 part of shoes for instance i have a problem buying shoes for instance and what i'm trying to say with this is that um it's like first like people if somebody's watching that people should not buy so many shoes is not good um but then is that uh i think as long you know that something is happening you know i mean as long as you're not suffering from as long as i'm not suffering from my problem then it's okay because then otherwise will be like the same but it happens from the alcoholic who drinks to forget that is a drunk right and that's horrible you see what i mean that if you you can and if there are some things that in somehow there they might create conflict in my head for some reason and that could be many so let's say one of this is like i like to take as well uh i what i do is take a screenshot so i shared my screenshot yesterday i took a i i take a screenshot sometimes so if my if for some reason i kind of have a conflict uh define it within me uh between i should be focused in being here not focused in the screenshot or many other thoughts in my head i think that that's that's a problem that's already super big you know because i can make it as big as i can because i can put things on top thinking that i'm not respecting your time or that i'm respecting my time i mean so many things that it's too late or the yeah i could put so many things and make the problem as complicated as nobody will ever understand not even myself so that's something that uh i can try i cannot erase but i think if on top of that i tr i am worried because i have that big problem then that's that's what it does what a i put example of the alcoholic who drinks to forget that is drunk does uh which happens no then otherwise you end up i think so yeah like if what if i have a problem with something it's okay as long as i'm not suffering from it i see that's how i feel from i mean that's how i try to not be hard with things i see i don't know how you how you see because then we can put this in terms of like yeah yeah if i think about computers then i'm really hard but that's right i try yeah because i think for instance because i'm new with the defeat in the field i was for instance like uh i have to repeat this thing the of the for i have to repeat this uh web stack uh i i make the for my school i create this website there is a full stack with the back front end and the back end that i told you i spent about i counted with uh with a tool that i can count hours i count 169 hours of my of my time which is that's a lot and which is about that means six hours working uh for three months more or less and then i i didn't pass i didn't pass i was like when i got the that's that it was the day that i did not something because i have kind of like a thing if i gonna fight because i thought it was not fair uh i even pay for a bootcamp i spend a lot of time in that so when that happened i feel you know completely defeated i feel stupid as well because i thought come on i mean and as well as a part of feeling stupid that was me with myself i thought it was not fair and all these kind of things so in a situation like this it's very difficult to not be mad at me for different reasons uh but because it's something new for about working with computers but then for instance just with now there's a bit more days that pass already then i know i spend way too much time studying because that's the way i do a lot i prepare way too much and then when i have to execute let's say i prepare what i really from the 169 hours i think i worked maybe 10 hours 12 hours on the on my assignment for real you see and the rest were just studying i and basically what i was trying to do is like learn the whole javascript the whole javascript like i went to really some advanced things like in theory that i should not that i don't i didn't probably there are so many things that i don't know yeah so i don't know like go ahead yeah javascript like it's it's it's it's it's just it's the is the language of the website there's so many shits that are there and i i bought this uh javascript bootcamp and it was complete and i was keep on following things that i mean they just asked me to do backhand from front-end communicate with the the with the uh with mongodb and so yeah but for reason that's that's the way why that's that's that's like being honest like that's those are those are my my weak points you know like i can recognize and that's because of me and my ego you know because because it's i'm it's my ego i think it's a fight between my ego and my fears in terms of like i don't know why i didn't start working on that before i work in the i was working against in with my deadline you know just the last few hours working on that i have three four months for work on that i went to path to be alone to not be disturbed by my girlfriend for instance i mean all my because i know it was the most difficult subject in my school so and it's still like that i was just preparing preparing preparing preparing preparing and i yeah it was not so it's difficult for me not to feel stupid about something like that you know to know not be hard on me you know with my with myself um to not be hard on on the fact and all these things in different ways uh because and because yeah maybe the relation with what we were talking before is because uh is the way i try to see things is that i cannot make things better to keep on worrying for something that is problematic for me let's say i know i have a problem in terms of how i plan my things i prepared too much i i do i don't start executing very soon i need big setups i i that's the way i deal with things and so i know the only thing i can do is like i guess try to learn for the next time and better to be more practical but the part of that then yeah it's it will give me problems if i keep on thinking on that you know yeah i see how you feel when when when you encounter yourself with problems let's say with basically with desires now like what you wish and it's not happening you mean like uh so you start thinking about it and it just doesn't help yeah let's think yeah in the work like for instance yesterday how you deal with that like yeah i'm trying to like understand how you why you brought that up because well i i started to get i started to understand what you mean well so i had only like like let's say we had 10 minutes and i start to think like when we started like i was already frustrated because you know i'm not saying that well well of course because you asked a few things so i was explaining and that took time but that was already happened and then you know i was really like because i think it's because i did you know uh my solo already like twice and i knew that i can do so many things if i have like one hour for myself um and then given that i was like shoot like i have 10 minutes and it's just like you know yeah it's it's not fair and it's like i and also like i was explaining to you so i was like like this is not this is not cool but then i think that's one problem and then i started to think that because i only have 10 minutes i have to make something nice that i can put on my instagram for example this is really you know this is like a terrible idea but um i thought about it and then i think i was trying to do it and while i was doing maybe like after five minutes i started to think like why am i thinking like this this is also like that's ridiculous that i'm trying to make something to put on twitter or instagram like that's not the reason why i'm doing it and i don't know how i end up like oh i don't know maybe i realized that after the video it was okay the instagram video was nice yeah yeah it was okay but that was like already i was consciously trying to make something that i can upload maybe i maybe after that maybe uh when it hit 10 pm i we stopped it and then i was like oh my gosh this is like you know i i couldn't do maybe i could only do like 10 percent of what i wanted to do for example and then i started to think like why like what's what's really the point so i think it i didn't really go into that spiral because it was already like performative and yeah like it was i was kind of in the flow or although i was frustrated like i know what i want to do i know i can only do 10 of what i want to do but still like i have to do it and whatever so it's actually not not not a bad um thought that i wanted to do something to put on instagram for example that kind of drove me and anyways whatever i think i think that's what i can do you know like i can also try to understand what you're doing and try to respond with the body but yeah i mean that could be possible too maybe i would have less interesting video or less interesting sound but that could have been done um yeah i don't know what uh what i should have done or but i think it's not bad that maybe every time also like we we should think about putting something on instagram i don't know i i i think that something that if i'm doing like if i'm with you for instance like basically we share space and then because we share the space it's like as if you're in a house no it's like then then and then [\u00a0__\u00a0] happens sometimes and then it's just part of life no this is how i see it that's what i thought after a performance well perform practice like i was like yeah but it's just a part of the game you know it's it's not something like if i want to do something for myself just do it by myself you know it's it's different thing you know a different thing yeah and that's something that i reflect when when i told you when i saw the video and then i thought like oh my god i need to i need to uh i need to stand up my game like because then i then i like when you saw my so you're when you were doing the loan um after that one of the things that i thought is like with that anyway what i because after i was playing as well when we finished yesterday as well i was i'll keep on playing with yeah alone and it was partly when those uh awards came up afterwards um and then is i understood i understood like think that um in that space is the space that i'm with you and actually like when we have this like the conversation for for me are so uh so nutritious like when we have these chats because normally after i i i listen them and not all the time but sometimes i do it completely and then i see things that i cannot see um for because part of my personality or ho ho ho who i am but then when i see it i have a perspective that i can see myself and i can listen to you or i can listen to me as well speaking and then i i can catch things the they are in the in the in the in the air they're on the air which are basically you and me talking in relation to what we are doing yeah and for me like yesterday i was not um explicitly like reacting to what you were doing let's say um but you you were in my background right and i did so when i was doing like i was not i was thinking that okay like i shouldn't care like just do whatever i want do whatever on my appearance in the video or whatever to play with it with hydra but i was already thinking that because you have this you know something red around your body or like i was already seeing that and then i was not trying to respond to it but it was like it also affected my decision of how to change my appearance which maybe it's really little but still it was there i i totally remember that i was looking at you and i was maybe not doing anything with your image but i was it was part of something the whole you know landscape or whatever and that was really interesting to to to think back so actually yeah because i was just going back like to what like the last because we spent the last time we talked quite quite a lot about this in the tools about the tools and the messages and then yeah it's like i don't know i think that's like so it's very complicated but for instance what we talk when we speak about the message of yeah then it could be because we have so many elements right because we have have the space we have um the because there is there is my computer there is my computer there is your computer and you're sending me your images so there is the there are so many elements from where you can construct something or deconstruct something that speaking about message like for instance when when you said just before that even though you are not reacting to my motion let's say uh consciously then in somehow as well because it was so fast it's like 10 minutes and somehow you have to let past so many information about what is happening but at the same time then you will decide that there are some things that will be in relation to that reddish thing that is passing which is me actually um there so you you have the conscious there is somehow there is yeah there is me um but because of the of the time frame or just because what it was happening then you don't really have the time to think and develop and to create a message i don't know it's just you do you you create something that in yeah i don't know how how i can reframe this like i don't i think what we speak about message or when i speak about message it's it's getting more clear than is could be anything basically it could be could be could be could be that your experience could be could be the elements there are like for instance even at the beginning you know like even at the beginning when you talk to me like are and those are things that we are not doing consciously but i think when i see that the idea of the message in my head i think it's getting more into when in some how you take decisions you know when when when somehow i take decisions for some reason and for something to happen right um the knowledge that makes sense for you or what do you think what um yeah i'm trying to not trying to understand but more like kind of uh connect bits and pieces um but what i'm really interested is yeah like what is really the message about like not i think what's interesting is not really the message itself the content of the message but like why message what for how is about this message right it's not like because it's really personal and right now we're not showing to anyone as you know life and it's not really a performance and it is a practice but yeah but that was something for me like that this time like the last time we were talking i was kind of like referring about the message as something that it has to take a shape uh in somehow somehow but now after this experience as well and while we're talking it's it's getting more clear there is something that is something that yeah yeah and i don't know if this is like lead to message but definitely like what we did yesterday was different from my solo because maybe what i was doing is the same maybe but but but not you know like it's what was happening inside and also how maybe it was a frustration or maybe it was a surprise that came into during this session together and this would be more interesting as a message because if i'm doing the solo then maybe i'll try to make it perfect in a way like you know because yeah i've already stuck with the tools and let's say tool meaning you know this one hour slope as well like okay i have one hour i have hydra tidal cycles and these different samples i took from rihanna and then yeah i hear that i could i have more of it i could use so those things and my movement and this is like interesting but it's just about the content right and maybe i can be better at this maybe i can express whatever but it's not really i think it's not what i'm interested in like this is okay like this is interesting to me for me to practice and find perfection or some kind of whatever using image to express myself but these these are the only questions that comes after the so like solo practice and there's nothing more than just finding perfection or finding myself and i think that's what is actually not so interesting at least to me that if we do it together the different things happen is maybe frustrating or but but that's something to cope with and some or maybe not to cope with something to live with yeah and but after all what what is this but but we're not like trying to find like you know doing things in tandem and doing like perfect uh life coding performance together like we're not trying to do this i think that's something interesting something that i was thinking yesterday that i thought because i was moving i was moving fast it was the first time i was moving fast so then when i see my recording on yours then i see like wow is i think that it might be interesting as well to think um if for instance like how much like for instance like what if there is not too much delay you know what if there is what if what if there is more because yeah that's for something that is is coming is coming from me like uh close to this idea of the content or uh yeah the content or the tools that in somehow our basics you know is like or to question you know because i'm not saying that we need to have like the no latency little no less latency as possible what i'm saying just is that will be interesting to try in almost like real time what happens you know like well you still because then it's just something something else will appear then we don't know and when i was watching the video yesterday i could see that like um yeah and that's actually more because in terms of uh dance you know like i fee i feel slowly like from above slowly i feel that is more like that the dance is wanted to come like to do more things like the dance like uh which i think is very nice because in my in my experience with this is like i i almost didn't want it to move because it this is that that's me first like then is you thinking about instagram and then it's like me thinking that i know mo i know movements i know like i'm a dancer you know i study that so then it would be me i don't move because i will search perfection uh and then it's me with my own with my own logic trying to this is my me getting in this in the spiral in this vertex vortex because then i bet then it's basically that's why i don't move that much because i try to not get crazy because that will drive me crazy and then what i think is beautiful is that it's slowly and i feel like from path i start moving with as when i start dancing i guess then then it's just like i start like yesterday was because we have just 10 minutes so i have just to move and it was just like it's so so much joy of dance right and i think that's that's something that i feel this was more coming that uh like the dancing is wanted to say want to say what want to say things i think is yeah it's is more than one to do thing it wants to say things regardless of what is coming out of it which is wonderful because then you can relate to this idea of when martin talks about like because then actually then you are being then i'm being hacked by my own my then the dancing is hacking my own mind and body and just i'm just there and then it's pure then it's dance performing for yeah uh yeah yeah so you see yeah yeah i well now i forgot what i wanted to comment on because yeah because this pure dance thing this is also interesting but there's something i wanted to comment on what did you say before that it's a weird question um i was talking about like i had the latency the oh yeah exactly so this is like really interesting question because i try to you know change setup a little bit like you know every time i try to improve it maybe it's just about the volume maybe it's you know somehow improve the frame rate of the recording and i i do it a lot because i try i really want to optimize it so that um like the last time i was sending the sound to your end but what i really noticed is that of course hydra performs much better if i don't have the the video conference like video call like if i'm doing alone then hydra works much better because there's no live lab or gt or zoom that's sending data and that slows down on my computer it's just a you know tablet pc whatever that's really not like a high-end computer so that's uh something like i when i was doing alone with the hydra it was somewhat better and it was fun that i see myself dancing on the screen you know um but then yeah then here comes the question like when we do it together because of the computer because the network it's uh slow the frame rate is really bad um yeah like is that something that i think it's interesting like when we come together in frankfurt we should do something together i mean try to find you know ways to work together so that it's like because we still need to find a way to not see each other that would be so weird yeah it'll be so weird to see yeah yeah but uh but then yeah but that yeah could be nice like we we could find maybe we can ask there to the organization time to go to to be in to be in a studio like to have to move a bit you know to move um yeah to move to move a bit um yeah what if we do it in a forest or something i don't know um i know it's just interesting yeah that works but the thing is like i mean that's actually will be very interesting as well i will take with me some things like some small things that i can carry um but then it's like because i think um i mean a part of like i think it's because a part of like physically then do something a part of the a part of the electronics you know just physically do moving uh that definitely i think we should do uh i think as part as part of the practice for instance i will see as part of the practice if we go to to a forest and then we move there but then it then something has to be something uh some interface has has to be there i think so when we talk uh uh because i think this part when we talk about this best practices i see like the that we are somehow what we are doing seems to me as far as whether my research hawaii i think i see myself more doing is like working towards like ontology uh ontology of interfaces you know then and and the the relation between the human so we and the digital interfaces and how they cannot exist without each other meaning in the best practices like if the the the best like say the computer will not exist if you or me are not there if the computer will just be there but at the same time in for the best practices i'm not existing if i am not there so the relation between like this me being the man like the power you know the person who knows to control the computer is is uh is erased in a way like you are i'm the i'm dependent uh my existence for the best practices is depending as in the same relation it's horizontal to the to the computation the the computer towards me like we both are depending for the for existence so this ontological question i found in very i don't know where is what is going but i think what we do basically it has to be a lot with that it's like we're dealing with ourselves that's what we have to talk personally some about things uh but at the same time then we talk about the nature of the computer and that's what we do about talking uh how is going with work and these kind of things is the nature is the being the nature of the of what we do and because of that i think it will be we have that i see like i would like to do in the forest but then there is we have to i see that what can we use you know like what what we can still what can still be an interface it could be maybe just the facebook that i was doing i was thinking because i was doing with this puff i remember and with facebook i remember i was doing something like that um yeah something i see but definitely definitely would be super super cool yeah you know like when i said forest it's not about you know just being there and doing something but like well i don't know if we bring computers to the forest and do it separately in a separate space but that's different you know that's not what i meant yeah um because that's just translating our space into somewhere else not my room but it's in the forest um but then from that perspective what i'm saying sorry is that it's just the interface that in that in that case is the computer it has to try to be translated into something and so let's say uh i see that's what i mean with the interface the interface could be as well a camera you know could be does it have to be my macbook pro uh doesn't have to be something just we have but that's what i that's what i was trying to introduce this idea of like the the ontology of the of the interfaces when then we define what are those for us right yeah yeah i i agree like for example i mean i i'm not meaning i don't i don't mean to you know understand that in a really technical sense but for example if we have a phone and then we connect to jitsi and there's another computer that's recording jitsi then we can do that you know we can just be there together and move it and move and then we have a recording there um that's very technical sense but uh yeah i think it's something that yeah it's it's not about us being the same space and moving together but like how yeah like having keeping this constraint of networked uh or interfaced and but doing it in a different space yeah i will say condition i would say more than because yeah but because i don't know what you refer with network because i will set more than the network itself i will set the interface because the network will always it then it will demand us to being connected somehow and while we could see i mean like while i mean we can as well like uh uh break down what does it mean the network for instance like does it means like do we have to be connected to the internet necessarily for being in a network that could be part of like how we could deconstruct like the understanding of what is the network could be like the the the forest for it is a network of no uh yeah so but then i think for as well practical reasons um and could be good could be a good exercise is then we don't need uh i mean that is not necessary we don't need to be connected to uh uh to the same uh to an internet let's say like uh we could that's what i said like then that's what i just introduced it as an as an interface whatever that we define as interfaces um yeah yeah yeah i i think i understand i mean like yeah network was i mean because i didn't say internet network in a you know broader sense and yeah yeah yeah yeah that's what yeah it could be yeah it could be like something else that i don't know i cannot come up with a good example how we can be connected in a more like a primitive way i don't know if we use smoke or something to communicate but um but maybe that's something we can do or um i don't know maybe you can have a phone call and just transfer the sound or is it so cool it could be so cool like for instance maybe we should really try to do that like like for instance like what i think just in in a space like let's say in the same space so then we do our best practices like so still so basically we have just paper and colors and then we try to do kind of uh our best practices just with paper and colors and and we record a session uh once we once we are together so basically like i have i kind of like draw i i just represent like my screen somehow and then just start drawing you and or me and then we can just exchange papers you know as if i will send you the my image you know like basically just do the same thing but in paper and that could be interesting actually as an exercise uh if you see what i mean but do you mean like something representative or can be anything on the paper no i mean yeah i'm really bad drawing i cannot think that it's just there's something like that that it will just there will just be i think because yeah i think it does think in that sense for instance then we will be really close to like playing uh back and forward between the content that is very well defined uh paper and colors and then exchanging sheets of paper between you and me like that's basically a screen that i send it to you you send me something and then like that and then the message because in somehow and then i think it's nice they said because then is i don't think yeah i think consciously or unconscious you will be trying to or represent me in the drawing or represent i don't know something in the drawing and then sometimes you have to just let it go and so i think because yeah i think that's the the key of what i'm trying to say because of the speed of what of that practice is very slow let's say if you compare with computers then you're really actually uh then you could see almost a thing if we record like when you are when we are in a more like trying to do messages or where we are more working with the content uh because of the speed because it's so it's slow i see and as well because we don't i mean i'm not drawing i'm really bad at drawing this is and yeah yeah it's just it's just not natural but i think it's it's something like also related to what we talked about you know the frame rate and what we what if we have like better connection for example um yeah because that you know that might not be necessary or actually we're not like we might be able to communicate better with pen and paper for example and that is possible you know like because you will be more um concentrated on what you draw or what each other have drawn and that might that you know if we draw maybe it's it transfers more like better idea than actually sending the screen share of hydra for example but don't you think for instance try to be like try to think like because while you were speaking i was like really imagining because then you said like yeah i draw and then i give you a piece of paper if you try to imagine actually if you give me a piece of paper with your drawings it's almost for me and a bet i mean it will be very difficult for me to not try to make a sense of what you're giving me in that from that point of view than the message i mean then somehow like it would be very difficult for me to not that's the way how it works no it's that the communication is super clear because of the speed no you give me this is the paper and and somehow i will make yeah that the way ho or brain works no i will make my assumptions of course yeah yeah and i think to as a not a conclusion but uh what's interesting is not really about i mean the content of what you draw or what i draw or you draw is probably that's one thing to be that's that's interesting but if we think further like yeah why is it working how this process happened can we do it over network i mean over the internet or we don't do it over the internet these questions becomes more become more interesting i think yeah that would be so cool like just like like to do something like that and then then after that you do it in the computer you know then of course we're not the same anymore no no no but it's like it's very similar to how you do exercises while in dance now when you actually you limited let's say you limit the space of somebody of two meters and then you have to improvise for five minutes and then after right after that then you have the whole thing meters uh it's exactly the same because of the content basically because of the constraints no you define very limited uh spaces where things are very clear in order for you to free you afterwards yeah yeah it's not like it's kind of like i don't know it feels like when you have like dogs like fighting dogs and you're kind of like pulling them you know like then it's like you're more like just you're exciting them and they just let them go you know let them the horses run um i see but uh what i wanted to say um but i think this is really interesting topic because last time you talked about tools and should we like find a set of tools that we always always use but this question of changing the let's say the constraints that's i mean i i'm not i'm saying that in the sense that they don't conflict but it could be interesting if we define clear clearly what are the constraints what are the variables in the constraints we can change and like with regard to the tools are we changing tool every time based on constraints or do we try to you know have same tools as much as possible i mean we don't have to stick to one thing i think we can just you know uh change it but then we have to be really conscious about what the decisions we make i like this idea i mean what you said because in somehow you're changing this that's my understanding of translation of what you said is that because instead of like speaking about tools it's more about constraints and then because if you set up all tools it's like okay now jorge you're gonna use just hydra you can use just one screen and you can use just one speaker and just one um a loop rihanna song and and so instead of that then i i like this idea when you when when we refer then instead of the constraints because then could be something that is more abstract than you say sure uh yeah then we just define and could be so many different constraints i mean and that for itself is gonna be very tricky you know because then we both have to because because what we're proposing is just something that is very uh uh as i understand like that constraints they are very well defined that for you for me but at the same time that they are malleable like that they allow to take different shapes while they still are constraints well defined for you and for me that we both understand um and i think that will be very tricky because then we have to agree in something that is it's not that we are talking about is hydra you know or a computer is a computer but then we talk about constraints and then we define what are the constraints that we want uh and then if i talk about speed then something might it might be speeding my head and something is different for you and your in your in your head i i i really like this idea that like i'm putting in my nose like i like to refer more instead of talking about the tools to talk about the constraints yeah i think that i think that's something i wanted to you know that was i had in mind last time but i couldn't really find that uh what's what's the right uh concept or concept idea i love it and i go because it's really computer related it's like variables right yeah yeah sure i really like it okay maybe we should close here i i really like this constraint uh so i stopped the recording yes", "QYcMDm5nZNY": "yeah um so if you want me we can record it and then yeah it started okay right and so um so what i'm saying is like if you have a project like where they it's a technological project you know the base is uh choreography where the one of the main subjects of the production is the technology then are you still there because they froze yep okay um so since the technology is one of the main subjects is the technology a part of the dancers and then the choreographer which is the let's say the main direct director you know like the one who is in charge of the artistic direction and the total direction in a way of the project then there is a lot of miscommunication or there's a lot of effort that has to be translated that's that's basically between the desires of the choreographer which uh comes with uh not only i will say the standards but just the the nature of choreography is normally is very specific if you if you study choreography of dance for many years then normally you work very is frame between space and time let's say um and and then in plus on top of the space and time that you are very uh trained as choreographer and as a dancer then you want this uh specificity of the of the dance of the choreographic aspects to be translated into something this that is technological you know you know maybe let me try to reframe it is like you're as a choreographer then you will try to translate poetics into something that is technological and that's very costly in terms of production because then since she cannot handle the whole thing by herself let's say if you will be the choreographer just me and my dancers then my abstraction in my wishes uh they since it's like human to human with something that is dense then it takes less time until i can re uh make uh feasible uh or possible these things that i want as choreographer uh will be the last time we did answers because because we talk anyway about abstraction or poetics that comes from my head as choreographer right but when this subject let's say is when we talk about technology or robots in this case and the robots by itself they have let's say if it's this ball that moves then you need first you as a developer or uh or a person in charge of the technology you need to understand you need to first understand what is the world inside of of that ball how that ball can move uh and that just just that process will take a long time just by nature it's just normal yeah and then so then you have this process normal and then the other one is the choreographic aspect and there's a director and then the poetics that are being trying to translate it takes way longer than what is the between the choreographer and the dancer than the choreographer and the robot because it's basically about abstractions in poetics have you seen works from rhizomatics maybe you can send me a link uh yeah i mean it's not like uh it's not just put the name just put the name and then i'll just look it up afterwards yeah uh i'll i'll send it to you later but i just open search tab so i will remember no because i uh yeah this is recorded so i shouldn't say bad things too much but i i gave this example because um i gave this example because they work with they are let's say like a media like design studio or whatever like they work with technology and makes like a media um facade or stage you know design for um concerts and stuff like that like you know with lights and uh displays it's it's really in that sense that they are really doing something um conventional but also like i mean they're also interested in like more like research aspects with uh ai and um vr like something that's more experimental and which is quite interesting but like they often work with dancers they always work with the same dancers uh from uh they're from japan and also they work with the dancers from japan and i would say like their choreography is always very harmless like it's very conservative that uh like for example they work with projections or like lasers or drones like robot arms all these things but they kind of skips like what you explained for you know like understanding the technology or like choreographic aspects like they kind of bypass all these things and make everything super simple so that they don't really have um conflict with the dancers and technology well they must have something some struggles working on these things but uh yeah i just wanted to say this because uh if you look at the pieces it's really um not touching like it's really like uh showing the technology through the dance piece but the dance itself is really not telling you anything that kind of thing um but i think that's like one thing one less interesting way of working with it but but i totally understand because then if you have to like deliver messages like to be really deep into you know concepts between the technology and movements then it will take ages to really you know work with this subject it's just like it takes time and if you just keep up with like new technologies it's just like impossible you know yeah yeah but i think you i think you touch uh um a topic that i think is interesting maybe to to come to to come back there is this idea of uh you said uh deliver message you know that's like this is going back to what we said uh this idea of the of the uh of the context content and the message is this once you're trying to deliver a message um then because then the nature of the of the subjects all the stakeholders in the project they have their own nature and then if you work with technology then depends which technology are you using it has its own constraints which are no humans it's just starting from that point and and it's just it it has this feeling as you described where you can see production they that they look good let's say that they can form and they can present something that is that you can see as one thing that it looks good and it's it's it's nice but it doesn't transcend or going somewhere as a message or you have the other way around which is like when people then people are trying to then work in poetics or in delivering a message then it's a mess no because i think and i think it's not i think it's because those processes i think they just need way more time you know you need just to chill the up and then just work um yeah uh i think a good example is for instance like maybe and then we can go start like going to i was watching a part of like your first video for instance and then when you're there alone and then then i i see that for instance that there is some of the things that they for me gets clear is that then when i see you then i see you then sometimes a part of when there is a flow when we define a flow then then you have these different interactions um they are are you dancing on the music are you dancing uh on the on the visuals uh i think that's that's i mean and then you can go in more inner layers but i think basically then then i could see like sometimes like are you are you dancing on what you hear or are you hearing and then or are you dancing for what you're seeing yeah because i think uh i think one of the things i couldn't i couldn't watch completely the second part which i i i watched the last few minutes of this of your or your last session and that was super colorful and there was a lot of passion let's say it seems like a lot of things going on there like it looks like like uh yeah i like was like really crazy you know because then the way how the visuals were made like you are out in out in out with the chroma and the colors you just like right super i think i made it like i disappear sometimes with the sound something like that yeah yeah yeah yeah so whatever what i think is is that um i think like because we are talking about message you know and then when you talk about messaging means like communication and communication is based in uh and two person into in in something that is the any uh the the thing or the subject that it needs a message and the other one who received the message right and in that sense for instance when we work when when there is you and me then regardless of how interesting is the final product let's say the visuals if we just the focus is the visuals regardless of how interesting are the visuals is that you can see that there is more [Music] yeah there's communication because like sometimes because then you have to wait for what i'm doing something what i have to i have to wait when you do something and because there is no i cannot control what you want to do i have to just wait and and handle all these things within my desires and this part of the things that we were saying before the last session you know the things that i i want i want to create in my let's say my composition that is very conscious no and and then there is a there is a clear dialogue between there is another person you know there's another person who is listening to me and who is sending something to me and then when you are alone then is it certainly is different because i think i still i was thinking it's a practice because then it's like you could be practicing with yourself so he's it's par i was thinking it i was thinking at some point is this a best practice you know i was thinking is is this a best practice and what one could say like are you you're practicing with with things that you like you know and then that's so it's a practice and then what makes it more tricky is that is because there is no clear definition of who is uh what is the what is the receptor then sometimes it gets um or it gets super boring the there's more i think in the in the in the first video like the it takes really long until ramps up or there are just chunks when there's something happening uh or like if i see the second video the last part when there's completely massive mayhem and then there is just some all this uh fire like like power ranger thing like i see like powers like going there and it's like super super uh super colorful and super cool actually it looks really good um but then then again if there is and then we talk about the message is super convoluted right because there is uh let's say me and i and i know what is the framework because i work with you uh then i get confused i get confused a lot in in in the in the sense of in the message let's say even though there is not a narrative i get confused in the that was the question like are you are you are you moving on the on the sound is the sound moving you are you moving on the of the visual is the visual moving you and that's very interesting like to think that because it makes me as well imagine because i don't know what are you doing just i have to make sense of what you do so you're trying to follow what i was kind of thinking or like what was my yeah of course yeah and actually what is cool as well is because then i'm following as well you're coding and it actually i like that idea because there is there is a a timeline with the coding like with the hydra there is a timeline there is that evolves and it's always gone from zero to hundred percent in the two sessions you know you start like and then just you type a little bit and then you tap a little bit more you tap a little bit more until so it it is it's like a ballet you know it's just stars and it finishes there is a narrative with the coding that i can follow i see i can follow i can for following the codes out okay now you're saturating not zero percent that you're gray but now you are saturating three percent that's why i see more colors you know um yeah and some of those things i think are cool because then then you don't need to know too much about coding just you need to know a little bit of yeah a little bit of some background of something similar and then you will start making sense of it because there is a it is mo it moves you know it advances the code will evolve and then you will see okay that means red that means this and as well as clear something it says saturation it says uh yeah yeah like i yeah like you said it's really convoluted and um really hard to like like you know like i don't know where to start really because also about the coding itself like i have some i started to think a lot about like what is coding for me and what is this practice like best practice in coding for example because this is like um this is also this is i had this in mind while i was doing this session by myself like for example like i decided not to save the the code while i'm you know performing sort of say or practicing because it's something that like it builds up during the you know while encoding like you said you know it's like a timeline that you know adds up and creates something and also like i yeah i consciously don't save it or recreate what i did in the past i mean of course i need to copy some of the parts for chroma key and stuff but um more like you know adding colors and things because the coding itself is like something made to be productive like you know what do you mean with that what do you mean with that like like the nature of coding is you know it's really industrial and it's you know something that it has to be perfect you know you don't want the bug and you also want to save it every single time because you know you don't want to lose anything and it's it's just made for perfection and although you know always there's a bug um it's it's about the productivity and i started to think like what is really also this name creative coding that people say and after watching some martin's videos you know what is really creativity because like how he frames it is like they give you the structure or the frame where you can be creative but it's within the possibility right it's not great to create it's not like about doing something outside that frame but so given that what creative coding means is like for example if you have processing you do something with processing and you just end up doing something inside processing or inside touch designer or whatever tool that you're using which is also you know i mean it's not i'm not saying it's boring but uh i started to think like what's what is if there's another way to do that and i think light coding is something um i mean i'm of course i'm still stuck inside hydra or tidal cycles for the sound but um well i don't know where i'm trying to go but uh why did i say creative coding um anyways i think i i think i'm trying to not to think that as creative and also i think productive and creatives kind of have something similar i don't know maybe i'm mixing up some other some different things because i'm kind of um confused these days but um but i think i think it's i mean the way i see it is that you start i start thinking on this now that what what does it mean that what does it mean uh to what you said like best practice then we said like okay then you practice no then you practice something and then i think then um i think we're in a good path in terms of like i mean i i will say more than i think eventually we should uh find what are the things that we want to practice right you know then we've defined better better that i think that i introduced that this idea the last time that we talked you know then when we talk about like me projecting in the chapel when there are more elements um and in terms of the the elements all these elements that get convoluted and so convoluted until the point that that is just really out of the hand or of our hands which is okay and uh i guess at some points but i think eventually we would like what i would like to set we are practicing more or less this framework you know and eventually but i said eventually because it's not my it's not my intention right now because i i feel if i frame myself too much i mean we need some minimum of frame you know like it's not the next time i see you then i will start it i don't know like i start doing completely oh something out of the blue because i just think it's nice maybe i just started using that a ball robot in front of in facebook chat and just like yeah let's try to practice this because i have one robot now here so um but i think my intention at this moment is more than this the intention of what we're working is still like to free ourselves you know like to have a good time and because of that uh then it's then i feel that we are close to what a child does you know in in in terms of like just learning to learning to walk and learning to see what is around its world no um that's what i'm i'm thinking that eventually i think uh then we should say like we'll be cool you know this we said like this practice then we define these these tools and just these tools and then we have to work on that and eventually uh but well i didn't feel it i don't know um i i follow what you mean um but it's kind of like for me as i said it's something about like how do we go how can we go beyond the frame of like let's say coding and but that that doesn't necessarily conflict with what you said because i think it's like um it's like uh well i think it's like what he was saying but basically like i need kind of frame so that i can go outside the frame because yeah i cannot just say that okay i'll i do whatever that's like kind of you know but like for example then i need hydra to do something beyond hydra let's say and that's kind of interesting but i don't know if that frame like for example like to be concrete like should we say that we always use hydra and tidal cycles for the sound or is it something else that if there's other way to like frame something because i i have i have a feeling of this as well because i thought one of the the first like one of the first things that i thought when i saw like more the last like the second thing what you made because it was so rich the visual looks really good then i feel in a way threat i i feel that threat i feel like oh my god i didn't i didn't practice you know then you have an advantage with me and then so then i that was the first thought that i have it's like i was feeling threat because i didn't practice and because then you have some more you're more comfortable with hydra and then i thought oh no maybe i should just practice by myself and then just i need to level i need to level up and then i think i have two two thoughts about uh around the idea one is like um yes i guess in as with anything then it's better if you know more but yeah so there's one thing but i think in terms of for what we're doing it make no sense to me because that was my own assumption it made no sense to me to start a competition with you you know like what is it what is the point of that and and because of that then i was saying uh then then is like for instance because then is the framework that we just we define at this point is like we have hydra and some some things that we usually work with then it's like if at some point uh is the the tool is getting uh too common to you let's say it or to me then is i think it's up to there's two two ideas then one is like i think it's my responsibility to uh and then i think it in terms of dance as well because in dances well i have it happened the same to me then it's like how i can make something that's what you were saying you know how can i within the frame i can get out of the frame and that's because that that limitation is what actually will free me um yeah um so um yeah because basically otherwise we we enter but i think it's okay as well i think then we then we start entering uh a discussion about tools and then we get out of the practice and that's what i was referring and that's what i'm trying to say in the beginning of the chat when i said that is not my interested i'm not interested right now in in in defining too much you know even though we have to define some minimums uh i and then i said like eventually i would like we to define more frameworks uh but but then not right now because otherwise that we end up doing or talking about tools and that's what is the nature of engineering that is that that's what that was normally actually is the problem when you as a choreographer try to work with technology and uh because you have a tool you have that you have the tool let's say you have the robot that you have to move and there is just so much that you need to know to make that robot move from side to side there's so much you need to know about just the the robot and then the network and then the whole thing and a part of them that you have to translate the message from the choreographer so there's too much in that so just the tool is way it's just a world in itself and i think what we're trying to define here when we work with the best practices as i i think more is uh not talking too much about the tools because that's what you do i think that's what it happens in the choreography coding lab you know then you talk too much about or that you try to create tools and like at some point we were talking like maybe we need to create maybe peacemaker is not working for us maybe we need to work maybe we need to create it and that's okay if it at some point we end up there and but i think uh i still we i think still we are evolving in what we're doing and not putting the the the point on the tool it's i that's how i feel i don't know how you you think about what do you think about this idea of the how you see the tools it's i mean i what i well first of all i think we're doing we are seeing this from like very different perspectives um i'm not trying to make it complicated but uh for me um it's hard to say but i think what i just thought about was tool like if you use a tool you don't have to understand the tool right like you have to know how to use it in your way and it doesn't matter like how the tool is made like especially for like programming for example like you don't have to know java and all you know this uh how cpu works yeah yeah to use the processing but uh you know so that's something like if you're if you're working with a robot then like you don't have to necessarily know everything about arduino and how you know motors are controlled and you don't need that but i mean but robot is very probably not a good example because it's it's very hard to make it black box because you know in this low-level um engineering part it's kind of connected anyways so but for example like for visuals like you don't have to know understand like how gpu works but still you can make you know just connect things and something works and then you kind of start to make your own practice within that tool and i think that's more interesting to me yeah i think i didn't completely understood if you can't refrain i think i did not like what you said you said is like then if we talk about name visuals then it's not necessary to to know everything about the low level yeah the black box of two and you just like you know try something and accidentally something happens and then with time you start to you know build your own practice and um yeah but but yeah sorry yeah i think what i was trying to say because i'm trying to bring the discussion into this that we start talking that was the when we talk about the choreographer and the message and uh is because regardless that's how i feel the regardless the tool uh that i decide to use is more important actually my process toward the message even though it's not clear or there is not a narrative that starts and end at some point but there is a iterative process in which i'm developing more or less like for instance in that case i need you i need you to to give me to to send to give me feedback to give me to send me your visuals um to keep on going with my my own uh trying on the message so uh yeah so then how i feel with them with the tools is that regardless of the tools that we choose is is uh then is important than what we are trying to do within the message [Music] does that make sense sorry i no i didn't get it yeah no i think basically it's just this idea that yeah i think that's why i feel that that regardless that that regardless the tool is the message what i'm aiming for yeah um but what is the messaging okay yeah that's what we have but that's what we have to define that's that's very important that's what is very important to your question because i am there i am there but because of that then i need you there um and that's what i found is very very interesting that this frame this framework that you propose and when you start like doing the when you do a solo for instance you know because then when when i see you doing the solo then i will i will do it i will try to do it in my time then then just there i can see um [Music] some things that how to explain that because when you're alone then it's not there is there is not this waiting time in this assumption of what is happening there in the other side i don't know if there is delay i don't know if i should wait because maybe i see a patron that i i think i might use but i don't know if it will evolve in the way who i want it um all these things in terms of my desires of of me uh it just takes in terms of dynamics uh is is more uh let's say it's more natural it's natural because there's a conversation there and then i have to deal with my own desires because then you are the other side and there's delay and there's all these constraints the tools and then i found a super reach and then what i think is very linked to closing what i'm trying to say is that uh then because because of that then i think is very important that we talk and try to define what is the message because maybe there is no message while we any uh they just we have to define what is the message it's not maybe it's not that we are trying to say like save the world don't uh use uh plastic or something or is that what we want to say you know like uh or do we like rihanna oh like but like those things are very clear yeah well maybe rihanna is actually yeah i mean i mean not saying like make fun of it but it's really clear that you know i think i think i think it's really like what martin was trying was you know that you know people like it and you just put it there because people like well not because people like it but you know it's it's really clear that i don't know if that's really the message or anything but you know it's something that we find agreement in a way agreement i don't know yeah yeah yeah no but no but completely and i think it's because there is this this comes from this uh is minimal in under it's the same way how it goes communication and the last time we were talking that we were talking of the same like for you to understand my language you need to know about english you know then you can recognize the the message within the words right so it's the same like then if you put it more abstract or into something like if you say like about rihanna and then you put a kitchen song it's because people will fast like catch what is it you know they don't need to go and try to put so many under under layers it's just something you can just jump in or just back up back off true um yeah well that's one thing and about the message or more about the conversation like i was like while i was doing my solo i have to say it was really fun but also like i always have this problem that um like to be honest i always want to work alone because i always have problems with you know communication and but then how i see now like i i work with you and also i work with ian sue in montreal and we do like different kind of practice but it's like it on the you know um like it's also like online and we do something together and what i think is i start to think like this is not like i'm i still feel that i want to work alone but it's more about i find uh way that suits me like how i can work i can feel comfortable working because for example i don't i never felt comfortable in a dance studio or art studio to work there because i don't know how to do it i although i spent some time in like in a dance studio but like i still feel like even when you're alone i'm when i'm alone and when you're alone if i'm just taking workshop for example that's okay and but then if i want to do something if i want to create my own work in a dance studio alone or with someone i just don't know what to do because it's well one i it's not like something i'm trained to do but also like i think i i think um it might not be the the best way to work for me and while we're doing this uh best practice this practices i start to feel like well maybe this is not exactly the way i want to work but it's it's really a challenge to find my own studio or quote unquote because it's not a studio but let's say like workplace or where things are created and i mean of course we're doing it together but it's also really personal um process because i'm here alone and we have kind of separation i mean physically so this is something i started to think and within that frame it's fine for me to work with someone else because it's it's more about the the con context or content i don't know i don't know if at that point but um so this is something and this this is something i started to think and then if i do my solo it's fine it was fun like especially the second one was really fun but then i i start to feel i'm not sure if i want to continue this like if i'm just like want to have fun i think it's fine but then if i just do it every day probably it's not what i'm looking for because then i start to get lost like because there's no conversation and like there's no message basically and maybe it's pure form of dance or some kind of expression with the technology but i i get i i'm not so interested in that yeah i think i think it's very very very it makes sense the things that you said and what you talk about is is is is it's very interesting because you said about it i mean and just because often what i'm when i'm start doing is because it's the way who i see actually uh or collaboration that i see that is growing because then i see as well then how i can practice things that i know for instance um and then when you talk first and then i'm then often i'm putting this in translating that into dance like hold on works in my head with dance and then i can see myself as well like alone in the studio then when let's say if i dance alone and then i then sometimes have a good session by myself and then school i certainly i wouldn't i could not extend that as a practice you know like every week by myself doing it because i will burn myself with my own content in in terms of uh my dance skills even though even though uh i will enjoy very much some sessions i will burn myself because then i have no feedback and there is this weird with myself and that's something that that i learned in on the way and with compositional tools improvisation then from dancers that they can do a lot of uh amazing stuff you know like a lot of with people who do hip hop and these kind of things and then do acrobatics and stuff like that when somebody is dancing alone in front of 20 people who are dancers who are there to uh posit uh do constructive criticism on your work then you see it as a constant you know then if you have to dance for 15 minutes let's say you have a report you know of tricks that after two minutes you will burn and the only thing how you can survive is using your gaze basically and just being in the moment and basically uh it's a stop that's that's a trick that that's something that i learned under the weight like and you stop you know then when it makes a huge difference then when the when you stop dancing you know and then you take the time to not move and then just to feel what is happening as human you know and and but it's a super difficult thing because then you have to be you with yourself and there is no place to go you know it's just you and the things that are cool and and yeah it's just it's you with yourself and i completely relate with the things that you said and and and then i think that going back to this idea when when when when i feel um that i feel it in a disadvantage let's say because then you know more about hydrate or than me or more coding than me and then there was the first thing that i thought when i saw that and it looked so good and then after in time with more hours and then i felt like but that's not the point you know like if what i'm doing with you is competing with you it's like one could be like yeah that could be one reason to do it but that might be more interesting is like then find within me what is that i can do within the framework to maybe maybe challenge you you know because i can chat i could i could challenge you if i compete in you with you right then then then you have to step up and then you have to stand up but if [Music] if i find within my own means how can i challenge you as partner and then he's more rich that then i think is more playful than just competing with you you know this feels a little bit like detour and um this you know uh competition but i i think i wanted to say something about uh oh yeah like when we were doing together it feels like also it's a conversation but it's also really extremely personal because when i watch your video like you know it's like we're not doing anything together in a way like we're just doing something like we receive something i receive something from you and you receive something from me but it's part of the content let's say and we're not like trying to make something together which is also really interesting thing and that's true um but okay so that's something i want to say and for the competition part i i feel like this is really interesting thing i found was i feel like coding like more productive way of coding like i i maybe i can take a moment or while you're no yeah so he knows yeah because what you said was good yeah yeah so yeah and we can come back to that but for a competition part i feel this uh coding you know like people make tools and make it open source upload it so that people can use it right it's like this is kind of the one of the culture of um let's say creative coding i although i don't like the name and i think this is really interesting that like hip-hop like they also inspire each other and kind of it's not like but you don't really steal it you can steal something but then people will know it and you have to like do it in a i don't know what's the right way how how you you know um take uh techniques from others and make it into your own technique i don't know exactly how this works but i feel this is like a little bit like a similarity between how creative coders do it and uh how it works in hip-hop i don't know maybe i'm just making up no but i think it makes sense but this is i think again this is not what i want to do like also because this is extremely productive side of coding that you save everything and you make it public and you help each other it's good but i'm not going to that direction because that is what makes it coding and i think i have to question that in order to go outside this which i start to think it's like a post coding although it's kind of i i think it's too early but i i think i we need post coding but that's yeah i i see what you mean with that yeah yeah yeah that is true no it i i think it's very it's very uh there is an analogy when you talk about the hip-hop and then when you talk like the nature of code and yeah basically just you you you you just copy paste many times think that other people cried and then just you make it yourself like through some iterative process but is the way how it goes no [Music] and then when you see like when they're more creative coding then you see that there is this aim to to it's very productive it's true now like there's this product is is aimed to to make something you know and it actually ramps up which is yes then um that's what i think is interesting what i would like to i think is i see like that when when i work with you then i can i can see then we have peaks you know that we have peaks yeah when when we work together and then i see we have pigs when they say visually there are things happening and then destroyed and then happening and then destroyed you know and from that point of view then the poetics arrived rises in there regardless of if they are the best thing ever there are peaks and then if you go then back to the creative coating if you think in this in the credit card live coding parties and these kind of things it's just ramp it up it's like the way how you actually in in your two solos you ramp it up uh there isn't there is is because and it's the same how a dancer will do with the tricks and the hip-hop because there is this the space to just stop the dance it's not something somebody will teach you you have to find it by yourself and i guess just it's not in the nature of code like just stop now and and you know if you think in the live parties it just it will be weird and somebody just stopped and so this this idea of the peaks it's something that i i see that we have and although i completely as well agree with you and i wasn't thinking of that in terms of like although we work with the feedback from each other then we're still working within more a content and that is aiming that is trying sometimes with peaks to try to say something but it just breaks down and it's sometimes sometimes there's some some things that we do together i because sometimes you can see it some sometimes you can see that there is the that we both are in the same flow uh yes but it's just very rare in one hour it's very rare but sometimes we have these peaks and actually you can see it daddy because of the gaze and then from that point of view is very similar to what i say from dance and the solos is because then you because uh then you can see it actually that you can see like if i'm if i'm completely within myself then then my my i'm i'm observed but if i'm really like trying to listen to you like now then i have to be attentive not looking to my coach you know my eyes so the gaze is the face is and it's and it's something you cannot just act it's just like being you there and that's so i think we work so i think we work mostly when we work together within this content and then sometimes we try to work towards a message and i think it's just like person today we we start talking like clearly about this idea of a message like are we saying something for instance um yeah uh yeah so i think that's this is something very interesting this idea of the message yeah yeah i mean also something i didn't really answer but uh about the you know what what the message is and i think it's something i mean of course we don't have to like you know come up with anything right now but maybe it's something that we have to keep in mind um yeah i don't know i feel now i'm really saturated yeah yeah as well i have to go soon because i have a meeting of five yeah let's finish recording here yeah unless you want to add anything right and nope", "uPyWbUlyZ2c": "but yes you're sure yeah and also testing two different uh sounds no the recording settings okay it's actually quite annoying because i hear feedback of myself because you're because you're recording you're using something to record the inline audio yeah this is what you're doing yeah something like that oh this is quite annoying actually yeah yeah because what i do i don't know how you do in windows but what i do is like when i need to record a microphone and the line in i need to do something through something that was called yeah now it's called yes multi-audio device but it gives me some sometimes give me some yeah weird sounds because you're basically what you're what i'm doing with my computer is like i'm creating a virtual microphone okay like right now i and a virtual two lines in basically my computer has just one line in but then it just use it and it makes it two into into two lines uh and one then i use a line in and the other one for the microphone and that gives sometimes if i just touch my computer or if i move it will start just creating like electric static of weird stuff and that's very annoying i don't know how to set this up properly because what are you using that getting so annoying well the tool called voicemeeter because that kind of splits the one input to two outputs so i guess you'd see i need to hear it on my headphones and also i want to record it on other computer into two laptops yeah that's uh one thing i mean if i have a microphone on the other computer then that would be super easy but for some reason it's not working because i just changed of course of course yeah that will be the course of course okay this might actually help do you still hear me i hear you yes okay i think i i fixed it okay all right what's up party man um yeah it's good i mean i don't know what to start with but uh doing fine i feel a little bit busy on one hand but in fact i'm not that busy like i don't know this is good i was thinking because it gives me the impression of when i talk with you that you're doing so many things that partly of the reason actually that the or collaboration works is because in a way like we phone we both find that the practice that the best practices it just it sounds as a it works as a liberation space basically where let's say because they're so busy then you come there to just basically deliver it through things that you find that you're passionate about and they share with me right uh and it's the same way around for me it's the same for me but uh with a bit of twist uh because i'm still struggling a bit more new technology so but it still is the same uh from a different point of view but it still is the same then just to liberate my own frustrations and like certainly the last the last sessions that we have while i was in the chapel the last two i think i was actually since we since i couldn't use the internet and we use the phone because i couldn't use the internet basically so then i basically i was i was yeah i couldn't basically use my computer and because i couldn't use my computer i get relief from the tension that i have from all the technical issues that i'm from all the technicality and because i'm i'm i'm more like i feel myself that that's uh we both came come from different persp directions so like like they say computational and technical matters is something that i said i'm it's uh i'm immigrating into this so is this still something that is is not so easy for me to grasp and do a thing um so then let's say when i don't have the because i don't have internet so i don't have laptop then the first time that we tried and then it was with the iphone i was moving for the first time first and then after the internet came back and then just already i got basically the mood you know that mood then i remember there was the that was the first time uh that i was i was moving like within my within my contacts and naturally what i mean with this is because let's say choreographically why so like uh that's like saying then from my from my from my context uh the things that i experienced that maybe have could have been more experienced than you like saying dance then when i think from my pers from my perspective of my practice what i'm doing always i have the the the problem for me is moving within technological frameworks because as a dancer and then as a technologist let's say i found that it's very difficult to move body i'm basically i mean a good example because i put this example when i try to talk with other people is like if you put lasers and drunk drunk drunk song in a chapel you know like there is no way that the body can compete next to lasers you know it's just no it's a it's a fight loose loose fight so i i mean all the body has to be naked or the or you have to be or you have to do something drastic like cutting your beans or having a drastic i don't know like something something that is really violent that you catch the attention just by the action itself but just the technology and next to the body in in the in my experience and that was my i'm trying to frame is what i'm talking about is that for me was very difficult for myself you know like why do i pull my body in motion do i want to even dance i mean what is the what like i was having that question a lot and because of my frustration basically that day they like i was with the phone when i came back to the computer but when i have internet basically i remember that my frustration would became something shamanical because instead of saying like i remember like one of the things that i was saying that was puta that's a cursing in spanish because i'm i'm uh and then just from there and at some point you react to something and then just from there it's it makes it moves my body from my frustration right so then it from that that thing evolves to to become more layer so i'm more like an art form this is like this this coursing this basically this uh limitation that i have from what i'm doing it's just opening my my body basically because instead of then saying that then i will start just chanting you know saying or something and that was moving my body so and that was just from the last two sessions that i could allow the frustration that i have within my framework to move my body and that was something super liberating and then instead of trying to control and perfect perfect uh my framework and try to get to basically controlling then i just allow my frustration to move my body in the direction that i have to go and then i can go in more in a more uh trans way i mean more more yeah transcendental whole i mean close to in a way who i perceive you that sometimes when we go then at some point i feel you're gone in the sense like you are just in a state kind of like an urban state that you are just gone you know and if i talk to you like jesus will come into some place that you are you are you are moving and you are doing and like like you are not you are now to know more you know like there's a point when in the winter practices there's always a point when you're gone and then i can feel it that is like okay now it's like i isn't is is there now is isn't is it's like you enter to this perform performativity space where you are not in auto that i'm talking right now you know it's another spectrum that i know but it's not this one so i cannot i cannot approach him in the way who i'm approaching this one right and that's the way how i have perceived this i don't know how i mean i'm saying this just this uh i just i'm just reframing from from because i'm backing it at home and yeah and and i was thinking more like uh yeah i was yeah i started speaking all these things in terms of um how i feel that because like now i just finished the things from my school that i have been working all that [\u00a0__\u00a0] for all this time like three days ago and i was like you know a bit like with in a void like like in a sense that one hand my brain is like telling me like now what you know it's a bit hard to just compensate because you you come from a perf i mean like just pushing yourself like for three months and then you finish and then your body is like sleeping and so but that's the point your brain is like give me something you know and it's hard to deal with like okay i need to rest but i don't know i just i'm trying to reframe all these things within uh what you say like uh and when i'm asking you how are you how busy are you because normally you are super busy like with many pro projects yeah how are you so yeah um yeah in that sense like i do have many projects but i don't know if i'm really busy like i kind of have time in in a sense which is good um yeah and i don't know where to start again uh but you said interesting things like yeah just like having this practice i think it's like i do agree like for me it's easy if i know what time of the day of the week i need to do well i want to do this and then we just need and do it which is really great because if we don't schedule if we don't do it regularly then it gets like harder and harder to just do it and i don't say i'm busy super busy right now but even if i become busy i think it's it helps to have to say that we meet every thursday at nine and we do this so yeah i think it's totally doable and um so far i think one hour is good like it i thought it could be shorter at first i mean before we started to focus on the performance or practice session but yeah we still need some time because every time like technically it's not easy to start with and i mean technology wise but like you said it's also this frustration that's part of it but yeah i don't know like what can be like how well it's not how it should be done but um i don't know how to frame it like but basically i'm not really like i'm a huge fan of like dancing and doing some technical things at the same time like you said if you have the drone sound and laser then of course it's hard to perform in that space and it has to be like like you said it's or yeah but i think maybe actually i think maybe from this that we are touching there it might be something interesting that we can go more deep into it like because it's something i guess like you have experience i have experience as well like this is this is a reality you know like just putting the body next to the laser the drone is just very like a like fight no fight so but it could be maybe interesting in terms of like go more deep into like the concept or evolving even the material is like uh what does that mean you know not in terms of like are we trying to fix this but it's like what does it means you know because for whatever what i experienced like in your in your doing and by doing as well in the within the practice i'm 100 sure that we are honest when we are inside and then if we if what if i refer in terms like performance it has to be a lot with honesty from that's from my perspective and how i see performance then i think we are in the in the right place um so then it's more to think like uh yeah i don't know maybe just i'm just i'm putting some notes because i'm trying to start writing some some some text and it's like this idea that um i guess honesty no like some kind of like as so as as long as you are honest you know like that's what i call i mean honestly is what i call when it's the same when i call that you are in a trance i call it a trans because at some point i see you're gone and i see you in your eyes or is this very particular in your eyes because your eyes are gone it's like if you're high and that's something very particular that i understand at some point when you're gone and it's very it's literally how i see my friends or people when they get high that's just at some point they're just in their trip and that's beautiful you know because it's a it's a it's an honest uh sharing experience an honest transcendental shared experience that you're doing [Music] so what did i say yeah i think that kind of um it's not explained but yeah it kind of illustrates what's happening and i do think that it's like like frustration is also fine and it happens because we're honest like we're not like putting trying to make something pretty but it's just you know even if it's awkward we try it but yeah i think it's it's a good way it's a good way to find our practice because um i don't know like i don't want to refer to like specific thing but what's happened what happens often in like technology and dance is um technology dictates the performance and there's no like this like almost like zero uh practice happening inside like that someone decides you know like there's gonna be laser there's gonna be a robot there's gonna be something and then you do the choreography but how we do it yeah different right sorry like to reframe again what you're saying because i'm putting two in in a note because the thing is completely already with you so the technology dictates the performance yeah can you expand and can you expand again with this yeah i i don't know like i don't want to say anything specific but if it becomes like a large uh production then they have budget that's the kind of things that is like you know as because it's just the place that we are as soon as you you know you know if you work with a robot like the the production by itself is massive let's say if you put like a big arm robotic just the production is massive because of that and in terms of safety i mean on all the terms of what it needs to put the robot in the stage so then then then then it just changes completely the the framework right yeah and even if it's a projection as well like if it's a projection then it just like stays there as a huge you know installation in the state on the stage and there's not much you can do with the body right and also i mean but i don't know how you see it first thing but when i worked in a designer for like a choreographer then then then then it's like you know it's in a way it's easy kind of like i would say it's easy for me to let's work in projection or something with i don't know like some it will be more often like projection or some sensors then it will be easy in the sense of like the if the choreographer comes to me with some idea basically he wants to use something in his idea so he's not coming to me to develop that with me because anyway if he come i it it didn't happen so far that somebody comes to me with this um no so not yet because it's me the one who's proposing when i'm doing this collaboration is me the one who proposes but if i'm being the designer let's say if i have a client then it happens that basically for me it's easy because we still we are in the stage of like amazement so then if i just know what is the production if there is budget i just want to boom the stage to give what he wants uh and just make the boom you know because basically when he comes to me is with the boom idea so just give the boom idea back right uh yeah but i think my point is that it's just like so hard to like okay you make videos and you choreograph or work with movements so it's you know how think two things well you know two things but if you're like you know choreographer and like trying to collaborate with a video artist or vice versa then it's just like it's just a mess because there's no it's not a collaboration but it's just like two things on the same stage and like it's it's just hard to like find what why there there are two things like more than just a concept i mean concept-wise probably that people have interesting ideas but like they can practice they don't practice with that you know they have the video and they have a choreography they practice separately and then they just put it together yeah yeah that's it yeah i think it's yeah i think maybe there's you're referring to this idea like often so i guess now i'm getting this when when you mention about this idea of practice is like what you said is like if you because what we do know let's say if i'm or if i'm the choreographer then i practice my choreography or if i'm the video maker i practice my video making and my sk and apart to to pull your skills as a piano maker will do every day but then once you go to the stage the practices are not are not cohabited normally like just you put them together and that's what i mean that's what we've seen on normally in in productions is like they come together and there is one and the service of the other one and like let's say in the way who i have experienced so far is like when as a client the client comes then and then i will just give back something so basically then they want something technological in the dance piece so then it's just they're not there they just want my practice to put it inside of the framework so it will be dance and then the video projection of what i'm doing will be inside there but there is not this mix there is not a right there [Music] yeah like for example it could be like like a practice like as a like a workshop or something that video artists and dancers i think that's kind of a choreographic coding lab but it was you know they're not trying to do that but maybe they wanted to have a ground for that kind of things to happen so yeah like it could be you know like these people with two different expertise come together in a dance studio and they do something and it can become like a workshop for other people that you know you kind of get the idea of how to work with these two things at the same time or you can do it i mean it can be that but it's like it's not gonna work together i don't know i think i want to interrupt you there because i think that's important as well i mean this is that i think that's different so because we have so far this idea know like so we have when you have practices separate practices and let's say traditional theater or contemporary dance when you have like basically dance and then you have the video or some technology inside it still is dance and then you have the other practice inside there is another really something there's trying to become one thing it's just you basically hire the service of the designer of the whatever it is and to put the piece inside of the choreographic piece but then so that's one thing that we already redefined the other thing that you were referring that what i slowed you down is this idea let's say of the choreographic floating lab when they're trying to work like good from a a very good concept a very good approach which is very horizontal in that yeah i put to think two types of practices together and then they should try to make something together but then what we see often is what it happens after is not a common result but instead of that an engineer or a design product that is like we developed the solution for this but there is not a there is not a piece you know what i mean so it's different people yeah well i i'm actually interested like how you like categorized into two things like on one hand it's about theater and one thing is the let's say choreography lab kind of idea but i i'm not a theater person so i don't know like for example like what like what do people do as a lighting designer like what do they like how they do they learn it like because it's very specific to the theater and it's specific to maybe a contemporary dance has its own thing you know like it and like where is it coming from but it's also like it's nothing that is well it's very specific to dance and they have learned over time uh how to work with dancers in a way like what not how to work with but how because that's the thing that's the kind of like categorization that i'm trying to establish in order to evolve the conversation because he's like and then what we talk is like what because we still we are talking about like classical theater let's say including i mean i'm when i'm talking about classical theater i'm talking about contemporary dance inside of the theater basically i'm referring the space of performance where people go and sit and watch a show there's any card and then so then i think is just uh so what we are defining here is two different things that i think that are completely valuable for what you're trying to do because we are not i think we are not an either both because i think i think we are alienated somehow we have to define that after maybe uh after we're trying to get out of this this frame based framework that is so then you have in one hand define it that the the classical theater uh hire the services from other fields other practices let's say video practices sound practices technological practices if you talk in terms of like uh theater that wants to incorporate technology in it still the framework is theater and they just hire the services to put it in as blocks in it for some reason and that's one framework and there is classical and this is the why the one that like uh i know i know and uh that's a classical and the other one is like that we are trying to define that is very very interesting that is the proposition of the choreographic coding lab or trying actually to put the two practices and together and try to develop something therefore like the photographer graphic coding lab is not defined before a pre or as a performance no either as a practice but as a something that it might happens and that often that's what i'm trying to reframe as a problem that is often what it happens just end up being close to the point of view of an engineer or a designer which is solve the problem and they also that so i think are two to like kind of a framework and the other one the [Music] there is like a third aspect that is i think where we are that is we are proposing a practice when we are when we are based on technology dance is in there but we don't know what we're doing and we are just practicing while we are there so we define like now is very defined we have a framework of one hour and we define like doesn't matter what is happening during that hour we are practicing no matter what happens we have no internet connection you are in somebody's else house like no matter where are we we try to to make something happen in that framework and everything that happens in between it's okay because we are not defining yet if he's good or not because we don't know if what we're doing right and yeah and i think that's missing most of the time like people think that they know what they're doing but in fact it's not or it's just like happens randomly that you know some collaboration works sometimes because just it's just random and you know yeah i don't know this is really hard but like i think it was when i did the performance like this sort of thing with the light coding and all these things in may after that i just you know like it's just ridiculous that i was not like doing this kind of thing over and over because it's also like it happened online i don't know how many people are watching like 20 or 30 people i think and i can just do it by myself like i don't need that kind of you know institution i mean they're nice they are also like artists run uh place and i i do think they are really doing interesting things but like i don't have to like you know schedule something in three months we will do this with this uh institution and we do this on youtube live streaming like it's just like doesn't make sense you know if i want to do it then maybe i just we just do it every week and see how it goes because i think that's the easiest way and and we learned a lot from that um yeah i think i think i mean one of the i mean it's because like so what i'm trying to do is like here because maybe i'm putting this in so like one is like one point like we defined defined classical theater ether gloves uh hiring uh technology let's say technology and the second one is like the framework of the choreographic going lab where like the idea is very philanthropical i think the idea is great so with this idea of putting putting two practices pieces together and see what happens what happened but equals then normally what it happens is like you end up coming back to the engineer point of view or the designer point of view it's not really merging but they're just in the same space but i think you know why it happens a lot uh now i think it's because the people that you bring there their their background is more technology technological than dance wise so oh i don't know how you have experienced that i mean so in that sense like i was in three times in choreographic coding labs and i think two of them were like that in a sense that basically like they are coders and dancers and they just like don't talk to each other because it's just that yeah it's just hard they don't know what to do with each other that is hard enough like you know on the five fifth day you know just dancers are talking to each other coders are like doing something on their own and it just doesn't work but there was once uh i think that was that was in amsterdam that was really interesting i was because of the first experience in new york it didn't work well i thought i need to like talk to more people and maybe like bring people together or something and i try a lot in amsterdam and that worked well um like i brought i invited um dancers uh friends and i connected connected them to well one of them to a video artist that i met at the ccl and david did something interesting out of um her video like dance pieces that were filmed and the video artist made some some uh generative representation of it it's not just like because it's cool but it's there there was a idea that the dancer janine she wanted her piece is called screensaver and the work is actually um it's like five or six dancers they move really slowly that kind of makes a pattern inspired by screensaver i think it's a it's a mac experience area like this thing that slowly yeah so like the choreography is inspired like that and then i talked to this other video artist he makes he does like video jockey and he knows how to do like generative um yes he makes that kind of aesthetics from videos so he actually took her video and made it into a screensaver like video which was really cool because i think that's that's you know what should happen you know it's not just you know there's like cool video audio artists and interesting choreographers that just work together that there has to be some kind of context here and uh yeah yeah that kind of thing happened like there are a couple of other artists dancers collaborating and it was really fun like you know people just met for the first time they actually work together for something interesting or just fail and that's also interesting but yeah but i think that's really like a special case in ccl because yeah it's not always like that but i think i think i think it's beautiful like i i think what we should we should do is like more get out of the i mean now that we establish that that is that so we establish that we have like these two basic common grounds that we understand one is classical theater and the other one with the ccl there's a very beautiful approach a philanthropical that actually it gives a possibility actually for us to meet and and so and the other one that we are doing is uh and that i think that we should spend more of your time that i'm more interested in that is like the best practices um and what i what i found really one what you were saying is um this idea of like the context versus the content uh because the context i mean i both are so valuable when you're when you said in terms of when going back to like that reference like when you go back let's say to a spectrum like the ccl then when the context is given you know and then there's a good spirit to work towards something that is not really clear uh then the content it just appeared then the content appears and i mean and then this idea of the context and the content are being uh you know like uh it will be it will be changing constantly depending on the project but so i'm referring that in in our practice because we are very very uh i think we come from the context basically we should make which actually maybe it represents like the nature of the practice because it's it's come from technology like with all the technology so far we have no that's something actually that i'll put in the text here we have one limitation like that is very clear uh there is like without without internet uh or let's say without technology without tech without track or practice doesn't exist at this moment you know at this moment without technology or practices is not existing and i think that's very very clear it doesn't exist regardless it's the internet or something because then we saw with the iphone like technology is there so and the and and in in a way like then the technology in a way is like the context which is very close to the engineering this is very just it's just context but then the dance comes there and then i see the dances the content and you know like the dance and the idea about dance like the choreography part of the of the of the doing of the practice is where i see the content so what i'm trying to refer maybe in other words is like i see like the framework i mean all this technological thing that we spend there you know if i see my screen i have like open like madmapper bdmx like all these things at the same time like light smoke machines what i was doing in that place in the chapel all this very complex setup for me it's just that's all the con it just it gives all this context it gives a possibility to the content to appear that's what i was referring to like just lately i can i can let my frustration try to control all the setup allow my body to move that's pure so that and that so that purity comes from the content but not the context but i need the context i need i need the technological context without the technological context uh i i cannot exist i mean or you cannot exist as well in the practice so is like the the relation i'm trying to like reframe basically that i see context as the technological frameworks that we have and the content as concept as the dance itself as the choreographic aspects i see the two there that's the way i see it in my my understanding of the practice but um i don't know how i don't know how you like for me when you say content it also it's also about videos and you know different effects and like it's very technological things as well and i mean of course movements are uh content but i mean it's a bit like not cheesy but it's sort of like i don't want to say it this way but also like body is in a way it's technology and then you know it's it's kind of a boundary that but let's just go to that direction but uh no i mean i feel like i think that let me maybe just reflect because i would like to hear you actually like what you really think i don't i'm not trying to sell you my point of view just like i think this is the spaces that i really really like to so this is my understanding you know this is my understanding this is how i see this so i would like to like just if you think it's like that just like it's okay and yeah i i don't know if well it's hard to like give um comments directly because i i think i still are having a hard time understanding your um kind of the way you're using content in the context because no but i do i think i do understand in a way so i'll try to start from there but for me like i i just don't like to work with technology in general because it for me it's something it doesn't work uh i know it's it's weird to say that from me but like by itself you mean technology by itself or what do you mean yeah because like i always fear that something won't work and yeah okay okay okay so then we are talking about the content that's coming from path but this idea of accountability and colorado like you know if if we have um like any other like technical problems like it's not just the wi-fi at the that path but also you know maybe my computer dies or my computer dies or whatever power outage then it doesn't work but still i guess yeah you can dance but then you cannot exist in the in the common practice no and that's really interesting to me because i was always thinking that i want to work with dance without technology because that i kind of felt that's something that i should aim for because it's i don't know somehow i thought it's really great that i don't rely on technology and i just like express myself with boy okay but then it's really interesting because if i work with you then okay we can say that you know we move together at 9 00 p.m and somehow you know maybe we don't have internet but let's move together that's also possible and people from decades ago they're doing that already right yeah you're right yeah yeah and so what's the point i don't know but now like it's we're dependent on the technology yes that's true and but at the same time you have a smoke machine or like video mapping which is something we decided to use like i didn't ask you to do it for example but it's a constraint or the context that you brought in and why and well i'm not saying because but uh you know like how the hell is things because okay so uh because then the thing we are what we were talking here like is about uh purity that's what i call purity what is pure the inside of the practice what are the elements that we cannot take away for the practice to happen you see what i mean like uh when i'm preferable so yeah i think yeah that's true but also yeah but actually this is a good question because if we say that we work on jitsi or live lab that doesn't mean we have to like for example you don't have to use smoke machine i don't have to use hydra but we do it anyways right and right why and should we continue doing it should we try to look for something else i think that's part of the practice um yeah but i think for me it's it's always really interesting to think about like why are we trying to use this certain technology and why didn't you why couldn't you get away from it or why did you didn't you choose other tool yeah but it's also like always connected to the content as well because if it's something totally new then you have to ha content how you mix it with the content how you see it because maybe maybe i would like this separation maybe i would like to change in my because i have in my text here like content no context versus concept i will say better than content i will say like the concept instead of content so i would like to hear what you refer about content oh because for me things that yeah yeah yeah now i'm i'm kind of erasing that i'm replacing that from concept because my context in my concept is like i can't my context is very my background is very very bj wise so then my content basically are just bj loops or generic videos that i'm gonna create to video map sure uh sorry about how so because you're referring about content so maybe yeah content no because the content is highly dependent on the context that what you have right yeah and also your experience because if you're like new to certain tool then you have to kind of start with scratch in terms of content all right okay you can also say it as a vocabulary like if you're familiar with certain context then you have more vocabulary or content which is bad but concept is you know it's always kind of [\u00a0__\u00a0] because you can just always write it down afterwards but so that that's what i mean like so because like i will reframe again so like i have now in my in when i said like so one the classical theater second ccl third best practices and then i put like then context slash uh context with content because it's like in a way content is a consequence of the context then i say like versus the concept when i put it there concept for me is the dance is what is happening in it uh and what i will call purity what i will say when we transcend transcend and when you and me are gone in what we are doing uh then for me is that the concept one one one like ideas below classical understanding of the concept is like we are grinding or what we are doing now we are trying to use rationally thinking in order to conceptualize what you're doing right um that's one like one rational way of thinking about concept writing the text for an application or just making sense of what one do uh but in the way who i present this idea of concept and are doing what i said like content con context content versus concept is that uh i see the concept close to purity the the the purity and the existential the concept as they as the purity and as the uh yeah as the the purity the what it is actually what it in what in what at the end is what we're aiming for that it just happens you know when just you transcend and you're happy what you're doing and it's just the damn past flying and then just one hour is gone and there is there is not too much rationalization at that moment because from my understanding is because we have been practicing so much you don't have to refer about the content context anymore because it's just being settled in your body so you don't have to refer about how do i open a window how do i do this at that moment you are just in flow what you will call an english flow you are flowing and you are just in the in what i was trying to refer as concept you are just dancing you are just being pure and then sharing the purity of your doing i see and i think what i'm not happy with well like for me uh from i'm not happy with what i do in terms of then i think well i think it's somewhere between the content and the context because i'm not still i'm still not sure like for example i use hydra to do some effects on video which i don't know if that's it kind of blocks the flow like if i just code then i can just code but i code and then i go back to the movement which is totally wrong to me how come because it's just you see that moment between you are dancing and going back to coding because that's like the conscious decision i have to make that okay i'm gonna code or i'm gonna go back to the movement and then it's not something that can be that can happen together it's totally separate practice practices well but in in i don't know maybe if the way how i see him because i'm just trying to put an example from dance first when you're dancing like let's say i have a technical background so then when i'm dancing one of the reasons that i stop dancing is because my technical background blocked me from the purity basically so it's it's the same basically i will feel doing the same that if i stop being pure and then just stop on coding because then i will be just coding with my body now i will use a uh saute and um now i will do movements from capoeira now i'll use the technology like the technical tools that i know and then at some point i will left that again and just let my body move so basically then i would be as well being between being in the flow and then going to technology yeah yeah which i think i don't have that much technology in my body but i do agree with that because i'm not moving randomly but i do make conscious decisions and when i think i'm doing something repetitive then i start to think you know what's what do i want and it's not and it's not the same that framework the one you said like i stopped moving and now i'm coding in terms of decision in terms of like desiring in terms of desire and i wish to do something then i do this don't you think this is simpler like between the the the when you're dancing and are taking the decisions of dancing because you want to change because you find a path from whatever on when you are in the flow of dancing and in the other hand when you are dancing and when you're coding basically when you stop the flow right um it's i think it's an interesting question and i think they are interesting analogy and there are some similarities but for me it's very different because at least for me when i move and start to think about different patterns or different rules of moving it's something that i can adjust through my body i can try with my body and see if that feels right or not or whatever if it feels not right but maybe i just go with it it's something that happens within myself that if i want to code then it's like motor wise it's totally different like i'm not like using my whole body anymore and i have to code and then i have to look at the screen i have to think about well okay think about the rules that's the same but it's very specific i have to be very precise no i have to be accurate about what i do and um but this person i think this precision comes as well from assumption in terms of like we are dealing constantly with this this in this framework of uh like in any other place in life uh of desiring you know like the despairs like what do i want to do like the image of what i'm projecting i would like to do them because i would like to do something i decide to take the corresponding actions in order to achieve the the corresponding goal and the um yeah i don't know what i was trying to say with that okay i don't know i have to think about this and i think this is really interesting question because i never thought about comparing the move let's say the movement pattern and the coding uh but in intuitively i think it's they are fundamentally different but i don't know why i cannot explain it right now no but i i mean i agree with you that are fundamentally um from a rational perspective but i think in the order of actions and then going back to this idea of like how you reflect in the doing um with the purity of the act then i think they come from different frameworks um because then because one will be i don't know in a ways like when you if you start categorizing things and you will start saying that one will be more pure or less pure than the other one right and then and then it's up to what you want or what i want at certain moments what i mean with purity is like this the flow when i mean with flow like when we are uh we're trying to get into that flow trying to get into the transcendental state when you're getting high from what you're doing i see yeah i i don't know i thought about something that i forgot but yeah i think it's it's also something that i feel always kind of feels so uncomfortable when i called i think it's maybe it's a different kind of flow that i experienced that i i do enjoy that kind of flow of coding but at the same time it's it feels like something is totally wrong and when i move i don't tap that like when i when i move it's just like it's maybe there's a pure purity that i experience you know i never think that it's okay this is wrong because i don't know why but yeah i don't know but i think i i i see myself in your words because but i think it has to be that's what i think that our practice is so uh i think that's why we're still doing this and we're hooked because in a way it seems like a drug to me you know like when i was in my deadlines that i could not do it for one week i was when i talked to you i really felt the empty space almost like oh my god i want to be in the space again it's like a drug space there for liberation and when you refer off of this space of flowing then in my context and with my setup is like uh although then i would code but it's not that much i will because the setup is so big i was doing there then it's just at some point i will just start flowing and then i will just move between madmapper and bdmx and all these things and then i would move with the siphons and then i feel i'm in the flow well if i'm dancing then i will feel more awkward i will often will feel that i'm doing something that is not right because my because i have more knowledge there to choose in my motion so what i'm trying to refer is like i i feel what you feel when you're coding when i'm dancing because maybe my vocabulary in dancing is is bigger and i think it could be the same with you and your coding your vocabulary is bigger so then you feel that it's wrong that you should be doing something better because you know you can do something better and then you're confronting again with this idea of desires that i'm trying to bring into the conversation the desire of doing better no matter what yeah i mean i think that's an interesting aspect i don't fully agree with that but i mean it is certainly a point but to me it's more about the nature of movement and coding but but i think that's that's what you said is also quite it is it does contribute to some extent it's becoming academic or something oh but i think it's what we're trying to do here is like right now we're trying to advance uh in a in a dialogue basically in a reflection of what we're doing yeah so it's like when we feel that we're we're doing good and i think in order to like i guess explore more we need to one of the comments i remember danielle said like in that email he was referring about methodologies which is something that you do really when you get into really academic studies or when you actually want to extend uh i think that's the lacking version of the ccl is like because there is no more time than the ccl there is no time to to really uh study about that methodologies how the things are happening um and i think that one of the the things that daniel said in that email that was so so i still remember is that he was saying like make sure in a way he was saying like you guys make sure to like to point out the methodology how are you doing things um and i think that's what we are trying to do here when we stay when we try to dial up yeah i mean it's it's true like ccl is more like a party you know it's just like well it's it's five days but it's like you know people come together and do something interesting and that's it which is good and bad because it's fun it's so intense but you don't kind of leave anything behind almost because it's just you know it's a party and you don't have to leave anything but there's so many interesting things happen and i was reading some texts from like more like notes from past ccls and there are there are some things that has to be uh maybe revised polished and should be published somewhere because or like not published but made it make it public because certainly like some people would be interested in that kind of thing especially like maybe it's not really like universal thing for working with technology and dance but at least it's a record of what happens if people with these expertise come together and spend a few days together what kind of discussion will happen which is you know totally a valuable documentation of that kind of case study yeah i i think like because i i saw something that you post in the in the in the ccl in facebook are like are you are you you are asking for to have a maybe like uh something about it like to if there's some some text or something about ccls because it was about this did you propose something about the note 20 that is the one when i post it yeah so yeah this is something i also wanted to talk about because i'm so uh where to start with so at the festival node forum basically uh now the plan is that i will be hosting events in that in their mozilla hubs i don't know if you know that vr online space where you can access from the browser and uh like mozilla hops linked down and then i just put it here to check it out uh like that one they haven't finished it yet but you can just search for mozilla hubs and find something um okay yeah okay but so you're saying that now they want you to like uh more host some events within your uh activities there yeah and uh so we will have like some discussions and these these meetups are open to anyone like you don't have to sign up for the festival because you know the festival pass cost like 50 euro or something but for for this thing it was a hub so you don't like it's free and we'll have discussions we'll have meetups uh i'm trying to do hydra meetup as well and there's gonna be well i think i want to do some kind of practice with you like how we do it uh either in hubs or we can do it on jitsi or live lab i i think that's not a problem uh what else and maybe some kind of exhibition in that space and for the maybe i think could be interesting i don't know if you could because i'm sure like there should be people who will be interesting interested in uh from the ccl and maybe con contribute and in um yeah basically talking about methodologies because i think i think a point that we are that i think is very interesting and it is referring again to danielle and maybe i will maybe could be interesting as well maybe both danielle from his own experience that is uh since in a way we don't know for reason like we have a good example and this is a proof of concept like what we're referring is like there is a problem with dancing technology when you're trying to put two practices together in the sense that uh we basically in order to it's coming from our practice in order to get to something that is moving you need to get into the flow and basically it means like to refuse a lot of your desires and things that you would like to do that couldn't or not so you have to basically don't know in a way what you're doing you need to be in the doing and because of that i think it's necessary then not too much to think out we create the new application that will has a new better motion tracking of you know solutions but i think it will be more relevant to talk about the even not the process but actually the methodologies how you end up coming up with something like that uh so and that could be interesting maybe to refer to the sal and see if there is somebody with i'm sure like people who work before they could have extend part of their doing while maybe not the result as such but i'm sure they should have in their own archives like as as concepts uh as methodological concepts if you want to call it like what happened you know kind of like a as a diary what happened because what i think could be interesting for the field is to have this insight in terms of what are the methodologies that have been applied what people already tried and to not start from zero because that's basically what we're doing yeah it's true um so for that i think i'm asking uh [Music] mariah she's well what she does is not so relevant i would say like she does vr uh she makes vr pieces with uh motion capture data so and she's like also part of the festival she's presenting her work so that's why um we're in touch and she's gonna give some insight to yeah like working with vr but definitely like it's more interesting if we have some people who's you know more into like how do i say performing performing arts i don't know what like i don't know what how to create it um of course daniel yeah interested in like uh daniel and uh lisa what they're doing i think it's yeah it could be interesting to i mean one thing that i think for sure could work um but there's just a completely different work that is so much work is like one could approach practices you know open practices like say uh performance performance practices or let's say dance practices next to other kind of practices they they are a lot um and then one what could do is like try to create an analogy when you just work from abstractions in terms of technology um let's say like one of the the things that they were working with lisa and daniel if i'm not wrong is like they were setting up this meeting where people were like there and they were sharing and then sometimes they were moving so i don't know exactly what they were doing and what is the framework but as an example could be one could take the work of trying to abstract the methodology of the work and as uh and they just kind of put it into a technological context uh you know as an abstraction because that's already uh a methodology of way of work that they already tried for a long time that they found it was i mean there is so much uh work already around that idea that uh that is abstraction is meaning let's say for saying that i'm trying to put it in computational terms like if you say like then you have like the the work they're doing so then where they propose to be to have entities sharing a space where some of these so these entities there they are framework they have a framework where uh there are certain movements that can be perceived in a frame like seeing a screen smaller screens and and then there is some possibilities based on propositions for per day like what could uh be possible for these entities to output within the the the grabber the container um so that's that's an idea for that's an abstraction for it that's not a way to like to analyze and try to put more in something that can be replicated into a computational system um uh but but that's what i refrain with that like that could be possible with uh dance practices uh mixing with other things but again and that's what how we start the whole pronunciation that will take so much work because it means like one needs to do the whole abstraction in terms of first understanding for one and then to put it in into another language um so i think like the easiest will be this practice is not really like well articulated in the first place it's something that they develop through let's say practice and then they have to kind of self uh how to say it yeah like analyze themselves what they're doing and no i mean what i'm saying with that in terms of the the though i'm saying with abstraction is like just to abstract that what they're doing actually is not technologically wise it's not it's not super interesting in terms of let's say they're not working with so many other uh complex systems let's say uh but then in terms of like putting abstract of what they're doing and putting into something that is can give more insights for a technological background could be more interesting instead of all the sociological and human aspects of being the people in this context and with all the human thing will be more relevant to abstract that into something that becomes more computational language uh that can be replicated through entities in a in a system uh that's what i mean which is with the with abstraction like to abstract let's say their context is very social so it's very human uh and i think in terms like to make it that conversation relevant for for a field like dance technological field will be more relevant in terms to use the methodology if one can do decoratorial process of abstract what is interesting there in terms of technological use more than the social aspect um uh yeah yeah and but that that means anyway like then one has to take all the work to do this basically translation and try to uh propose because it still will be a correctorial process of proposing and an idea from an existing framework um i think ideally what i'm trying just to say is like that could happen that could work uh but then then what i think would be easier is just if we find people who already have are being very very constrained by technological uh frameworks let's say a good example is us because we for good or bad we define i mean we end up getting very complicated and things um so then uh so i'm that i'm saying like this example of us could help a lot because then we use a lot of system no then you use hydra and we use all these kind of things we use the streaming we compilate the video synthesis all the latency like all different softwares all these kind of things so it's very by itself you don't have to translate or you need to you don't need to abstract the methodology or the content that is being created there to try to just give it as wrong material for the field to see like okay there is this thing happening here and so i think what could be interesting is like if to find other people that have uh let's say that's why i was referring like with the ccl and see if that some people have some archives on their own doing back in time in terms of methodology we're talking about here's what i think i think at some point that i think i can i can i can say from this conversation that it seems very clear to me that is interesting not only for us but more for the field as such is this idea of the methodology uh which is that daniel the daniel and he comes he same from his own experience and he's he has been working that for a while because in that same in that sense then you can really uh offer more than a solution in terms of like design i give you the better motion tracking device instead of doing that that's something that we we do often then instead of that then you are proposing they actually just you're giving a access to information about methodologies uh with which people have so far in terms of like let's say performance and technology it's just something is being greeted right now yeah i feel it's i'm still not fully uh i mean i i understand literally but not conceptually but i can just like talk about like what i wrote in the facebook group basically so i where did i uh where should i start uh so so we do the events in the mozilla hubs and one of the discussions i want okay i said also i talked about maria she's working with vr which i don't know if it's how much relevant to us another thing i wrote in the group was about this thing called trackable qualities which i think is really funny term to me they always talk about this in the past ccls i think they i think in the first ccl they came up with this idea of trackable qualities and since then i think scott or florian like running this ccl they always introduce this idea to people and people start to talk about what it is it's basically um what kind of quality you can extract from the trackable measure like motion capture or it can be like heart rate or whatever kind of you know bio sensing tracking device and but like that gives you just numbers and what kind of abstraction you can get by the signals so when you talk about qualities then your quality is something that is very human no it's like i mean as uh this quad this quality is something that is not one normally no like that's what it gives like that's what maybe is like interesting as as concept is because it has the the possibility to be interpreted in in different ways because a quality is something that you can i mean is not something that you will quantify per se uh like a person is happy more happier uh even though the the the measurement it is in in in the frame between being happy or happier it means that you're happier than the happy person so there is the quantity in there is is a a question of quality uh i mean it's more human what i'm trying to say is more human but that's what i found very very thing from this thing yeah i such as link it's it's still very i think it's less human that's it's not as abstracted but it gives you know like terms like center of mass bounding box that's that's really technical uh kinetic sphere which may be a little bit more abstract um i don't know it's very technical but like it becomes you know like uh there's like texture of movement like fix thick versus soft which is really um more human like it's you know it's getting away from the um the numbers that get from the sensors or groove yeah which i think this is like this always comes back to uh like discussion back into discussion in ccls because it's you know it's somewhat easy to talk about because everyone has different kind of background but if you work with dancing technology this is something that you always face you know with uh um yeah like tracking and what can you get from traffic what do you do with the tracking yeah so this and they're like i think people try to make it more understand it systematically which obviously it's not there yet but they did try to make some effort to do that and i think it's again it's not like directly related to what we're doing but i think it's kind of interesting thing to talk about if we have both like people from dance and people from technology but again it's like i don't know uh i'm interested but like i don't want to talk about the center of mass or bounding books because it just like you know it just like makes no sense to do all these things when you talk about trackable qualities uh yeah i don't know what you think um no i just i think that uh i think it's what are you saying like you would like to propose of this in the in the in node 20. is the way how proposing that that you're quite thinking one session for this because i was to be honest i was never really interested in this discussion because it's just like it's just funny but i think it's you know definitely would be a very very very interesting uh place where if you invite people from different fields i mean so then it's you as mother moderator then you make sure that you invite people like are like people who are just like say pure theoretical i don't know dancers or like i'm pure like uh engineers and to just try to put them together uh then then i think it will certainly something that it will be uh i mean it's the this is the perfect framework for people uh for uh for a forum for people to speak for hours you know so uh i think it's uh we're doing a discussion or anything it's just like an informal discussion but that could i mean but yeah yeah but like i i see this is the kind of subject that will be certainly valid in a panel in a panel like no like i was certainly interested in seeing what people have to say about something that they call trackable qualities it seems very yeah yeah it's uh because i think she will i think they will be interested in doing this because so basically node node is run by the you know like this overlap between node and ccl and john is who was running the ccl and she's also a director of this festival and they all like they seem to be all really like this trackable qualities although well i don't know what it is and i might be able but then i think what i found interesting is like to um invite people to the conversation to try to establish but then not necessary people who are completely involved with the term because then they have a they have a more pure approach to it but i think that will that will make the conversation interesting yeah because because if you invite people who already are used to the term they're just going to patronize you right from like think no i mean and i think that will be i don't think there's not so many people who's really um how to say there's no expert in this and also like everyone has different kind of you know uh it it's not some like there's no common ground for this tractable qualities and everyone maybe like people have like different even like different terms for this kind of concept which is interesting like also like we can maybe find a name for another new name for trackable qualities or whatever uh yeah i'll think about it because i also want to hear what people think about this thing and i'm always like skeptical of actually uh draggable qualities because like it's it's to me like the name itself seems so nonsense well that's what makes it interesting wait i'm coming back i'm just gonna go to the toilet for a second [Music] hmm [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so i'm a bit curious a bit so is this node 20 is gonna be completely on line or it's gonna be a physical space uh both and i will be in frankfurt because because maybe like because maybe i will be interesting to go there if i have the time yeah i mean it's gonna be in frankfort and uh which days are those it's like in october october 2nd to 8th and i think i can get your ticket for the festival uh 10 [Music] 7 to eight in frankfurt and good okay i'm gonna check but i think i would like to go if it's physical i think i would like to go there could be but then we have to solve is the problem because then if we still be doing a girl we're gonna do the best practices we need to isolate ourselves and being separate and that would be very but even that could be interesting i mean you know just like i heard this from uh daniel and lisa that she well they were like working together for i don't know like few years and like always remotely and finally when they met to work together like in a residency or something like they end up working in the same space but in a separate rooms because it's just like it's important to like move together in the same so i was thinking like that would be so i mean we cannot do that like in the same room that is absurd but that but i think that will be that i think that could be a a good place a good moment we can meet we can meet yeah and then we could be interesting as well because then for me what was interesting for me to invite you to path is like because then we could have a framework like to to basically what we do but extending and then i think in frankfurt as well then we could have find other things to uh uh talk about you know i would like to hear your point of view like i like from this conversation that we have i started seeing like we have and that's more my intention you know because maybe i speak so much then is that i would like to hear the many times that i i don't try to convince you of my words and i want to hear what you think and in this conversation for instance like then it's clear that because i'm as well i'm trying to start uh developing a ground of concept that we can evolve then uh is is it's good that i hear like for you that you're saying yeah but this is not i don't see like this and this kind of things i think i would like to hear more from you know we see a performance or something and i would like to see what you think and uh hopefully the thing yeah so i think that would be that would be a a good thing i'm gonna really check and i think that could be it's a week you know that could be that is i mean it's a week it's from the second to the eighth yeah it's a week yeah it's from friday till thursday uh yes no but of course like we can just like we could be in and out i mean we can just be there partly and we can find time to work together or not working together i mean in terms of out of this like i don't know like that's i don't know how you see like but my approach to dance was always like when i was dancing uh and then it was like when i was going to festivals like always i i found myself very bored very fast from dance and because then i was in dance and let's say in dance festival the impulse dance on these places i was always like uh used to think culture of him uh because i didn't want to be around of people who were speaking about dance all the time and then so for me was always that i was to vienna i was even though i have a place you know like stay there in the impulse i was very happy to spend time with locals um and then because i was just i get and but that was my relation with dance my my relationship with dance always has been very conflicted so it was like oh no no more dance no more these people with this thing it's like i just get out i just want to have i just want to to feel my myself in the city um yeah i was doing that i don't know how how you feel like do you feel something like overwhelmed by let's say technology or things that you normally i mean i'm saying from work in your personal life when you are in this environment you know then everywhere that you go you go to one corner and there's somebody hello what do you think about this and this and blah blah blah blah blah don't you experienced something similar in festivals in the past you mean in technical like technology during yeah i'm trying to think like what would be technical like how to say digital art equivalent of impulses for example but it's i mean that festival is like really special so it's hard to like yeah it's very hard yeah but i do think wait a second i think i mean if i like let's say like when i'm in tokyo for example like it's a bit like that like like but constantly like you know i meet people who's who works with these digital art or like very specific to like like coding environments making videos and stuff and then like i just hang out with those people or work with those people and just like i don't know how to say it yeah like it's just like saturated or i feel really like i cannot go anywhere you know if i'm just hanging around that was my feeling because the impulse is a small island then there's like you can go anywhere so then it for me was drastically i need to go to somebody else out and leave and sleep in the couch for a week yeah yeah i mean people say that like so i did uh dance with in 2016 and people like everyone says you know like uh like people like when i met they did dance with before like this really intense four or five weeks you know like every day you were doing workshop and watching performances and they come back after a few years or like after one year like they just like enjoy the festival so much because you just have so much more time and you know room to enjoy things you know like not just like taking a workshop all day which totally makes sense i went back to the festival like the following year and that was uh i yeah that was like different you know like i had time alone and or you know just like doing nothing in vienna which is quite nice it's a nice city also and it's beautiful yeah to find a bicycle for instance beautiful yeah yeah totally yeah so yeah and that yeah also that festival is a bit too much you know it's it's really political or apolitical and yeah it's hard to be engaged full time i think i mean i think it's like any any frameworks like i don't know for instance like i don't know how is node but like it's i mean path for everything the good example of this is but that's more like my perception that will build the world no i i think i position myself as a as an immigrant in in in different contexts as a translator i think i expressed that idea to you at some point like i feel always like in in an in between i will call myself an as an in-betweener i like to be the place the person who facilitates um so because of that as well like in a place for instance like path that is is like the most anarchist in that sense you know super anarchist in that sense even in a place like that then i i feel very constrained by the framework and like and then i need to go out and bicycle for instance like it's a place that is very warm and people are very doing that they're trying to to leave it as a common it's a commons place and and that place i'm trying to say like with that person with the impulse and oh okay but that's let's say the impulse dance is very i always have these contradictions that are in your face too strong from uh to to avoid it to just look around you know when you talk about i don't know from a place of privilege place for me it's difficult coming from a country like colombia for instance like when i hear somebody talking about poverty when they come from sweden for me it's difficult to just swallow and stay in the conversation so or i and i was more in the past or either i have to generate a conflict where people will get uncomfortable or i need to take space and then go out because i need to breed and that's the way how i feel with frameworks like uh privileged places so in the impulse dance for like you see like people are talking about neoliberalism and postcolonialism and all these kind of things but it's easy but i mean it's easy just to find the time to think when you don't have five kids and you are not poor and being killed in the corner things like this i don't know i mean i'm saying because i'm very i'm privileged as well i'm coming from a medium-high class in colombia that i could go to university not everybody can go there stuff like that so i don't experience this kind of things but but i come from a place where these things are happening so then then because of that then i feel more sensible as well this this uh objects yeah i mean well i don't know about no like it's it's also you know it's run by german people and um it's also like how they say i don't know i've never been to that festival like i heard of it a lot i know like many friends are presenting there also i know john who's directing the festival because she's running ccl's um yeah uh i don't know it's but it's more like kind of conference and it's also like run by people who may develop who are developing uh dvd i don't know if you know this uh but doesn't doesn't seem to be like this uh code node based uh programming so yeah yeah so they're running it so they have like a bunch of workshops so yeah it's it's very technical um background i would say and but also they talk about you know like i don't know if you know uh what's his name julian oliver he's doing like a very poetic political work in digital art like he's uh like about uh like i would say like climate change and stuff okay and i think this festival this edition they are kind of having like a lab format for uh like discussing these issues from technology and psychology yeah i i read the the the the head the heading yeah and i found it like a complete i mean i completely agree with this thing that happened some this uh conversation with my my girlfriend like some days ago about uh yeah basically that now basically the same framework like how the place that we are being taken because of because we wanted technology to help us to basically advance to from point a to b and then now we are here but then we realize there's so much damage that we're doing the planet so how the makers can think about it something from from the practice itself and i think it's too i mean i think it's totally uh i mean this is the place that we are no that's the place that we are um and there are some people who are thinking like more like uh if i think first i mean off whereas you people from different practices many of those coming from performance practices they try to do approaches the their ecological approaches maybe not directly in terms of like with the planet uh with the plants but then in terms of like uh sociological or anthropological inclusion or like thinking around how to make better basically a place of belief um yeah i mean i i think i'm a bit tired to well like i'm not tired of talking but i'm tired to talk about these things so i'll skip that and also like you know there's also again it's it's just like you what you talked about input sounds like for example like i don't want to like criticize too much but uh julian oliver he's working a lot from uh digital art to you know like well basically he wants to change the world uh in terms of climate change and all these things but like he's also really pretty village and like he says like we should boycott google for example but you know because it's funny like my supervisor he said like he's basically julian owens like a technological vegan or whatever you know like for example we can not use google but then that because you have you know i like that i like because you have money or you have you know you can accept that somehow yeah i mean i think the same thing that is happening with the corona like for countries is not a problem for a rich person like to take distance right it's not a problem to be in your mansion or go to your beach house to your lake house and stay there for a lockdown of course the problem is if you're a privilege but if you're not there is a problem because you have to be within the framework so yeah if somebody said like they just [\u00a0__\u00a0] up the whole system yeah you can go to your chalet yeah exactly so yeah yeah i don't want to like start complaining of these things but uh yeah and we can wrap up yeah we should but i i want to come back to this um i want to say something about martin like i was reading his you know like the book you sent me and like the one he edited well which one the movement research the movement which one like movement research that was the last one okay the the first one is like dance uh 2.0 post dance 2.0 and the second one is uh movement research yeah i i just like started reading like i can i can send you as well like i don't know if i got the the other one anyways but i kind of i mean of course like it's like written by many dancers so i agree or i i found something interesting in some some of them and i found like [\u00a0__\u00a0] about some of them and but it's really nice like how he like that he did this you know and then i remember that uh when i was a impulsive i was i saw him uh i mean of course he was he's always at this festival and i i saw his piece but also i remember seeing him taking a workshop and i think he was just like taking a bunch of workshops like different workshops every day and just like trying things you know which which i found was it's really interesting like i i still like i don't know if i like him or not but like it's it's really interesting how he does it you know yeah martin is like i mean because for instance that now i was in pub for two months no and martin is one of the shareholders of that place and then uh then you see i mean martin was just such a horrible i mean like martin has this reputation of like oh basically all this me too movement is completely martin you know like the way oh he just like used his presence to just take young women and all these things like that's completely martin's personality uh but like he he's recently become a father and and and people said i haven't seen him maybe maybe two years and people said that he changed a lot since uh since he became a father uh as well in the in in in the way oh he said things because before i mean he started from this basically uh spam spam varian isn't basically just uh this manifesto where he's just like saying [\u00a0__\u00a0] up this is what i think this is the thing uh which many of the things i relate with uh it's a very clever person as well he's a philosopher no so that's something as well that is a bit tricky always like when you're a philosopher like your fills with the words so it's somebody who really can make speech about it um but then what i heard from people that i met during these two months sometimes people come and go and people were referring to him that the people who saw him recently as well to his last work then he's so more down to earth and then the kind of thing that he will said now they're uh maybe not completely different maybe just uh there is a different approach let's say there's much more uh respect in a way to who are you saying things well before he was saying just world this is my thought and this is it take it or leave it and now he's a bit more uh conservative i think which i haven't experienced so far so i would like to see him so yeah but that's martin is somebody who is very uh in my personal uh approach to dance has influenced a lot of my my thinking um and i think in in general like the way how like performance art and relation with the world with the contemporary contemporary um he uh put a lot of things there because of his approach basically so but he put many of these things there uh so basically he just generated a huge conflict from many people which is good uh yeah so yeah and i think the last thing that i don't know i think he did the last thing it was like the eat well i don't know that should not be the last one but one of the pieces that he works about internet i think was there is one thing called the internet i think okay uh and i think he's just painting himself in green i think basically i think that's what he's doing while he i think he's singing something from yeah some like teach pop songs and stuff like that like other pieces yeah sure that's the thing um because he's martin so he said yeah okay i'm gonna do it i will do it and i did uh but i i definitely i think it's a uh this is it's an interesting character to maybe we should maybe just play pop song next time we do best practice from rihanna or whatever see what happens oh so yeah okay but so we have like next practice like we're gonna keep like and thursday nine p.m yeah is that good for you i think so yeah uh it's always is everything no just we just we keep in touch and then just yeah i think first is fine i just have something during the day but i'll be back by nine so totally works okay yeah it seems good to me and then maybe i i agree with you that we we can't be more uh how to say like be more uh aggressive like one day we can really like just put the rihanna so maybe one day maybe one day without telling the other one just like while we're doing this and all of this other international in the background like sure uh we just we do i think like one what what i think is interesting is that um we should not agree in the frameworks i mean a particles you know like where are we going live lab you know these kind of things a part of like some basic place that we're going we should not agree too much in what are we doing if one day you feel or i feel then i would do like okay in a in a tongue with them with rihanna so be uh and that's part of the practice and then just we deal with what happens with it and then i start painting myself green i just really started imagining myself like completely naked just in a song a green song and with chroma with some rihanna in the back yeah yeah yeah like yeah we i think we can start like playing more with these things as well i'm curious because this is the first time that i'm gonna try it with all my smoke machines with my without my dmx lights so we'll see so this time to use the i need to make work that [\u00a0__\u00a0] i okay but i can do it through hydra like i need to work with the chroma uh because the last sessions i didn't work with chroma because i didn't need it i was using my background but in this session i'm gonna i'm gonna work in with my chroma and since the obs is not working anymore i just through hydra so i'm gonna try and if i cannot make it work then maybe i will just contact you uh to just try to make it work yeah i mean you can also do it during a session or you can do it in advance or whatever all right all right man so we can close it here and you know what i think i'm gonna do i send you my notes uh i think they're not so crazy as normally they are uh because i try to make some sense of it and then yeah you do whatever you want with that um yeah i just gonna control it c and then i send it here yeah i'll try to write a little bit oh yeah i mean i'm i don't i try not to be a philosopher but i like writing and i think it's also thinking about the methodology and stuff it's good to write so i think it's important i think it's important we i think it's important that we just like them then first like this is the first time that i'm doing consciously this like basically while we're talking that i'm trying just to put some things together um so i think it's important because otherwise the we don't advance too much in the concept and i think it's important for like like but i think that the best i think the best like the best conceptual idea that we have through this session is that we're gonna use rihanna that was the best that the best after all this like two hours of talking is okay we agree rihanna is relevant for the practice at some point at some point yeah well i like rihanna i like rihanna i'm not joking i love that for cleaning and stuff or dancing but i feel like i put kids songs of course like rihanna's yeah so we can just all of them together listen to music like in instead of just you know playing it to live laugh you can just like you know play it we should create one practice as well like like just listening to catch music yeah just make your playlist and just play it i play this i have a play like this catch music in my youtube sounds good okay okay so keep in touch uh and let me know um i think it's interesting like from what you in terms of like the node 20 i think it's like definitely go for this idea of proposing these uh trackable qualities that's that that would work and the other thing is in a way try with your contacts with the ssl try to maybe find if there is somebody who has some around methodologies of archiving i don't know how you could try to reframe it trying to find people who can talk something about it that would be interesting for node for us you know okay okay thanks a lot charman peace"}}
